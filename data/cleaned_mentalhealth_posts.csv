1697558339.0,Am I lazy or depressed or anxious or do I just dislike my job?,"I want to start by saying...I do plan on meeting a psychiatrist soon. But I still want to talk about this. To someone.

I can't figure out if I am lazy or depressed or anxious or if I just dislike my job. It's true that the past 3 years have been especially rough - losing my brother, losing my sweet old dog, a terrible breakup, getting COVID twice, getting stuck in my hometown due to financial constraints etc. I know I am very sad. But lately, my brain has been feeling extra chaotic.

I've always been a procrastinator - but I always got away with it. Always got good grades etc. Even got a raise at my current job (a job I don't  like but it pays the bills). But now it's just becoming too much. I'm slacking off at work - I want to do the work but I am frozen. I just spend the entire time freaking out about the pending tasks but not actually doing them. Then I work secretly on the weekends to make up for all the delayed work. They are starting to notice. They probably regret the raise now lol. If there are deadlines I can do the work fast, while panicking and feeling ill the entire time. It also takes me time to process information or instructions. I end up working the entire day but still don't get stuff done. 

Even in my personal life, things are bad. I cannot really focus on things. Get distracted easily if I try to read (and I used to love reading). If someone's talking to me I zone out pretty fast. It's like there's a million thoughts racing in my head. It has always been like this (based on my diary entries) but it has never been this bad. I feel like I cannot function properly. I don't feel like doing anything - be it brush my teeth or take a shower. I also know I am a bit lazy intrinsically, but i don't know if what's happening is all laziness or it's a mix of stuff. 

I also feel like I'll always find a way to be anxious. To use it as an excuse maybe? There are many things I want to do but I do none of them and blame it on my mental health while doomscrolling and wasting time. Again this is just me and my thoughts. But how can I trust my own judgement? Maybe I am lazy but I'm trying to convince myself that it's more than that so that I don't feel stupid. 

There are hobbies I want to pursue but I just don't do anything. The hobbies I had are gone too. I'm just a hunk of meat working as a corporate slave and doing a bad job while at it. If I win the lottery will I feel more free? I'll probably find another reason to be sad. Something like ""Oh now you have all this money and still you're not doing anything good for society. You truly are lazy."" I want to do good. But I feel frozen. I want to feel normal but I don't put in the effort to get better.

I'm just so exhausted. It's so noisy in my head. The only way I can keep the noise down is by sleeping or scrolling through my phone or eating a lot. Even then, I feel the anxiety. And still I do nothing.",mentalhealth
1697552645.0,is puking due to anxiety normal?,"hi, i‚Äôve recently been incredibly anxious and puking almost daily. The anxiety is mostly caused by relationship things, at times I can combat it by going outside or for long walks, however when I‚Äôm in a stationary place (in class) I will often go to the washroom and puke (don‚Äôt make myself puke, just happens) in addition to crying.

1697558423.0,why are your 20's so lonely?,"I'm a 22F who just moved into my first apartment with my boyfriend 4 months ago. I work a full-time job and am overall a lot happier being independent than I was living with my family or being in school. However, I've just been feeling extremely lonely lately.

I'm not sure if this is related or not, but I have BPD, so I'm just more sensitive to certain things and life changes. It makes me sad that I can't see my friends as often as I used to because I've moved away from my hometown and everyone is busy with their own lives, jobs, and relationships. It sucks when people cancel plans more often or are even too busy for a phone call too.

Sometimes I get jealous that my boyfriend has friends who he can talk to and see more often than I can with my friends. Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm just not as important to my friends or something. I had lunch with my family last weekend, and my boyfriend was able to play video games with his friends and have a good time while I was gone. But my boyfriend is going to visit his dad next weekend, and I feel guilty for feeling sad about it because I tried making plans with my friends while he's gone but no one is available. I even went to a concert by myself for the first time a few weeks ago because no one wanted to go with me. It's not that I have a problem with being alone, I'm just ALWAYS alone or doing things by myself and sometimes it takes a toll on me. Even seeing people going out with their close friends all the time on social media gets to me too. Why can't I have a best friend who I can always count on to talk to or hang out with? 

I'm curious if anyone else has gone through this in their 20's? How do you even make friends as an adult?? It's hard too because ever since the COVID pandemic and past trauma with ex-friends and roommates, I have so much anxiety around strangers and the thought of getting close to someone new terrifies me. I appreciate any advice or thoughts. ü´∂üèº",mentalhealth

The only times it has stopped is when they‚Äôve pushed me over the edge, like when one who was especially cruel and kept punching my balls, until I yelled for him stop unless he wanted his face punched in and called him a f*cking c*nt. Another time was when kept bad mouthing me for months to my face and I, despite regretting it, punched him in the stomach.

I have depression, anxiety, ptsd, and inattentive add. i was doing ok over the summer time, i have my dream internship and i am with somebody i really do love, and my boyfriend(26) is really great to me. but i‚Äôve become more and more insecure about myself and my relationship. 

back story: my father has been verbally and emotionally abusive since i was 10. i am currently 22F and have been suffering from depression and anxiety since i was 12. my weight, how i looked, how i did in school work or activities, were never good enough, and he reminded me that all the time. i developed anxiety and was/ am scared to disappoint everyone i care for. i ended developing anorexia when i was in high school, trying to make my dad proud of me for being skinny, but it still wasn‚Äôt good enough. I ended up trying and developing bulimia for a short period of time and then went to binge eating disorder when covid hit. i was also in a 5 1/2 year long relationship that my ex tried cheating on me multiple times, and broke lots of boundaries, which made me have horrible trust issues.

Now to present time, i have been with my partner for almost a year and we‚Äôve been long distance pretty much all of it. he is a really good guys and he has been really reassuring at time when i feel really down. he doesn‚Äôt ditch me in my low moments but listens to how i feel. as much as a good guy he is and how well he treats me, i‚Äôm so scared of losing him and him cheating, even though i know he won‚Äôt do it. i‚Äôm so scared that i will screw everything up like i usually do. there has been so much i‚Äôve been through and i feel like a horrible person for my boyfriend to be dealing with that. i‚Äôm scared he would leave me for someone better and honestly i feel like i‚Äôm horrible in general and that i don‚Äôt deserve him or his love. it doesn‚Äôt help at all that he just moved to Colorado and I miss him so fucking much, and i‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll find someone there who is skinnier and smarter than me. 

i‚Äôm in the process of officially cutting my dad off for good because i just can‚Äôt take the abuse anymore. idk what to do about my relationship. i feel as though i constantly fail him. i make him miserable and i just can‚Äôt understand why he stays with me. i feel like i don‚Äôt deserve anything. all i want is to show love and make ny partner feel better and build our relationship back to the way it was. we were always happy and laughing about stupid shit. i miss that, i want that again. what do i do?.",mentalhealth

I started scrapbooking, painting, my apartment is always clean with natural sunlight, and I go to the gym, but these past couple weeks I felt like I'm going to explode.  I suppose I did last night.

I live with my roommate/friend and she is slowly trying to kick me out.  We don't really talk anymore.  My family is vocally disappointed in me constantly and I'm basically the black sheep.  I don't have any other friends.  My boyfriend called me last night yelling at me that I don't do enough for him or care about him, and had a friend in the background also cursing me out.

1697563053.0,"I hate people who have large social circles, who are popular and so on...","Hating on people with large social  circles is something I've wrestled with, and it's important to understand where these feelings come from. It's not easy to justify, but I'll try to explain.

For me, the root of this dislike often lies in personal experiences and emotions. I've had moments where I felt excluded or struggled to connect with others, which can lead to resentment. It's like feeling left out in the cold. Additionally, personal insecurities play a significant role. If I'm not particularly skilled in social situations or lack self-confidence, seeing others thriving in their social circles can make me feel even more inadequate.

These feelings of exclusion and the perception of being left in the cold have left a deep mark on my psyche. It's hard to shake off the memories of those moments when I yearned to be a part of something, but felt on the outside. 

Personal insecurities only add to the complexity of these emotions. My struggles in social situations, coupled with a lack of self-confidence, often amplify my feelings of inadequacy. Witnessing others thrive in their social circles can serve as a painful reminder of these insecurities.

Yet, acknowledging the irrationality of these emotions has prompted a shift in perspective.",mentalhealth

 I do it with the intention of venting and listening to advice, I am from Venezuela and currently my country has been experiencing a very complicated economic situation for more than 10 years. I feel that in some way this situation is already completely consuming me. I have had many desires to transform my life and escape the difficult situation I face in my country, but I feel that it is increasingly impossible.

My fervent desire is to live a better life, but opportunities in my country have been considerably reduced, economic inflation is very uncontrolled. To the point that the minimum wage in Venezuela is 5 dollars a month, I do miracles to survive every month. The lack of work and limitations in basic services has led me to have a perspective on my life and that perspective is that I feel like I have no future. Because of the stress I have been experiencing, I was diagnosed with ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" and I have only been able to calm my anxiety with exercises.

And because of that I have not received my payment to cover my personal expenses this month. I have tried every means to emigrate to another country but it is increasingly impossible for me, either because of the expenses that this entails or because I do not have family in other countries who can help me.

Skipped the psychiatrist meeting last week, couldn't be bothered at the time, don't want SSRIs again (which I was told by therapist they would give me).

Therapist and psychiatrist are in touch. Today he went, ""take your pills, you have to, or you risk spending the rest of your life in a small dark cell, go to the psychiatrist, go to the psychiatrist, go to the psychiatrist"".

He said, this time, I'll probably get lithium, as well as SSRIs.

Huh. Didn't expect that. ""You're saying I'm bipolar?"", ""We don't like to use names for it""

So. I'm not a big fan of medication unless it's used for acute life-saving purposes. What can I expect if I decide to take the pills? I will probably not take the SSRIs because I'm not that depressed, I'm just emotional and confused about what to do with my relationship and by extension my life.

As a kid I noticed I couldn't digest milk really well, so I stopped eating cereal and drinking milk. But as there was no actual proof of a lactose intolerance my parents kept making meals including lactose and I never really wanted to be a bother when staying over at friends or family either.

Because of covid the government made it possible to check medical results yourself online in 2020. That was when I noticed at age 7-8, when I got informed I had a dust mite allergy, there were also some elevated values for milk, so I took it I was lactose intolerant, which my doctor never told me. I was kinda mad at him because I had never felt validated in the milk intolerance thing and just thought I was exaggerating or imagining things. I didn't get to tell him personally though because I had already switched doctors by then.

My mom still goes to him and in 2021 asked him if she could be lactose intolerant as well because she's been having issues with milk lately. He goes on straight denying I even have it, and tells her lactose intolerance is a made up thing by the modern world....

Fast forward to last week, when I underwent a colonoscopy to rule out Crohn's disease and everything was perfectly fine. Doctors think I may have some food allergies or intolerances and tell me only allergies will show up on blood tests or skin-prick tests. To be sure there's an intolerance I would have to skip certain foods for an extended period of time and see if it has a positive impact on my digestion.

Today I suddenly realize that the milk thing did show up on a blood test though. So I look some more into it, and as it turns out I'm not lactose intolerant, but have an actual food allergy...

Can someone please tell me why there's a 20 year old blood test that proves a food allergy and my doctor just didn't bother to tell me because it's a 'made up new world thing'???

Because people can sniff out the weakness of me, they become entitled and try to play with my emotions. Being confronted or being put at spotlight for people to judge me and take away my rights is my biggest fear. For example the Amber Heard situation. I think about dating when everything feels normal, but then when the anxiety is high I think dating is dangerous for me because I can't control my emotions. I become aggressive and scared.

Despite this I crave interactions or else I will get crazy and even more emotional if I'm more isolated. So I want to go out and confront people.

Like many other people, I‚Äôm currently struggling a lot with loneliness.

 It goes all the way back to when I was 14 and I started isolating myself because of depression. Then COVID hit when I was 15 and ever since, I haven‚Äôt been the same person. I‚Äôm 19 now. 

It‚Äôs like I have forgotten how to make basic conversation. When I do, it‚Äôs fake, and people can tell. I can never enjoy social interaction, I don‚Äôt remember how to. All I do is ‚Äòsurvive‚Äô through an interaction. I say the things people want to hear, to make it go as smoothly and quickly as possible. To avoid saying something wrong; I treat conversations as if there is ‚Äòright‚Äô and ‚Äòwrong‚Äô answers to give instead of just experiencing it freely. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not present at all‚Ä¶ 

And then something more complicated: I don‚Äôt know how to turn my acquaintances into friends. The last friends I‚Äôve made were all pretty superficial connections. I‚Äôm usually okay with that but then it hurts so much when I see friends in the same friend group be way closer with each other than with me. I just don‚Äôt know how to get close to people anymore, and it‚Äôs killing me. 

It always feels to me like a friendship could end at any given moment. The concept of genuinely caring about someone outside of my family feels completely foreign to me. As well as having someone else care about me. That mutual support, loyalty, etc. I yearn for it so much but I have no idea how to get there. I feel stuck. 

I was wondering if you guys have any advice or experiences to share?

1. i have been getting in and out of extremely unhealthy ""talking stages"" where i would be either attached to the wrong person or extremely detached and use them temporarily, then they get attached and i leave, and its a cycle that never ends. i am aware that a lot of the time i am the problem but i don't know how to control myself.
2. i get very easily irritated by almost everyone around me, when someone talks for a little longer than i would like them to, if they say something i don't like, if they idk breathe the wrong way it just makes me want to close the door on them completely and sit alone for hours.
3. i have been experiencing extreme depressive episodes and the toughest part of them is that i live with my family and i cannot handle the pressure of having to act like im fine and smile and just idk ""be on my best behaviour"" i just want to rot in my bed till those episodes are over and it sucks.

So i did very bad mistake where i stopped Brintellix medication after two day use for 6 days. After 6 days i started it again/properly and it taked about two weeks when i started to feel little emotional bluntness and physical/odd feeling in head/brains. After those came i could have been save myself from this total life ruining depression but i continued medication as i probably generally needed it. Now i am in situation where i have worries and fears from those things which i experienced but probably they was just side effects and nothing worser. Any way now i fear/worry stopping it for 6 days and experiencing those side effects caused something permanent changes to me mentally and so on. Luckily my mum says my personality is same but only thing which haunts me is that mental ‚Äùnormal myself‚Äù feeling changes witch worries me although honestly i dont know does that kind of feeling even exist where there is mental feeling which is different to every person and i dont mean feeling which is related to personality or emotioanlity at all. I mean person characteristic state feeling which every person can feel every moment but again i dont know if is this just created in my mind and there is no thing like that. My mun has retired from work and she said that sound strange to her mind that kind of general feeling could exist so i dont know could that be thinked as hopeful thought.



So these days i am in work but its all i can do. I cant enjoy from my spare time at all and every evening ends to crying how all is lost and i ruined myself. In spare time i just watch tv and hang here in reddit altough i should do things that helps me to get better. Also being outside with friends is almost impossible as i get sad and anxiety so easily these days its horrible. Suicidal thoughts spins in my mind very often and i fear hurting myself but still i think if my condition wont improve in year after that i know i am not strong enough to think positive and i have tried therapy and also medication then i leave from this world. I have been with these worries about half year. My mum says things will get better and little brother keeps this reason to think suicidal things stupid as he has experienced much worser things than me. He is right but honestly its sad to think but what is reason to live when everything is just pure shit without happiness. On top of that i have diagnosed ocd when i was younger.

1697546488.0,Our neighbours stole from us and I am getting triggered,"Hello everyone, this is my first time making a post on reddit. I apologize if I am not able to explain the situation well enough.

So, I (21 F) am from India. me and my family, Grandma (63), Father (54), Mother (42), Brother (23) and Sister (8), moved into our new house beginning of August this year. This is our very first time being in a house we built in a property we own. it's not complete yet, there is supposed to be 4 floors but we moved in as soon as one of the floor was completed. 

This property is in the most posh area in our city and we are really fortunate to be able to live here, my father and mother have worked really hard with many jobs and businesses. We had been building our house for years, since 2011, little by little bc we couldn't afford to put much money in at a time. 

There are a lot of trees and wild plants in the property that we just started clearing and the day before yesterday, after clearing a big tree and we were able to look at part of our land clearer and my dad noticed that our neighbours' boundary wall was inside what is legally our land. they built this wall sometime between the years after the purchase of the land while we weren't living here. taking about 12-15 foot across and all the way down our property which is quiet a chunk.
Since we moved in they have started building something on that stole part of land to, what i assume, solidify this part under their possession. 

What can we do to get that piece of land back?
As the land here goes for very high rates I don't doubt that our neighbours would not be willing to give it back.

I asked my father what he plans to do about it and he said that what's done is done and what good would we get out of making things sour between us and the neighbours. Which really upset me.
my father hates confrontation and will avoid it even if it means severe financial and emotional damage.

Our family has been wronged by greedy people many times; we own a piece of land in a booming area for stores that makes it's market value very high and around 2010 the business owner who's property is adjacent to ours tried to get land grabbing gundas involved, forcing themselves in by breaking  locks and refuses to leave, public threatening where both my parents where beaten, my moms hair was pulled, my dad had machete put against his neck, etc. my dad was willing to give it up completely but because of mother's persistence and much illegal battle we finally got things under control. Another such property related situation was my dad putting his brother on the documents of the land they bought together out of respect and later his brother treating the property as only his and making us pay monthly rent for living in the house that was built on the land they equally contributed to. 

On a personal note, he literally didn't do anything when I was repeatedly raped by my step cousin, he didn't do anything when I was molested by our family friend who was close to my grandfather's age. It hurts to know for a fact that if someone were to do something terrible to you tomorrow your own father would not stand up for you. 

This situation of our neighbours stealing land from us and my father not doing anything about it has been, tbh, triggering. I hate injustice, I hate when shitty people do shitty things and get away with it, I hate when people don't stand up for what right. I just want my dad to stand up against such injustice.

It's becoming really difficult for me with my own issues. I have asked him numerous times to stop discussing it and he brings it up over and over . He is basically throwing away his education. I feel he has depression and this escapist and cowardly doctrine is just a get out of jail free card for him somehow. I have tried to encourage him to get treatment. He refuses to do anything but complain and say that all the news means the end of the world is imminent.  

One of his mates described him as a ""paranoid fundamentalist autistic schizophrenic asshole"". Not really nice, but the truth is he often does act like an asshole. I suffer from mental illness and I think he does too, but he has no consideration for anyone. I blew up at him yesterday because he won't stop talking about it. He is obsessed. He has decided that his education is meaningless because Jesus is returning. I have strong beliefs in Christ but the rapture is total bullshit. He is driving me insane and refuses to see that he has gone down a rabbit hole . I pointed out there are rapture videos ten years old and people have believed this for centuries and still here we are and the world is still here and Jesus has not come back. I have no idea how to handle this anymore but to talk less to him. He is stressing me out and he is frightening me, he is like a maniac about it at this point. I am super angry he has no sensitivity for anyone, and although he has no diagnosis because he won't seek treatment, I suffer from a lot of shit and don't hold people hostage to my belief system like he does. I feel like he is just bullying me and told him so.  Fuck him, I'm pissed. ",mentalhealth
1697532120.0,"I don't know how to move forward after this, they could have lied.","I've had lots of online sexual encounters in the past, particularly on NSFW reddit subs such as r/dirtyr4r and those places don't require actual age verification so for the majority of people I've met I've just taken it at face value for how old they were. And for the past few days I've been thinking of if I've done something illegal or not.

This sort of thing happens all the time and those sub reddits remain up but I still think of if I encountered several that may have possibly lied. I recall actually that I made a post looking for folks on r/dirtyr4r (a place that stated 18+ only) and they never said their age at first. I was 20 when most of these encounters occurred, the same time I became more promiscuous when I'd post nudes online and when I discovered I was bi. 

I thought they were 18 given the sub stated adults only and after we had some conversation and they sent a dick pic that I said was the best one I've ever received they said they were 16. Immediately I sort of freaked out and asked why they were here and what made them think it was OK. They said in the UK since aoc is 16 they thought it was fine. I'm from the UK too and while the aoc is 16, sending nudes is 18 and over.

I said this to them. The conversation was ceased and i reported them their account was banned. Even after this though I still thought just emphasising adults only in the descriptions of my posts was enough. Ultimately I was still taking people's word for truth though. I actually got banned myself for posting too much eventually (I figured since everyone seemed to keep reposting I'd do the same) and i haven't posted their since. I actually briefly contemplated going back to it recently but now that I've sort of had this fear I definitely do not.

I've made and sent very explicit content to some folks through text and imagery and I've received things obviously.

Even places like omegle with an 18+ section don't have any real verification and I've went there a few times in the past year (not showing myself on cam though).

1697549492.0,"ILLNESS DISCOVERY (potentially) , I FEEL FREE ‚ù§Ô∏è","Hi,

I (24M) have always felt neurodivergent or just typically not normal, this was always challenging growing up trying to find out why I was different; I mean this not as an offence but just my own observation but it seems neurodivergence is easier to accept if the persons appearance is also not considered normal or attractive. However growing up I remember from pretty young always being told I was handsome or good looking right up to now (as a child this was not meant inappropriately towards me, and do not recall any reports of SA below the age of 13) 

ANYWAY, fast forward to now. I have recently just ruined my life, one year ago I had 50k in the bank, a V8 Mercedes, fiance, baby on the way and big dreams and aspirations. This is all gone now. I still live with my ex, and baby until I start rehab in a few weeks.

 I developed a serious coke addiction late last year while making a lot of money selling uhhh adult street medicines, not long after my partner had fallen pregnant and also being diagnosed with depression and anxiety around the same time, which I started taking meds for. I believe what unfolded was a result of huge unrealised/unresolved child hood trauma, bullying, undiagnosed illness, mental health and not wanting to become my parents. Over the course of this time an entirely different version of myself surfaced, that would come out and piece by piece rip its/my own life apart right down to its core. 

Now, getting to the point finally. After doing some looking inwards over the last few weeks and a heavy amount of research I have come to the very synonymous conclusion that I was undiagnosed with autism as a kid which has now manifested as BPD, and potentially ADHD too. Not to be a hypochondriac, I need to have everything assessed and diagnosed.

This was incredibly freeing to feel, and relate to the things I was reading and finding. I hope it wasn‚Äôt confirmation bias and I was looking to attach to anything I could relate to. But I feel in my gut that my findings are right. I can finally stop ruining my life when I‚Äôm in relationships, I can be a good father, I can get treated FINALLY, I can be myself and I can control this dark horrible other side of myself that exhibits when i split, I can stop abusing drugs and alcohol and seek healthier coping mechanisms. I have never felt so motivated and happy to get my life on track before but I‚Äôm going to fix myself, because I was scared I was gonna remove myself from this world if I didn‚Äôt figure this out sooner or later. I can now have an explanation to all those I hurt when I was having an episode, and apologise to all of them. Thank you all for reading, please comment or DM me if you relate to this in some way and/or have any advice to offer ‚ù§Ô∏è

EDIT : For context, before my mental health deteriorated, I was very out going, big social circle, well liked/good reputation and I was very happy mostly. But I didn‚Äôt realise this was because I was riding the high of the relationship leading up to this and actually treated my partner like shit without realising that I might have BPD and I was afraid to have a low. Because in relationships, your SO is a massive trigger for BPD symptoms and this explains why my last 2 relationships failed and resulted in my ass getting dumped or cheated on.",mentalhealth

I‚Äôm always anxious , always angry, always on edge. 

My childhood was TRAUMATIC. Mental and physical abuse everyday from my father. 

I left home and got married by myself. 

I want to be a better mum. Cooking makes me anxious. Going grocery shopping can make me have a mini panic attack because of my sons fussiness, financial aspects and just the stress of having to be organised.

I also have a partner with the same life circumstances as me. 

I also know that a lot of my friends struggle financially and that I am privileged in that way, which is why I rarely if ever complain to them about my life, but always listen to them when they feel down and support them on their life journey every way I can.

I have access to health care and a partner that can support me if I lose my job, but it‚Äôs still unclear if I will ever be well enough to return to work.

I'm writing here because lately I'm feeling very confused and absolutely terrified of the future.
I explained myself better: I'm 28 [m], and I'm at a point in my life where I feel I have no direction. 
I do a job that doesn't satisfy me, yet I'm unable to change it, because I am afraid to land somewhere even worse, besides every job I hated every job did until now. I am very passionate about art and music, all stuff that do not guarantee a future and are very little job offers (I work on IT btw), and everyday I want to cry and laugh and now I want to quit and later I want to stay.
 Also I do boxing, but have had very few fights, because I am also terrified of the ring and people yelling and judging. So I'm not sure here too, because I love the sport but unable to fight and everyday I feel like I want to and the next day I'm glad I didn't ask my trainer to find an opponent. 
I also have a gf and here too I feel so confused that one day I think she's the one and the next day I want to leave her. 

Basically in every part of my life I feel like I have no clue of what I'm doing. I always thought life would settle itself when growing up, but it doesn't.
 I came to the bitter acceptance that it's like this but I also feel that a life like this is not worth living, yet I'm not depressed. 
I'm constantly shifting mood and thoughts and I can laugh and cry and be mad and happy, often I'm so confused that I don't even recognize my own emotions and it' terrible because sometimes I can't even explain what I'm feeling.
Some days it even seems to me life is just a dream and that I'm going to wake up one day, or that we just live into a simulation.
I'd like to know if someone else feels the same way or if it's just me...

Btw I'm seeing a psychologist but not sure if she's helping me... If you ask me now I'd say no, if you asked me yesterday I'd say yes. She wanted to prescribe me some meds for mood shifts and I let you imagine what I thought of it... And what I thought the day after..

So that's it, it would help having some confrontation with someone who feels the same/someone who overcame the feeling.

I remember thinking I was having a stroke I couldn't move at all expect for my hands twitching. I hallucinate my partner came home from work , I hallcunated getting up and a spray bottle attacking me and me screaming so loud.i imagined getting and then collapsing on the floor.  I hallucinated different people coming and speaking to me through the door. Everytime I thought I was awake I never was. I managed to roll over and stuff but I just couldn't snap out of it.

one thing i've realized is that we tend to downplay someone else's trauma or mental health issues. for instance, i once heard about a friend's trauma, and it seemed small to me, something i could easily brush off with my mental capacity. however, when i had to deal with my own trauma, it felt like the worst thing in the world.

now, i can see that my friend's trauma might have felt as significant to them as mine does to me upon knowing that there might be people who even think that my issue is something they can brush off as well. it's not about comparison because everyone's mental health capacity is different, and they deal with situations based on that capacity. no matter how big or small an issue may seem, it can profoundly affect someone. so, i learnt to avoid saying things like, 'your issue isn't that big; i deal with so much more,' because we might not know the significance of the situation to that person and what it's associated with.

this is what i've realized, and i wanted to share it with everyone here as a reminder to help those around us, no matter how significant or insignificant their issues may appear to us. you never know how much it means to them and what it represents in their lives.

so, i learnt to be more available and understanding towards people who matter to me and who deserves to be heard. i learnt that i should reach out to peeps when they're down, big or small issues and being that friend who listens. after all, a small act can make a big impact. let's all create a world where everyone's struggles are respected.",mentalhealth

When looking it up all I see is about not having feelings, but that's not it. An example would be that I was kinda happy yesterday. I remember the event that made me happy, the fact that I was happy, but I have no clue about how the happiness felt. I don't remember how it feels to be happy until I'm happy, and then I remember it for an hour or two, and forget again. Same with basically every emotion. And pain too. The only thing I actually remember is strict information. Visuals, things I hear, some smells, line of events and the thoughts at the moment of the memory. Other than that it's basically blank. I don't remember the feeling itself, only that I was feeling it. So, is this normal?",mentalhealth
1697543575.0,I need some advice/help -,"So I did hit for the first time some weed with my friend but I guess I over smoked myself and got a panic attack so bad.

For a week I was constant dealing with panic and stress and anxiety so I started thinking like I died and Im still sleeping and wont wake up ever again, started thinking that when I wake up I wont recognize my family, my wife and I was so sad about that, I was thinking that I will forget everything in my life.

After that I went to a neurologist (i have migraine) and I asked him why my hands and my feet shake and feel totally numb, same as my head?

they made a test like if I was good with my motor movements and the doc told me that You only have anxiety u weel anxious and dont read or think bad things because thats what it will trigger more.

After that I checked some of my meds that I use for migraine, Sumatriptan was one of them and started reading that sumatriptan if its used to much it will cause loss of memory... so while reading and remembering the night i smoked i got in a loop that I was dead Im not living a normal life anymore.

So now Im ok i took control about my emotions and thoughts, i feel better and Im not getting a numb leg/hand/head or anything. I started feeling normal now but sometimes I get some intrusive thoughts for ex Im really happy and our of a sudden my mind says ""wait are you feeling this moment for real?"" and I understand that the anxiety will hit me and I try to control it for like 1 min and I feel better.

I would like to know if anyone was the same and did anyone else overcome all of this situation, Im just worried about if Ill stay on this forever, or if it will affect my marriage, my family knows about this right now I told them.

I don't have a diagnosis of anything specific but I see a psychologist for anxiety and depression related symptoms that mostly only manifest in bigger issues at work. I had an overly critical and mood swinging mother so I get really sensitive to other people's bad moods.  

Does anyone have any tools or reading I could have a look at about how to let go of bad emotions after a fight with a friend?  I feel like there's an emotional side and logical side of me and while I've said constantly to myself, you can't control other people, you can only control how you react, after a fight about something stupid where someone has said something really cruel and unfair to me, all I can keep doing is circling on the argument and feeling guilty like I've done something wrong, but logically I know I haven't. For whatever reason, they were in a bad mood or stressed and snapped at me.  

I can't logic myself out of feeling shitty and guilty and like I've caused it, I've tried to accept I couldn't do anything different, but its hanging around like a grey aura and making me feel like I can't do any of the hobbies I like to take my mind off it, and can't stop feeling like I hate myself and I'm worthless and I just can't watch TV or crochet, or read a book.  I feel trapped in a vortex of misery.

I can't resolve it because they've blocked me on social media and to be honest its probably not a good time so soon after to try and fix it.  I don't know what to do, or what CBT or mental health lessons or books to read about the above type of thing.

They will probably do surgery on him tomorrow (well today now, 2am) to move the breathing tube from the mouth to the neck so he‚Äôs more comfortable and to see if he can breathe on his own.

Yesterday at 3pm my brother calls me saying that he‚Äôs at the emergency vet with my dog, Pluto a little chihuahua. He was attacked by my cousins vicious pitbull. But at first my brother told me it was my other dog, Astro a German shepherd which I knew was false because Astro is super friendly and submissive. The nurse tells us he was stable and his Temperature was going back to normal that my brother and cousin could leave if they needed to do other things. So I left the hospital and went to the vet and by the time I got there (public transport) they had taken cat scans and nurse tells me his breathing tube? or I think might‚Äôve been his voice box, was shattered, and his jaw was fractured. She said she‚Äôs not worried about the jaw but the neck one it could be bad. She recommended we euthanize him due to his age and said other things but I just couldn‚Äôt hear them.

1697533563.0,Should I get a second assessment or is this normal?,"Hi all - I was diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder back in 2016. I would regularly go through periods of intense lows (usually every 6-12 month-ish, sometimes longer). They were often triggered by something but not always. I would end up back at the docs for SSRI meds and then rinse and repeat..

Last month I had a huge depressive episode and ended up being assessed at a psych hospital. I'd recently quit smoking cannabis and was having some relationship difficulties.. then out of nowhere I just completely dissociated and don't really remember much of the whole process. I've had the intensive home treatment team come out to see me daily and my family were keeping an eye on me.

After speaking with some of my family & friends now the fog has cleared a bit, and also giving myself some time to reflect on why I get like this.. etc.. I realised I behave very odd in between my depressive episodes.

I'm an absolute commitmaphobe and have never lived with or moved in with a girl (I'm nearly 35).. I'm very unstable in the relationship but I wouldn't say I have a fear of abandonment per se, I just feel I want it, then I don't... then I question if it's right... and then I desperately want her back.. etc..

I'm also an incredibly impulsive and selfish person.. setting up business ventures, staying up late researching ideas and investing in start-up equipment often costing me a fortune... however, it's awesome when I'm doing it but often my mood changes and I abandon.

I'm also incredibly irritable and and often on the edge which has lead to physical confrontations before.

I'm just worried about how I can be as my lows seem to be getting more intense with age and also more unpredictable. The most recent one was concerning as it was the first time I actively felt like making a plan to end it. There wasn't a specific trigger which warranted such a huge deline.

Is this typical of recurrent depressive disorder? Or should I perhaps go back to my GP and discuss this? I'm always quite careful when it comes to labelling myself, but certain traits and behaviour at the moment are making life very difficult.

I'm currently on 100mg of Sertraline.

Thanks.

1697531500.0,I don't know what to do,"Some years ago I had a best friend and I moved in with them. Things didn't go so well as tends to happen in most cases. I found out the real kind of person they were which wasn't a very nice person. I only lasted a month before I was worried I would do something I wouldn't be able to regret. 

Instead I took a step back from those thoughts and plans and called someone in a nearby state closer than my original home before moving in and asked for help to get me out. To this day I've said the people who got me out saved me but until last year never told them exactly what that meant. 

On the day I moved out I got blocked and I was blocked for 3 years. When I was finally getting over everything, realizing how bad the situation was, and not missing the friendship as much anymore, they unblocked me and added me to a group message trying to plan a trip. 

For the last year and a half I haven't been able to get everything about that person and the situation out of my head. I have no closure and I want it. I wrote up a whole message stating how I felt with everything that happened and how I'm feeling about it all now and part of me wants to send it to my ex best friend and see if that gives me closure. 

The other part of me thinks that I'm just never gonna have closure and will just be stuck on this. My partner thinks I'm too stuck on it which makes me want to send the message, but at the same time I want to talk to my partner about me having a message I want to send and I want them to tell me it's okay to send the message. I might send it regardless of what my partner says, but I don't want it hidden. 

I just don't know whether I should send the message. Could it really help give me closure cause I finally get to explain myself when I was never given the chance before? Do I tell my partner and how do I even bring it up when my partner has already expressed a dislike in how much mental energy I've unfortunately put into the situation. My mind just won't stop on them because I'm unblocked and I have so much I want to just let out without a need for an answer as I was never given the chance to defend myself.",mentalhealth

He was kinda like the class clown so it was always a great time to be around him. When I got closer to him, I realised his ‚Äúhappy go lucky‚Äù image was just a mask and he was dealing with some stuff. That being said, in our school days, he wasn‚Äôt depressed but had some low days. However, once he would talk to me and our other friends, he‚Äôd be just fine and go back to being his normal chirpy self.

After school, he moved to different country. He went to Australia and I stayed home. In his uni days, he developed depression and would talk about it sometimes but not overshare.

Now, he‚Äôs moved back to our hometown. His depression has gotten BAD and that‚Äôs all we talk about. He expects me to be there for him always and it‚Äôs getting too exhausting. We literally only talk about his issues every time we meet or when he calls. He just feels low all the time and he doesn‚Äôt even feel like the same best friend I had back in high school.

I‚Äôm cool with most of them, and I thought me and this person were cool too, but I don‚Äôt know anymore. 

We were all hanging out eating food and having a pretty good time, and got back to this persons dorm, I‚Äôll call ‚ÄúI‚Äù. Even though we‚Äôre a bit awkward I thought everything was good. But anyways we were play fighting and joking around, and I said I dislike him. You would know it was sarcasm because of the statements I had said before, and I said it in a joking manner.

I proceeds to go ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like you.‚Äù I kind of prod him because sometimes when he talks his face is really serious and I genuinely can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs joking or not, so I said ‚Äúyou really don‚Äôt like me? What did I do?‚Äù also in a joking manner, because with these kinds of things, becoming serious kind of ruins the vibe.

I‚Äôll tell you why in a year.‚Äù keep in mind our dorming arrangements are usually different by year, so maybe that‚Äôs what he was referring to. That we‚Äôd stop being friends in a year and he would tell me then? 

Still, it really irked me and left me with this feeling weighing on my chest that‚Äôs causing me to feel like I was just punched in the gut. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just reading into it too much or it‚Äôs just that something about my autism he doesn‚Äôt like because it gives off ‚Äúuncanny valley effect‚Äù or something, and allistic people tend to have a natural aversion to autistic people, because we actually think, and whenever they see us thinking and in that moment completely unmasked, somewhere subconsciously they take a note of that ‚Äúunnatural behavior‚Äù. 

I might just be playing in my tendency to be neurotic and blame myself, but ever since I was young, a lot of people just straight up didn‚Äôt like me and I never knew why, and this is making me feel like the little kid who was always treated like shit again.

He's recently been threw a break up witch hasent helped his mood but I did what I could there without involving myself too much as that's between the 2 of them and nothing to do with me 

He's also been affected by one of his best friends committing suicide, don't know much about this bit as its one of his friends back home. But I do know it stings when he remembers anything to do with it. I would like for him to talk about it more to relive the felling about it but not gonna force it 

Now is where this gets personal about him and he asked me not to say anything to anyone of our friends, which I'm not but I still need advice on what to do 

We where out drinking a few nights ago having a good time, now only mentioning this as its relifent to the story but I've recently started to speak to this other boy who I fancy and he was on the night out with use, plus my best friend is straight so he not Jealous or anything, infact he helped the 2 of use get together.

But anyway on the night out he's seen me being really extaticly happy and he mentions it a few times which I cringed at but did say yes I am. Now he did seem OK at this point nothing out of the norm but was a little sus at this. So later on in the night is where it went a bit down hill 

He asked be to go for a fag which I won't refuse but only me as he wanted to talk, so I was like OK no prob just let me tell David [potential bf] that where away for a smoke 

We got out side and chatted a bit like normal then ne got really weird, he first of wasn't gona say till the next morning which got my attention so I was like you can't tell a bitch that and not expect me to ask questions 

Now thus went on for a bit to the point where I was concerned that he wasn't telling me anything 

He eventually told me ""do you ever just not bothered with the whole thing ""

I knew exactly what he was talking about and I've even got his confirmation that's what's it was about 

Now he threatened our friendship if I said to anyone of our friends so I'm not gona do that 
I told him any feelings of doing something stupid you get on the phone to me right away, and possibly speak to someone professional about this which he said no too but that side of the story isn't done yet cause I will get him into the mind set of speaking to someone as I'm all well and good talking ot out But I'm no professional 

He made me promise to act normally the rest of the night witch I did but keeped an eye out on him as best I could 

But I just don't know what to think or do I can't have my best friend be going threw this alone and potentially do something stupid ill be damed if it gets that far, and I hope that he's not thinking now I have a potential bf that I'm gona forget about him cause that ain't gona happen

So... I've been throwing up every morning. Not food, nothing I've eaten or drank ever comes up, it's always just a yellowish bile.

Work right now is hella busy pressure so I have to conclude that this is tied to my job (like... the thing you do 9 hours per day is obviously going to have a major mental health impact). But what the hell do I do? I'm self-employed now, work isn't ever going to be not-stressful.

CBT is useless. It's just 'have you thought about *not* being stressed lol?' I was put on citalopram once for anxiety and it was the worst two weeks of my life, no meds. Has anyone experienced this, and have they found anything that helps?

1697526339.0,Any suggestions help,"I (27M) am just getting to a point where I am only living to make sure I don't hurt those that would be affected by my passing. I don't feel suicidal in the sense that I want to die, I just feel like I haven't had much purpose as of late. I'm very much a homebody and that self-isolation has killed all relationships I had with friends, leaving me without much of a social network and I have never been one to share much of the emotions that I am feeling. Last year I was involved in a brief relationship where the girl liked me a lot, but being in a not so great mental place, I eventually drove her away with my own self-sabatoging tactics, but we remained friends. Fast-forward to the last 3 months I have felt more able to feel emotions, and really began to develop feelings for the same girl, who now has a boyfriend. We texted all the time and played games, and she expressed that she was having feelings for me again, however, she doesn't really know what she wants in life right now, and doesn't feel comfortable blowing up her life. I don't blame her decision, as I hurt her pretty badly in the past, so it all feels like it's come full circle and I got what I deserved, a broken heart for a broken heart. This girl is important to me, so I want to continue to be friends if I can handle that. Some of how I feel is because this happened recently, but this feeling of no purpose and being alive and functional for others has been something in my mind for a while. Just not really sure how to find purpose in a life that I keep self-sabatoging due to fear, and not sure where to start picking up the pieces.

1697526081.0,Need help understanding what I am dealing with,"For some background info, I am an autistic (self diagnose after countless hours poured into the DMSs diagnostic requirements for autism as well as anecdotes from autistic teens and adults, I'm not in a situation currently where I can get a professional diagnosis) 18 year old person who struggles with mental health issues. I grew up as a ""gifted"" kid, and unfortunately was sexually groomed from the ages 14-16 causing me to self harm as well as attempt suicide, which I believe caused some sort of trauma related amnesia as I have very little recollection of those years.

Recently, I have been struggling a lot with my mental health and I suspect it has to do with some type of mental disorder, as much of it seems to stem from nothing at all. To begin, I very often dissociate or go into a state of derealization, typically whenever topics surrounding pedophilia, self harm, or suicide are mentioned. While it is sometimes triggered by those topics, it also happens randomly some days and leads to me not being able to tell what is reality and what isn't/recalling events as a dream I had only to learn later it actually happened. I also have been dealing with manic and depressive episodes often, and along with my depressive episodes I also get into these thought loops about horrible things like self harm, suicide, rape, and more that seem to never end and prevent me from being able to sleep a lot of the time. I think a lot of it stems from anxiety, but as I mentioned I am having lots of issues with dissociation which gives me a lot of ""brain fog"" and makes it difficult for me to pinpoint my emotions and thoughts during these episodes.

I originally believed I was dealing with schizotypal personality disorder as well as bipolar disorder because of what I have been experiencing. However, I'm having trouble recognizing whether or not schizotypal is something I could be dealing with because many of the antisocial and ""weird"" traits that are seen in schizotypal are similar to traits of autism, and I have built compensatory mechanisms for my social awkwardness which allow me to function as a ""normal"" member of society.

I would like to get a psych panel or evaluation so I can hopefully seek treatment (whether its through medication or through therapy) but unfortunately I am in a household which is very anti-diagnosis and do not have access to that resource right now.

Just for some timeframes, I am having manic and depressive episodes around 8 or 9 times a month each, derealizing every day or every other day, having thought loops about every other day, and having thoughts of suicide or self harm about one in three days.

Whenever I ""talk"" with him, the vision in my head is that I (meaning me) is sitting in a chair and chained up, confined in a circle. He floats around me and we have conversations. Or sometimes, I won't be chained up or confined. Sometimes, we both want him to come out and take control, but we both know it won't be possible. Whenever I go through a difficult situation, he pops up in my head and gives me a wake up call, but it does't always help me.

1697496603.0,I've tried therapy twice and it doesn't feel like it's made any difference,"There are many things I could list that I don't like about myself. I don't really get any satisfaction from life. I have no friends, no hobbies. I have difficulty trusting people. I have difficulty concentrating on things. I get anxious about things like making phonecalls and put them off until the thing I need to call about is too urgent to be ignored. I manage to pay my bills well enough but that's just surviving. Life isn't worth living unless you're, well, *living*.

I first tried going to therapy 5 years ago through the UK's NHS. The therapist was empathetic but the system itself didn't really seem to care; I was given a form every session with questions like ""on a scale of 1 to 10 how likely are you to hurt yourself?"" and because I was low-risk they just wanted me out the door.

I tried again early this year through private health insurance who had to choose my therapist for me (I only seem to be able to choose my own if I pay out-of-pocket) and we barely discussed anything. Every session we re-treaded the exact same thing, I felt like we were going in circles. I'd say I dislike how little I enjoy life, and how I don't have any hobbies. He'd ask ""does it *matter* if you don't have any hobbies?"" And I say ""I suppose technically no but-"" and he'd say ""then what's the problem?""

But I also don't want to ignore the possibility that *I'm* the problem. That maybe I expected therapy to be a magic fix that can be done *to* me without me putting in any extra effort. Maybe I'm just stubborn and have a shitty personality that refuses to work on myself.",mentalhealth

I am not really sure where this post is meant to be headed, but I kind of wanted to just write my thoughts. I was watching a video about not wanting to exist and why its such a common thing that is so rarely addressed and in the video, the commenter was explaining how not wanting to exist is different from wanting to di3. Not wanting to exist is simply just wanting to disappear; no pain, and no difficulty. Just disappearing. But then this kind of got my wheels turning about wanting to di3. In head head I started thinking how wanting to di3 is more then just simply not wanting to live, but it‚Äôs wanting to end suffering and pain. It really took me aback because from what I was thinking, wanting to di3 almost sounds like using pain to end pain? It really gave me more of a perspective into the mind of suicid3 and simply put it, I guess understand what it means to want to di3; its giving up hope in all other options.

Recently I've just really noticed, the worst time, is actually the morning.

(But I can't leave, because everyone knows and accepts I don't do much socialising and just want to work)

\- my debt is ever increasing

(I can't control my finances, I'm embarrassed about the state I'm already in, so unable to seek help)

\- my health feels like it's getting worse every day

(I can't do jobs that'll involve a bigger commute, because I know I'll be exhausted by the time I get there)

I also did something really stupid, out of loneliness, and bought a pup a couple weeks back. Work colleagues know I've been missing Frank massively and so they were all super pleased, and I did feel good, until he came home and I realized I was trying to hold down a job, and look after a little pup. So I had to make the heart-breaking decision to let him go and I am really beating myself up for it, not only the wasted money, but I now get asked about him a lot, but can't bring myself to admit I failed and now I've got myself in a circle of lies saying he's with family and that I've not got my phone, so no photos.

Sorry, ended up on a bit of a waffle. But yeah, is it normal to feel low, or consider silly things in the morning? it feels like it never stops.

1697517588.0,Not too sure what to title this,"19m, when I was 18 I starting smoking weed and I really got into it I smoked almost everyday usually for the entire day,(smoked from june 2022 to February 2023). In early February 2023 I had ran low and only smoked like 3 times in a 2 week span and during that time i felt off while sober, I don‚Äôt really know how to describe it(I might be saying that a lot in this post) but then I was at a friends and I was just thinking about random stuff and i thought about something that made me anxious and I started having a bad high so I went up to my friends, told them so they could help calm me down, I joined their conversation and they were talking about beyond crazy conspiracy theories that they believed in and I consumed all of that information and it freaked me the fuck out. For the next 2 days I didn‚Äôt smoke and I was constantly thinking about what they were saying and I was anxious all day, then 3 days after the conversation I got way too high for my own liking  at my friends and i starting thinking about the conversation which made me beyond anxious. I haven‚Äôt smoked weed since that day it‚Äôs been 9 months now. But since then life has not felt real at all. It was pretty much constant for the first 3 months or so but then it got better only feeling like that for either a day or a couple weeks at a time. My girlfriend says it could be psychosis but I‚Äôm not sure. Does anyone know what could have happened and how I can deal with this? It feels like I‚Äôm not the same person I was before that conversation.

Edit: for that 3 months where it was bad, like the first month or 2 I was thinking about the conversation constantly worried about the shit they said now I‚Äôm good not worried about the stuff at all but I still have the feeling life isn‚Äôt real. Like I‚Äôm in a simulation or in a coma dream waiting to wake up.",mentalhealth

1697517087.0,Severe anxiety that is has taken over my life.,"So for the past 3 months I've gone through very severe anxiety out of nowhere. It started with me waking up from shakes and diarrhea and that went on for a few days. I did a blood check and ultra sounded my organs, everything was clear. Then I started working through a lot of my emotional trauma with my dad and my past, it was fine and dandy up until I fixated on one thing.

So in 2020 I was quite stupid and I'd party a lot. I went over to my friend's place a few times and she had this thc vape thingy. Me being the dude that loves weed I took a few drags of it for like 5 times every weekend or so for about a month. We'd have smoke sessions and all, last time I did it in 2020 I got a little anxiety for 15 minutes then it went away. I stopped doing it and later I find out it's not actually weed, it's this synthetic thc that I did. Although when I did it, it felt like a normal high and nothing really happened to me when I smoked it. After I stopped I didn't get any withdrawls. So fast-forward to now 3 years later, it's all I think about. It's killing me because of how stupid I was and how easily I could've avoided it. There's nothing good about it and everything I search about it is horrible, I hear horror stories everywhere, I'm afraid I somehow fucked my brain up for good and nothing is helping me get out of this mindset. I did therapy, I went to a neorlogist, I talked to friends and family I opened up. I meditated, I'm eating somewhat healthy. Nothing is working and it's killing me.

I know that it's out of my system and I know that brain recovers and all. But I fear that I have done something that has fucked my future up for good. These are research chemicals and no one knows what it does. I'm desperate, I don't know what to do and I need your help. This is so specific and I have no one to relate to, like I would've been fine if I did any other hard drug tbh but not this....this is terrifying. I keep thinking my life is over. I really fucked up this time. 

Please I need your help, I'm usually a person who knows how to overcome things like this. But this is killing me.",mentalhealth
1697515462.0,"I stop having contact with the family of my partner. I want and need to get over it, so I can continue with my life.","I have been through some bad things almost 2 years now, broken bone, broken family, lost job, house, etc. Due to all the prior things, I have tried to just focused in my mental health, all my decisions have been based on that, although it seems like my choices haven't been the best ones. 

Long story, I'm not native English speaker, if you have advice for my grammar I will appreciate.

I have a really small business where I sell pet stuff, but since I didn't have a place to store my things anymore. I had to temporarily left the things in the ""house"" of my partner's family. I left them a Thursday, on Friday $15,000(not dollars) worthy of my stuff was stolen. In this house, only the mother of my partner lives let's call her Susan and there's a mechanic that rents the yard to work for only $300 to the grandparents. What I was told is that Susan left the mechanic in charge of the house because she was leaving for a few hours, when she returned the things were gone.

Context: The house is from nobody, the family of my partner technically took the house when the owner abandoned it and the mother is living there cause she has nowhere to go, but the house is practically falling down.

The mechanic said that he was in the door all the time and no one entered, that we didn't had all those things stolen and that she was lying. Pretty suspicious obviously (take this in mind for later).

We discussed the robbery with the family and to my surprise they took the mechanic's side, saying they could not do anything, and that it was our fault for not closing the room (take into account that it was in the second floor not at first sight).

Weeks go by, and the mechanic now accused us of stealing him like $100 worth of things. He proceeds to threatened our life's and to damage my motorcycle. We were so scared that we closed the house and change the lock to prevent him to enter the house.

Well, it turns out that the grandparents want us to let him enter the house, they did not care for the threats. We refuse obviously, for the our safety and Susan's safety, we stayed with her a few days to care for her. 

Again weeks go by, and everything starts going worse to worse, the grandparent went to the house with the mechanic and more people, when we arrived they tried to hit my partner and were really violent. The grandparent is telling us to open the door, we get into a verbal fight ( the grandson of the mechanic  admitted he stole our things), ended calling the police. 

After all of that, they are talking behind my back telling everyone that I'm a bi***, that I'm brainwashing my partner and his mom. Also, the house is like a storage for some working people of the market, and they are saying that things have been stolen before and no one is saying anything that I shouldn't complain and that I'm exaggerating, that the mechanic is taking legal action for something invented of course, and they start making excuses and inventing gossips, telling them to family in order for they to come and hit us.

At this point, we were soo confuse, so sad, so disappointed that we didn't know what to do because nothing made sense. All of this takes us to the last day were I exploited. Before this day, I haven't said much, but they broke me. They have told Susan that the mechanic was going back we wanted or not because they needed the rent money for her candy and soda. We even offered to pay for that, but that wasn't the problema, we don't understand it yet. I decided that it was enough, I didn't have much money but I preferred to take my stuff to a storage and forget about all of this.

A few hour go by, and I received a message from Susan with screenshots of the father of my partner saying bullsh** about me because he saw the post where I was looking for a storage. Saying that I was dramatic that I was been such and such for trying to get my stuff out of the house. I had enough went to him and told him that we needed to talk, he refused to do it, and then started to get violent towards me (all of this in front of the flea market) I lost my patience and told him to stop saying those things about me, that I didn't understand why they were doing all of this if my partner was his family, the grandparents start talking sh**t about me and both the father and grandfather tried to hit me. My partner noticed the fight and came and started fighting also with his family, he told me to go somewhere else to calm down because I was really bad. They didn't want to let me take my things out, my partner almost had a physical fight with his father, at the end I could take my things out.

This was not the first time that we stopped talking to them for things like this one, we had to communicate again because I needed to work in the flea market and it was in front of the house. This was just so traumatic for my partner and I that we are broken, we are depressed and is affecting our lifes. I had nightmares and can't stop thinking about all of the things that happened. I want to get over it, and I don't have outside comfort or advice, I actually don't have anyone to talk about all of the things that happened to us, just my partner and I.

I just have been through a lot, I was in a really bad situation before this happened and all of this is just mentally stopping me from doing the things that I have to do  like  increasing my small business, finishing my social work and my thesis. I'm just trying to survive, sometimes I don't even have money to eat. We both have been trying to get a job, but where we are temporarily (small town) no one hire us, even the fabrics. All we have is my small business and is not going that great, I'm trying to do my best but I guess I have to wait for the good results at least that's what I hope for because I have been fighting to have a better life.",mentalhealth

1697513420.0,Any advice on arachnophobia?,"It's honestly pretty bad. I'm sort of okay with daddy long legs (I know they're not actually spiders, IDGAF, my brain sees a spider) because they just stay in their corner and don't move very fast. Ditto for orb weavers. If it's really, really tiny, like grain of rice tiny, I'm okay with that, too. 

 But it's goddamn giant house spider season, and I am seeing a legitimate decrease in my own functionality. It's worse this year than others, I think because there are just more of them (must be the weather or something - fall appeared early and hit pretty hard). I'd say there's a 70% chance I'll find one if I go in the laundry room for the past month. When I see one, I just immediately fall apart. I run away shrieking and can't even move until my husband kills it and disposes of the body. For like an hour+ afterwards, I'm all rattled and I lose my appetite. 

 It's been an issue since I was a little kid. It's a weird story, but I think it started when I had a terrible nightmare about a creepy house full of spiders when I was about five. If I try to get to the root of, it seems to have something to do with how unrelatable they are. They have no visible face, and all those legs, and they act like they're in their own little world (and omfg I hate them they're so creepy!). And, you know, they're in my house. I screamed my face off when a bird got in once, and I love birds. 

 What are some things I can do at home to cope with this? I'm starting to get fed up with these little bastards running my life. And I need to do laundry, damnit.

1697499723.0,Any of you depression heads have this as well? Or any insight?,"Ok, so, I am already diagnosed with a bunch of stuff (ADHD, MDD, GAD), so I know that I have many issues, I am currently taking various meds to help (Lamotragine, Buproprion, Vyvanse, and some multivitamins and they seem to help a little), and I am regularly seeing a psychiatrist, but I am still struggling very often.

The thing I am looking for advice about is this: During the day, basically every day and multiple times a day, I will go from feeling 'normal' and happy to completely depressed. When I am sitting at my desk I will feel happy and content for a bit, and then after an hour or two (sometimes more depending on what's going on) I feel very, very depressed (Complete lack of energy and enthusiasm to do anything, dwelling thoughts about past mistakes and current issues, that sort of thing). 

I have been smoking a lot of weed, which yes probably doesn't help, but this stuff was happening long before I started smoking, so I doubt that's the thing **causing** this. I am currently on a T break for 2 weeks, so I'll wait and see if that clears things up.

I think I mostly just want to know, do any of you guys get this stuff too? I hear about cycles of depression and bipolar and whatnot, but the stuff I hear is usually about longer term cycles over the course of months, but my mood can change very rapidly throughout the day. I don't really see stuff describing my specific situation, and I have been becoming increasingly frustrated that I can't figure out exactly what to do and I can't summon up the effort to do anything. 

So, do any of you have any insight? At this point, I'll take basically anything.",mentalhealth

1697512496.0,My mental health is catching up to me at uni,"I started at a pretty well ranked university a month ago and it was quite a snap decision, I had gotten lower A-level results than what I'd needed for my first choice uni. Originally my plan had been to take a gap year and retake if I didnt get the grades I needed however they were much lower than I was expecting and decided that I'd struggle more if I had to retake all 3 subjects in a year without teachers. 

  
Now im 3 hours and a ¬£60 train ticket away from home and 2 hours or more away from my close friends and I thought I was good at being independent through difficult times. Sixth form was not an easy time for me, I had a friendship group that did not treat me well at the beginning of year 12 that effected my confidence and my trust in people. I also lost my mother to an eating disorder and alcholism the day before I was meant to start year 13 and before that she'd been verbally abusive and dismissive of me. Despite this sixth form was ultimately a good experience I left with amazing friends and supportive teachers but I dont think I realised at the time they were what was helping me through all the mess around me and now I dont have them in my life in the same way. 

  
I've spent most of this month either in bed or out of the city im studying in, I've already been up to see my partner twice which is a 5 hour journey both ways as well as returning back home and visting friends in another city. Each time I've felt so much regret for where I chose to spend the next 3 years of my life and on top of that I feel regret for what I've chosen to study - at least in the way its taught at university.

  
I feel really lost as if I dont have a way forward or a way out, I dont trust myself to drop out and actually do something with my life there but I feel so trapped here. My accomodation at uni was also a shock in a lot of ways I now live with 16 other people in an old house on the edge of campus, its okay and I like my flatmates but its a lot of people, it makes me scared to leave my room even just to shower or go to the toilet, let alone eat or do my laundry so im using so much mental energy just to get basic tasks done which leaves me so low energy. I've also become semi nocturnal because of how bad my mental health has spiraled so I havent been attending lectures or really doing my studying either I just want to find something that makes me happy where I dont have to rely on other people to make me feel fulfilled. I want to feel confident and good at something again. ",mentalhealth

1697511297.0,"having trouble with (abrupt) breakdowns, looking for advice","for some time now my mental health has been doing a bit rocky, but as of quite recently its sort of taken a crash landing with some mild exploding here and there. in general, for several months now i've definitely felt depressed featuring a lack of interest and lack of motivations in most things i either need to do or just about all the things i used to love to do. 

as of the last few weeks though my brain has started to almost feels like its a scale. one end feels chill and like my usual, the middle balance feels completely apathetic and almost cruelly detached from my thoughts and my feelings with a ""but its whatever, get over it, anyway"" attitude, and the other end is like irrational crying-so-hard-it-hurts-toddler-tantrum-where-you-decide-no-one-likes-you-and-you-should-runaway with a sidekick of incredibly unwanted intrusive thoughts (go figure). the latter comes in the form of hour or more long breakdowns, sometimes triggered by incredibly small things and sometimes seemingly nothing, and afterwards i either snap out of it like it wasn't a big deal (??) or end up feeling empty and numb for anywhere from an hour to the following day. 

when it comes to the apathetic portion, there isn't much to say other than it just feels empty and i just go about my day - sometimes however, its also accompanied by this really weird disconnect to things i have quite literally done or memories i have and whatnot. like my brain will sometimes think of past things and start to feel a certain type of sadness and/or nostalgia and i feel like it wasn't me who experienced it and its like i'm some dude looking at my brain going ""man, sorry that happened to you :/""

I can tell for sure though when my mood starts to flip to the other end of the scale because it kind of feels like suddenly i do not want to talk or do what i was doing etc and my thoughts kind of flip from ""ooh when i get out of work maybe i'll get a burger :O"" to ""i will never thrive and i am doomed to a cycle i've created"" - which i can tell you in my current mindset is absolutely not how i actually feel and i don't know where that even came from but in those moments it definitely feels like the realest thing in the world. as a whole i can summarize it with i think and feel a lot of things that i know aren't true and/or i don't agree with when i'm not having a sudden outburst, some of them things i think are really mean to think or things i think just literally make no sense and can even be hypocritical, but that logic doesn't work in my mind during those times. 

to be honest, i don't think this is really brand new by any means, but its never been this bad. initially i was going to try to wait for it to pass or something but its starting to escalate and the part of me that doesn't tantrum and feel like the universe has abandoned me or whatever is getting pretty sick of this behavior, i will not lie >:/

i was kind of wondering a few things - for one, broadly, do you have any advice for anyways to go about handling this type of abrupt brain hell? (as well as things to maybe ease in or out of the breakdowns or at least comfort and self-care style things to do during that time.

I don't know how to describe it. Perhaps it's been the stress from being 15 and having to deal with school, I'm not sure. I know that it's probably normal and it might pass eventually, I just don't know how to deal with it right now. I don't want to upset anyone like my girlfriend for example.

1697510199.0,I'm losing my mind over a bathroom.,"I‚Äôm new here on reddit. I actually just joined after having a breakdown in my room. Sorry that it's long, I kinda didn‚Äôt realize how much I was holding in.  
  
My brother and I live together with my mom. I‚Äôm 21 and he is 23, it‚Äôs not ideal to live with our mom but we both have nowhere to go. And it doesn‚Äôt help that we both are jobless, so we‚Äôre just munching off my mom. I‚Äôm currently enrolled in community college after dropping out of high school, so most of my days are just me going to school, studying, and coming back home. It‚Äôs been a repetitive cycle of me going to school and coming back. I have no friends, I‚Äôm socially awkward, basically I feel alone and like shit on a daily basis.  
  
There are three bathrooms in my mom‚Äôs house. One in my mom‚Äôs room, one in the hallway next to both me and my brother‚Äôs room, and one downstairs the guest bathroom. Though the guest bathroom doesn‚Äôt have a bath or shower, it‚Äôs a half bathroom. Me and my brother use to share the bathroom upstairs next to our bedrooms, but I moved myself to the downstairs bathroom because I‚Äôm so sick and tired of my brother‚Äôs disgusting habits.   
  
When we shared a bathroom, my brother would always forget to wipe the toilet seat after using it. No, I don‚Äôt mean pee, I mean dirt. My brother has a habit of not showering so when I use the bathroom after him there are dirt stains on the toilet seat that I have to wipe up in order to use the toilet. Whenever he or pick his hair, he would leave his hair on the bathroom floor. If he took a big dump and it smelled, instead of leaving the bathroom door open to air out the bathroom (there isn‚Äôt a window in the bathroom), he would leave the door shut and when I go to use the bathroom as soon as I open the door I‚Äôm hit with the smell of ass. My brother basically eats the toilet paper, and as you know because of corona the price of toilet paper has skyrocketed and since we‚Äôre free loading off my mom we only get a select amount of toilet paper for both of us to use.   
  
Whenever the bathroom gets a little too dirty, I do my best to clean up the bathroom. I don‚Äôt want to use a dirty bathroom. The thing is my brother contributes to none of the cleaning when it comes to the bathroom. Every other month I clean the bathroom because I want to use a clean bathroom, and like a week after I cleaned the bathroom my brother somehow has found a way to make It dirty again in less than a week. So, after being fed up I decided to stop cleaning the bathroom, thinking that when it gets too dirty for my brother to use, he would decide to clean up the bathroom for once instead of waiting for me to do it. But after a while the bathroom was getting so nasty, I just had to clean it up out of pure disgust. I just cannot use a nasty bathroom like that even though my brother had no problem using the damn thing.   
  
And I wish I could tell my brother to get his shit together but I‚Äôm too scared to talk back to my brother. I‚Äôm too scared to put up a fight, so I let him walk over me every time. It‚Äôs a long story that would make this long story even longer, but long story short, my brother would always hit me when we were younger. My brother has a shit temper, he will get upset at the simplest things and instead of using his word he uses his fist. You should see his room, the number of holes in the wall‚Ä¶ anyway.    
  
After suffering in my room about this whole ordeal, I decided that I was going to start using the bathroom downstairs. So that we can have separate bathrooms and I won‚Äôt have to worry about my brother. And I had just recently cleaned the bathroom downstairs, so I was feeling good about the switch that I made. But even then, my brother would take the toilet paper that I was using because he ran out of his, even though I divide the toilet paper evenly between us. And recently, after I cleaned the downstairs bathroom, my brother has started to use the bathroom downstairs. Why? My guess is he doesn‚Äôt want to clean the bathroom upstairs. So now the problems I‚Äôve been having in the upstairs bathroom, is happening in the downstairs bathroom.  
  
I‚Äôm losing my mind right now, crying almost every night about this damn bathroom. All I want is a clean bathroom and for my brother to clean after himself. I don‚Äôt know what to do now, I‚Äôm stressing over toilet paper.

1697510072.0,Why is it so hard for me to function like a normal member of society,"
I‚Äôve been stuck in the same lazy, unmotivated pattern for as long as i can remember. I‚Äôm only 19 but i already feel so tired of life. For literally all my teenage years i‚Äôve felt this constant burnout, like i‚Äôm physically not strong enough to make anything out of myself. I‚Äôm always tired, always stressed out, always upset and mad, and i can‚Äôt remember the last time i felt energetic and not sleepy. 

I had to quit high school and i‚Äôm still taking classes online to graduate, got in a special program for people who struggle mentally. It was hard to get up, do everyday tasks and take care of myself when i was in school. So overwhelming, could barely stay awake through the day because of it all. But now that I only stay home, and don‚Äôt really have any reason to get out of bed i find it physically impossible to. I can barely go to the toilet because of how tiring it is. Haven‚Äôt brushed my teeth in so long, and i feel so disgusting at all times that it makes me feel even more drained than i already am.

 I‚Äôm too ashamed to admit i‚Äôm struggling and my family has always been so emotionally distant and busy with their lives. I‚Äôve already been a burden for so long, been bullied for years and in and out of therapy. The only support in my life right now is my mother but.. me and her aren‚Äôt exactly that close anymore. It‚Äôs complicated. Even though i live at home i barely speak with her, she seems tired of me everytime we talk and it makes me feel ashamed that i‚Äôm still living at home. Like she wants me to move out or something. I don‚Äôt really think she likes me.

 Idk where i‚Äôm going with this, but i just feel so hopeless. I feel like this is a neverending cycle and i eat so much crappy food that i actually feel my health declining lol. How do i get my energy back. I‚Äôm almost wondering if I have some underlying condition because of how exhausted i constantly am. Every little thing tips me over the edge and i handle small changes and stress so badly. Have to take several days to recover if anything out of the ordinary happens.

 I feel so far behind all of my former friends and the people in my life, and I have no interest in anything. Feels like i‚Äôm stuck but at the same time not really living anymore. Feels like everytime i wake up its a dream, because of how much i sleep. Confusing dreams with reality is a daily occurence now because of how much i sleep. What can i do?

I ended up doing to a residential treatment facility but I know that type of long-term care is different from what I was asking my psychiatrist.

1697496165.0,I feel like everything that brings me joy in life will inevitably be ruined.,"You know the concept of ""enshittification"" that Cory Doctorow talked about with websites and other services like that? It feels like that's happening all the time with everything - especially the things that bring me joy in the world. 

I'm a writer and I want to make a career out of it, but I don't know how when every possible publication is either on the verge of shutting down or about to turn into a meaningless content mill. I could be a professor somewhere, but I'll have to be an adjunct for years if I even get that far, because the entire world has been turned into a gig economy. The movie industry is in as precarious a place as it's ever been, especially movie theaters, which are one of my favorite places in the world. The internet has been shrunk to five sites that regurgitate content from one to the other. Everything's run by private equity firms that do nothing but suck the joy out f the world. AI could make things even worse, to say nothing of climate change. And I have no idea how any of this can be fixed.

I'm not in the mindset to sh right now, but I can imagine myself coming to that in the distant future. I have a girlfriend who I adore, but I don't want her to deal with all this shit, either. I don't know if I'm catastrophizing or if things are really that dire, but I just don't know what to do. I don't want this to be the rest of my life.",mentalhealth
1697509197.0,Do you think I should switch therapist?,"Hi, I hope you‚Äôre all doing great. Let me start by saying I‚Äôve been seeing a psychologist since february this year and we‚Äôd been doing ERP and in yesterday‚Äôs session she refused to do ERP because she said we needed to do what‚Äôs called ‚ÄúCognitive Restructuring‚Äù. However, she figured it out I tend to blame other people for my actions/and or for the things that happen to me instead of taking responsibility for it myself. She said I needed to change some negative thinking patterns and that there were many factors both internal and external that contributed and triggered my OCD, such as certain beliefs among other factors.

On the one hand, it was frustrating to hear that for now we are going to pause ERP, as I feel it‚Äôs essential. On the other hand, she also said the only thing ERP is going to do is desensitize me and that I needed some cognitive restructuring in order for it to be more effective. She said that if I really wanted to do ERP, she could refer me to another therapist, but for now we had to do some cognitive restructuring first before we continue with ERP.

I really need your advice, I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Do you think I should switch therapist?

I think that by any means ERP should be paused and tbh I don‚Äôt want to waste more time. I‚Äôm 31 years old and I just want to overcome OCD as soon/fast as possible.

In fact, I‚Äôve been struggling with OCD myself since my teen years and it ruined my twenties. Nowadays OCD is between mild and moderate according to her.

What should I do guys, I really need your advice.

Thanks in advance and have a good day.

1697495640.0,"I think I might be loosing my sanity, have a psychosis or mania or possibly all at once","Theres a laundry list of diagnoses I have had most of my life. Cptsd, dissociative disorder, autism, adhd and multiple phobias and general anxiety. Often enough I wonder if I might have bipolar disorder as well but I‚Äôve never spoken to a medical professional about that so far. 

I have no idea how long a psychosis can last and I truly can‚Äôt differentiate what might be signs of a psychosis and what might just be symptoms of my other disorders. 

My brain just constantly feels muddy and I can feel myself slipping. Slipping with the extremity of my emotions, slipping with my touch to reality, slipping with my general thought patterns. 

I can‚Äôt really remember a time that I didn‚Äôt have this sense of slipping though, probably had it for 8-10 years now. A lot of it is probably also due to my dissociative disorder, there‚Äôs times where I can‚Äôt see or speak properly, times where I can‚Äôt walk properly, times where I loose all sensation in my body, times where I can‚Äôt hear properly. Ever since I was young I‚Äôve always had a haunting sensation of someone being in my house that has lasted to this day, ever since I was little I also kept seeing shadows of a figure or a silhouette always just barely outside of my field of vision. I have phases with extreme happiness, irrational spending habits or extreme depression. 

Every single day the past 5+ years or so I have desired to harm myself. It‚Äôs the only thing that gives me peace of mind and the only thing that makes me focused enough to be productive. Over the past years I have developed less destructive, harmful and more sustainable ways to do that. Not because I really care for sustainability but because I really don‚Äôt want to deal with questions from family members or people surrounding me. 

I am completely out of touch with reality, everything just feels like I‚Äôm in some sort of dream state. 

I‚Äôve been in therapy for years and it never did anything. After a year long break I‚Äôm now back at looking for a therapist and psychiatrist since I want to try out if there‚Äôs possibly some improvement when therapy is supported by medication. 

I was on schizophrenia meds before when I spent half a year in a mental hospital but I truly never felt like they did anything apart from making me feel drowsy.",mentalhealth

1697508888.0,What causes someone to feel like they can't be loved/liked if they make a mistake?," Most of the time when I make a mistake it causes me to feel unlovable/unlikeable for a while (which in the moment feels like it's gonna be for the rest of my life lol). Like for example, if my mom gets upset at me for something I did I always end up feeling like she'll never love me again or that I can't/shouldn't be loved because I'm some sort of terrible person or not good enough and it throws me in a loop for at least a night. If I get one bad grade (that isn't even that bad) on an assignment in school after getting multiple high grades in a row I'll feel like the teacher lost all faith in me and then be embarrassed to pass anything in after that and/or start slacking off. If I notice a friend talks to someone differently than they do with me, the second I'm alone my mind will immediately go ""do they even actually like me?"" ""do I have it all wrong?"" ""do they feel like I'm forcing them to talk to me?"" and other questions along those lines. I constantly question if I'm actually good enough for my friends and the people around me or if they secretly make fun of me behind my back. I also don't believe I could be loved in a romantic way at all. I just don't see how something like that could be possible for me, not for any particular emotional reason either. I have a lot of love to give but I feel like I'm just incapable of receiving it for like no reason. Not built for it ig. I literally cannot fathom that idea without feeling paranoid. I know that if someone did, I'd be waiting for them to give up on me and leave for whatever reason they have. I don't feel like any connection I have with anyone can be something permanent and that I'll just end up hurt in the long run.

&#x200B;

When I was a kid, every single one of my best friends (and I didn't have a lot of friends because I was shy) would move away.  My dad also was emotionally absent while semi-physically absent. Eventually he left and became comepletely absent. My mother is extremely avoidant when it comes to emotions or conflict or anything that can be slightly percieved as a problem, and usually just resorts to saying ""whatever"", ""nevermind"", being in denial, walking away, avoiding accountability depending on what it is, going and taking a nap/going to bed, or telling me to fuck off. She isn't the best at communicating. I still love her even when I feel like she doesn't love me, and I understand we're all just products of our environment. Once I became a teen, around 12-15 I was friends with people who were extremely toxic because at the time I was easily manipulated and an EXTREME people pleaser, while also being toxic myself. I ended up cutting them off (it was really rough, for a while I kept going back lol) Also at 13, I had a friend who decided to start really intense arguments out of nowhere, try to push me away, and also had me thinking they were going to kts for a good couple of months and made me pull multiple all-nighters. The stress was so intense that I got physically sick at one point. They would never hang out with me or talk to me in school but then I'd see them go and hang out with their friends. Sometimes they'd cancel on me to make plans with other people. Finally let them go after a while, but I was really in the dark with what happened so I thought about them a lot. Two years later they texted me one day and we became friends again. Lo and behold it goes to shit and I cut them off because they were a horrible friend once again. I did that a few months ago. There's only one friend that I've been able to keep but even then she has moved since. She's still my best friend though and we talk a lot every day over the phone. Growing up, I was extremely shy, and early into my teens it was full blown anxiety. I'm getting over that now.

&#x200B;

Those are the only things I can think of, along with other things I will not type but Idk wtf is wrong with me dude. I constantly feel like everything is on the line all of the time, that all my relationships with everyone are more fragile than everyone elses, and I feel like my brain is hiding so much stuff that could explain the way I feel. These feelings affect every single aspect of my day no matter how big or small. I don't believe I have childhood trauma but my family is ... dysfunctional to say the least.

&#x200B;

What are some examples of things that could cause someone to start thinking of themself this way and feel this way?

&#x200B;

I'd also like to note that I don't take these feelings out on other people as it is not their fault. I have no problem with people setting boundaries with me and vice versa. I also have no qualms about leaving people who are not good for me, though it does take a while as I can convince myself that I'm the problem and at fault for every single thing pretty easily still. I know on a logical level that these feelings aren't completely rational, it's just my emotions and that hurt part of me that doesn't.",mentalhealth

1697508041.0,Emotionally abusive/manipulative ex reached out a year after break up,"So I broke up with my boyfriend around a year ago. It was the best decision I made but it took me way too long to do it. I don't think I even wanted to date him at all, but I caught feelings somewhere (I slept with him and I was a virgin) and just got along with it ignoring all red flags. Eventually I just couraged myself up and stood firm on my decision. We separated. We dated for almost 1.5 years. 

The last time he tried to reach out was late may or early june, so 5+ months ago. Before that he reacted out almost every month. I ignored all of that but this one. I decided to reply this time and he kept thanking me for that, telling me stuff like 'i dreamt of you 3 times this night' 'you can always count on me' and told me he wants nothing from me but 'message me at times and ask how I am' and asked how my family is doing. It was clearly his attempt at slowly getting me back by getting me to talk to him first. So I said that nah, don't msg me again I only replied out of politeness and to tell you you just should move on. Then I blocked him.

But part of me keeps wondering, why did he reach out at all? Call me a skeptic but I don't believe he 'loves me'. Yeah I know he suffered, and clearly suffers now, but I feel like it's not because of me, it's because of him. *He* lost a free emotional support, a free sex on demand, a free maid and a cook, a girl 10 years younger who looked 14-15 like he preferred, a good girlfriend who put up with his shit and never demanded anything in return, not even cheap gifts or even basic respect, and with all that, a tall slim 8/10 virgin, god damn not all men are lucky like that, even attractive, wealthy and good men, let alone trash like him. I feel like he only messaged me because he could not get anyone else, esp someone like me. I'm pretty sure if a 13 year old looking 18 year old girl will agree to date his 32 hear old ass he will very quickly forget I existed.

'i still love you' my ass. Translation: I can't find another fool like you and I want to fuck/I'm lonely. Please believe my sweet words again and come back to me and help me get rid of my loneliness. I'm old and I need a son asap but no one wants to birth me kids because I live in a trash 1 room trailer park.

But another part of me is solaced/pleased/happy he didn't forget me. I feel better knowing he realizes he valued me. He was an a$hole but it would be much worse if he just used me and never even cared I was not there anymore. I still think of him often but it's mostly anger and regret I gave him a chance. And yeah, I do miss him a bit at times, some sweet moments hence why I care to type it all :) yes I'm happy he messaged, and not even as a 'gotcha' petty moment, no... More like, I gave all myself and got trashed up in return but it could be worse and he could just never remember me at all. Kinda like that.

I‚Äôm going to put it into a few different subs and my punctuation might be a little spotty so I apologise for that. I‚Äôm a 21 (almost 22) year old male and I live in the UK. Im not really sure what I‚Äôm looking for posting this on Reddit, I‚Äôm not looking for someone to have a magic solution to all my life‚Äôs problems, I was going to write  all this into a journal or something but I‚Äôve scoured my house for a pen and I can‚Äôt find one.

I‚Äôve suffered with anxiety my entire life as long as I can remember, I was always an anxious child, mainly health anxiety. Over the last 10 or so years I‚Äôve convinced myself that I have almost every sinister disease and ailment that exists at some point. From heart attacks, brain tumours, testicular cancer (and basically every other cancer) to even small marks on my skin that I‚Äôll see and convince myself I‚Äôve been bitten by a deadly spider or something. I can‚Äôt remember how or why but at some point my health anxiety developed into agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations that are hard to escape if you were to have a panic attack or an anxious episode of some sorts (I think).  I first noticed this when I was 15 doing my GCSE mock exams, we would do our exams in a big sports hall with small tables dotted around it, this never usually bothered but one occasion I had a panic attack during an exam. I asked my exam invigilator if I could leave to go to the toilet and I was told no. My panic attacks were always quite subtle if you didn‚Äôt know I was having one, I wouldn‚Äôt be hyperventilating or passing out like you see in films rather I‚Äôd be sat there with thoughts racing through my mind, my hands getting clammy, my vision becoming blurry, my senses suddenly becoming more pronounced (especially my hearing) & getting the feeling I was in a dream, that my hands or feet weren‚Äôt mine & that I was watching myself in 3rd person. I‚Äôve since learned this is called derealisation and it‚Äôs a response to extreme panic.  

After this I started experiencing these panic attacks and episodes of derealisation more frequently in school. It got to the point where one day I went home and told my parents that I was never going back to school again & I didn‚Äôt. I left school in 2017 , a year before I was supposed to leave . I went through home schooling for my final year,  completed my exams at community centre & left school with 3 GCSEs. Initially I was relieved, it was great not having to go to school and face my anxieties and sleeping in until whatever time I pleased, I answered to nobody lol.

Flash forward 6 years and Im still at home, sleeping in till whatever time I please & answering to nobody only this time it‚Äôs not so great. I was kicked out of college, I‚Äôve been fired from or left 4 jobs & not even turned up to interviews for another 10 or so. Im 21, unemployed with no prospects or qualifications, I‚Äôm losing friends constantly, I‚Äôm an alcoholic and I never leave my house because If I go further than 20 minutes away I have a panic attack. My friends are outgrowing me and dropping like flies, my family are getting increasingly frustrated with me although my parents are incredibly supportive and understanding. Just this year a friend who has always been by my side stopped talking to me after I flaked on a plan we made to go on a hike on the mountain (which is one of my panic attack triggers) & despite my efforts to reach out and sort things I‚Äôve been ignored for going on 7 months now. Every day for me is the same, sometimes I get a jolt of motivation where I plan to start MMA and get a job and get my life in order but I suffer so much with social anxiety and low confidence  that I end up flaking on those too, I can‚Äôt go on holidays or to festivals with my friends because I‚Äôm scared to fly and I‚Äôm scared of motorways, the only things I really look forward to is whatever UFC event is on that weekend. I‚Äôm a fairly good looking lad and I‚Äôve always had attention off girls but I can‚Äôt get a girlfriend because although I have a licence I‚Äôm scared to drive my car & I have no money to take them anywhere and have any kind of normal relationship with them so it always ends up being a 3 month thing until they get bored of me & I always end up with my heartbroken drinking more and more to get rid of the pain. I‚Äôve had private counselling which I didn‚Äôt feel like was helping me at all because the lady doing it wasn‚Äôt understanding what I was telling her, I‚Äôve been on multiple SSRIS (currently 100mg sertraline) and I‚Äôve felt no relief from any of them, in fact I‚Äôve become more depressed on them. It‚Äôs something  i hate to say but I feel like if I didn‚Äôt have anxiety around my health and I wasn‚Äôt scared of death that I‚Äôd have killed my self a long time ago. Just so lost and I don‚Äôt know where to start. Sometimes I just want someone or something to come along and give me a glimmer of hope but nothing seems to go my way,  life just seems to keep kicking me down.

1697505975.0,how can i know if i'm being gaslighted by my family or if i'm genuinely overreacting?,"first let's be honest and recognize that people often exaggerate their feelings and overreact to stuff, so please don't come to me saying ""your feelings are always valid"". no, we should be able to question when our feelings are genuinely bigger than the situation, and it's healthy to identify that in order to heal and grow.

with that being said, i don't know if my family is gaslighting me or if i'm just exaggerating everything that's happening. they make me feel miserable constantly. idk if i was emotionally abused or not as a child because idk if it was really that deep or not. although i think it's deeply affected me in my adulthood. 

i've tried to talk to them about this, the things they've done and how they make me feel but they always shut me down or tell me i'm just playing the victim. one of my relatives then started to apologize to me after i had a suicide attempt and said they were so sorry for everything they had done and how much harm they cause me but it felt ingenuine and manipulative. 

i'm constantly asking myself if maybe my feelings about my family are just an overreaction of mine, given specially that they've failed to recognize them. 

i also feel like i'm constantly walking over eggshells in fear i might say something wrong and they misinterpret it and an argument gets started.

i know i'm being pretty vague here, my apologies for that, i think i'm holding myself back from saying some things out of fear of victimizing myself and taking a place that isn't mine ",mentalhealth

And the last example that happened to me approximately 2 months ago was that I was with 2 of my closest friends drinking beer and it was late and I had to leave, and I asked them if I would buy one more round of beers to which they said yes, but No one took their beer and they kept it for themselves, I only took it. In the end I got angry because I felt that they made fun of me by not drinking their beers and being the only one who drank it, and I argued with them telling them that and also on several occasions that I was the one who had the initiative to get together and in the end they left me standing . This is causing discomfort to my girlfriend because he sees that I think that people do things and make fun of me.

1697503639.0,Do I have depression?,"First, I know it's not healthy to ask this on Reddit. The best course is to go to a professional and seek help or talk to a close friend. But I'll give you two contexts below so you would understand why I have to say it here.

Context 1: From where I'm from, mental health issues are easily dismissed by people as ""just acting out, being too emotional, etc."" And while we're slowly breaking the stigma here, some of my family and friends still subscribe to that old narrative and would even tell me to ""just pray."" 

Context 2: Aside from people who dismiss me, those who do understand have a lot on their plate right now and I don't want to burden them. Even my girlfriend is busy and stressed with work, though she listens to me when we have the chance to talk.

**So here we go...**

I was laid off from work last mid-July. It came out of the blue. I didn't expect it because even if I was a freelancer, I usually have this gut feeling whenever the project is going south. Most of the time, when I feel like things are slowing down, I look for other projects to fill that gap. This one I didn't see coming.

As a freelancer, I always communicate with my clients, especially with my performance and what I need to improve. It's like my quarterly review/check because even if the editors don't have any problem with my writing, I still want to know if there's any way I can improve. I was doing a great job with my work, my editors loved my work ethics, and I got perfect ratings during performance reviews.

I also asked our Managing Editor about the status of the company whenever we got in touch just to gauge how long the project would still go on. Two weeks before I got laid off, she said everything was going well.

So when they sent the email that they had to let me and other writers go, I was in shock. I wasn't prepared for it. It was only a week's notice, but that's fair since I was only a freelancer. (Mind you, I have had previous projects that the client just deserted out of the blue.)

Between then and now, I only had two projects which were really cut short. I don't think it's about my work. I think it's about cutting the cost, especially when they have a VA who knows how to use ChatGPT and other AI tools.

I kept applying for jobs on most job boards I knew. I usually don't want to commit to a full-time job since I want to open myself to more projects and possibilities, but I reached desperation and applied to a full-time job, even those that would mean I need to migrate. 

It's been 3 months since I had no work, and it's already making me more anxious than I used to. My savings are running low. Jobs aren't easy to come by. Bills are piling up. My mental health is declining by the day.

It comes and goes. There are days that I feel nervous whenever I can't find a job to apply to in a day. I get anxious at every email I receive, only to feel down when I see a rejection. I stare blankly at anything for most hours of the day. I cry often, and there's this heavy feeling in my chest.

I know you can't and are not allowed to diagnose me, but I just need a push in the right direction. And even if I am depressed, I don't think I can afford professional help with my financial state right now.",mentalhealth

I am currently diagnosed schizophrenia, I'm medicated, on therapy, and everything else for more than five years now. I have had the same psychiatrist for a while, but every single therapist in my country denies diagnosis of any sort. A friend of mine was told she didn't have depression despite showing obvious signs. I lost her to suicide. She was never diagnosed, never went to therapy. It's horrible.

Now, I was telling my psychiatrist how I thought I may have ADHD to some point. It's driving me crazy, and it's been present since I was a child. It's recently taken a toll on me because of university, I cannot for the life of me focus during class. I have no idea what the teacher is talking about 90% of the time. I try to turn off my phone but I need to constantly take breaks and get out of class to breathe because I cannot stay focused. Studying at home drives me crazy, I always end up studying things 3 hours before my exams which, as a bio major, is \*not\* a good idea. You can imagine what some of my grades are.

I recently had a talk with a friend over this, because she complained I didn't do any work (I do, I just do it right before the deadline which drives her crazy and she ends up doing it herself) and there are things she just won't trust me with anymore so she hands over the work with my name on it despite me not doing anything. I seriously whole-heartedly believe she thinks I'm stupid. Honestly I believe I'm stupid as well. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I'm about to drop out of uni, I love my career but I'm just not fit for it. I don't know what else to do in life.

I talked about this with my psychiatrist and she said it was ""normal"" and to just ""try to focus more"" which is nuts to me because I swear I do what I can. I don't even care about medication anymore, I just need to know if I'm going too crazy over this and I'm just stupid or if something is actually wrong. What the hell.

1697501892.0,Ups and downs with my mental health,"!!! Content-Note: Suicidal Ideations, self-harm, unhealthy relationships, abuse. !!!

For the record: I‚Äôve been struggling with my mental health for a long time now (started in 7th grade or sth) . Some months more, some less. In the last few months I‚Äôve really dabbled with the thought of having BPD/EUPD aka emotional instability disorder. 
Whoever is familiar with this disorder or has any form of knowledge for this topic, please leave your thoughts below, thank you :)
In the following text I‚Äôll only list things that I think are relevant for this disorder: 

-chaotic childhood: my dad was working around 80% of the time in my childhood/youth and my mom was home. We fought a lot bc I was a pathetic liar. We had many fights. I experienced emotional and sometimes physical abuse. 

-unstable relationships: got into ‚Äúromantic‚Äù relationships in 6th grade already. It wasn‚Äôt romantic, it was pure chaos instead, we fought a lot for 12 year olds (in most cases because of her eating disorder). Had several friendships which never lasted longer than 2 years. My last intense friendship ended with both of us threatening to report each other to the authorities for several reasons. Our friendship was the best and worst I‚Äôve ever had. But the friendship itself was a rolercoaster. He threatened to kll himself several times, so did I. He was abusing drugs so much. He was fucked up. We weren‚Äôt good for each other. 

Self-image: idk what to say ab this lol

Unstable emotions/impulsivity/anger: my boyfriend says that I am the most unpredictable persons he knows. I recognize my emotions being mixed up pretty often and sometimes pretty heavily. I try my best not to show the anger I am feeling sometimes. But my emotions are immersive if I don‚Äôt beam myself out (idk how to say it better)

suicidality/self-harm: been admitted to a closed psych ward bc I was suicidal after my friendship almost ended (the person mentioned earlier). I abused alc several times to ‚Äúregulate‚Äù myself. 
In certain situations if I get really angry at myself for example I self-harm. I think about suicide at least once a week if I‚Äôd have a to give a number. 


Fear of abandonment: I don‚Äôt think I have to say anything to this anymore haha. I do absurd and unethical stuff to not get left.  


Feeling detached from reality: it happens way too often. I don‚Äôt remember certain months of this year. I‚Äôm just so spaced out sometimes. After one fight with my boyfriend I was so out of this world I went outside (~2 degrees Celsius) and I didn‚Äôt feel it.  I felt my body shivering but mentally I just wasn‚Äôt there. 


I can give more details if needed. Even in German bc it‚Äôs my mother tongue.

1697501208.0,My fiance is unemployed and depressed,"My (34F) fiance (37m) is currently unemployed and has been for about 6months.  We have applied for unemployment benefits and they have been exhausted.

He has been very depressed and frequently tells me that he wants to give up and that he's tired of life.  He hasn't made any suicide attempts or harmed himself, but I work from home so I make sure he's in the room with me whenever he's awake.  Based on what I see and my own experience, I just don't think he needs to be hospitalized for how he feels at this time.

He was a very hard worker, responsible, and generally happier when he was employed, and I know he has it in him to get back to being himself again.

I try to encourage him by letting him know that he's loved by me and his family.  I compliment him about something every day (ie he's handsome, he's muscular, strong, manly, etc).  He still works around the apartment, like cleaning or fixing something simple or fixing something with my car whenever I ask him to, and I always praise and thank him whenever he gets something done.

I look out for any kind of job that I know he'd do well, but whenever I show it to him or encourage him to apply to it, he gets very agitated and angry.  He'll also get depressed when I tell him that we don't have enough money for something (either bills or food) or whenever I talk about how we're struggling financially.  He also stays up till morning and will sleep until 3 or 4pm.  (He says it's because that's when his friends are online to play).

I'm becoming even more concerned now because he's lost the motivation to apply for more jobs, and I suspect he hasn't applied to anything within the last couple weeks.  I brought this up to him and he got angry.

To compound the issue, he refuses to go to therapy or a psychiatrist.  I have suggested it many times and he will get angry every time.

At this point it seems that he gets angry whenever I push him to do anything unless it's to fix or clean something.
I would like to make it clear that I am not leaving him.  He has made big sacrifices to be with me.  He loves his family very much, but he still moved to a state 20 hours away to help me take care of my parents who are ill.  He's also sold some of his very valuable belongings to help us stay afloat (gaming laptop, tablet, etc).

I also have no intention of getting him to stop playing games online.  They're the only friends he has and it's the only time I get to hear him laugh or see him smile.  It's the only thing he enjoys now.  Playing online is also how we first met, which I'm very proud of, despite how others might think.

I am hoping to get some advice on ways to keep his spirits up and getting him motivated to apply for jobs again.  He's always been a bit grumpy and moody, but he's a sweet and kind person who is in tune with how I feel, and he absolutely deserves to be happy and loved.

1697501130.0,Phobia of drugs and alcohol consumes my thoughts daily and I feel powerless to stop it,"I'm a 26 year old male with autism/asperger's, clinical depression and anxiety (treating with zoloft.) I've had a multitude of mental issues and false thoughts that thankfully I've been able to work through and change my thinking with therapy. But there's been an ongoing thought pattern that I've been struggling with for years now and I'm starting to fear will never get better.

I've traced it back to my middle school and high school years and the health classes I took with my peers at the time. When those classes would do units on alcohol and illegal drugs, they would understandably have a negative perspective- not a hardline ""Just say no""/D.A.R.E. approach but firmly opposing any drug use including marijuana, and irresponsible drinking. I took the warnings of negative health effects and addiction so seriously that at that time, I promised to myself I would never even try alcohol, weed, etc. even once. I felt content with this until I was 17/18 and my fellow seniors were becoming more openly vocal around me about experimenting with booze and weed, while I was in SADD and helping promote drug and alcohol abstinence- and it completely broke me. How could my peers have sat through the same classes as me and made the choice *not* to heed those warnings? Especially the Honors students I had classes with and felt the most kinship with- even they were becoming open to it? It would have been one thing if I was opposed to just irresponsible use- but I was so dismayed I became completely philosophically opposed to *any* amount of alcohol consumption or usage of non-pharmaceutical drugs including weed.

I felt so confused, frustrated, stupid, and alone, and it's only become worse as I've gotten older and my eyes have become fully open to how common drinking is in American culture and elsewhere, and recreational marijuana use becomes more and more publicly and politically acceptable. I've tried everything to dispel my fear and the thoughts I kmow are illogical. Therapy, thought exercises, I even broke my vow and began (occasionally) drinking over thw past few months in the hope that facing my fear would dispel it. But I just cannot get out of the rut no matter what. My thoughts race nightly with anxiety and anger at the legality and commonality of alcohol and now marijuana. Fantasizing and wishing that society would lose all interest in intoxicating substances, embrace sober thinking and good health, and make marijuana and alcohol illegal- and only making myself more depressed because I know this fantasy will never happen. Having to keep all these thoughts bottled up because I want to be a progressive, liberal, open minded person and don't want to be ostracized for my fear of alcohol and weed and drugs. Judging people for using them, knowing I'm being too judgemental, and hating myself for it. I just want it all to stop and not occupy my thoughts every single late night and early morning and just treat these substances like a normal fucking person.

I apologize for the word vomit, I just need to get that all off my chest/out of my head. People of /r/mentalhealth, can you offer me any advice on how to conquer this phobia and this negative thought spiral? Thank you in advance.",mentalhealth

1697478125.0,There might be a very good reason behind my ongoing depression,"Hi folks, i was just thinking that my ongoing depression doesn't seem to be improving very much despite cbt therapy and antidepressant. 
I believe that the reason is we don't live in a world atm where we have a lot of reasons to be happy. 
Those in work being kept on the level by the daily grind, but overall the state we find ourselves in, is quite depressing,  and we haven't even talked about the everyday problems on top of that. Or the old traumas and unresolved personal issues.
Looking at this, im not surprised at all that mental health services appear to be overwhelmed and a lot of people who are self aware and can have access to their emotions are feeling low and unmotivated. There isn't much to look forward to when it comes to the future of humanity. I do hope that we will improve,  but im losing hope of a better future. 
Everyday entertainment and distractions help a little to tolerate it, but i for one am far from happy or hopeful.",mentalhealth

1697499014.0,How do you deal with uncertainty in friendships?,"TL;DR: How do you know your friends want to spend time with you if they don‚Äôt usually initiate interaction.

This is more so regarding those closer friendships that you have a higher emotional investment in. For instance, I have friends where I‚Äôm currently at that I enjoy seeing and occasionally spend time with, but I don‚Äôt go to them with personal issues and I‚Äôm not exactly looking for ways to spend time with them most of the time (mostly because of lack of common interests and stage of life). However, for those closer friends that you specifically want to spend time with and grow those relationships, how do you tell if they want to spend time with you? In my case, I have a couple friends that I know love me to bits, but they‚Äôre usually too busy to do much other than call maybe twice a month, but I have some other friends elsewhere that I know enjoy having me around when I go to visit, but I don‚Äôt really get to talk to them and I usually can‚Äôt get them online to play games. I‚Äôd like to spend more time with them, but if I approach it directly, even if they agree, that doesn‚Äôt answer of the question of if they actually want to grow that friendship (or if they‚Äôre just doing something because you asked), but if I do nothing, I‚Äôm just sitting here with almost no human interaction besides work.

1697496194.0,"Struggling with a lot of things , but I‚Äôm too scared to reach out and ask for help.","This is a throwaway, cause I believe my ex browses Reddit sometimes

I [21M] have been struggling recently with a lot of things in my life recently , to make a long story short , in 2020 I was dating a girl for a year and a half , abruptly in May of 2020, she cheated on me and left me one of her coworkers for a short fling. This drained me mentally , while also going into my first year of University , and losing out on my senior prom and graduation. I never had a support structure to reach out on during this time , so I struggled to keep it all inside and just faked a smile to everyone I knew, my friends , family , and even more recent partners . But deep down I knew that I wasn‚Äôt mentally sound or okay, but I‚Äôm still scared of truly opening up to anyone. 

Skip ahead to the end of 2021, and I started to truly feel better in a mental sense , and I met a girl(ex) [19f]. I had never truly felt happier then when I spent time with her, but at the same time I was hesitant to truly let myself open up and spend quality time with her. I had lied to my parents to go out , and would sneak out and meet her  and that‚Äôs how we would spend time together , for the first couple months this was the main way we hung out , and I admit it wasn‚Äôt the best or smartest way to go about meeting someone. 

But after a couple more months , I had made a mistake and forgot to delete a dating app, which was shown in a screenshot of my homescreen while we were looking at my camera roll, this spun a huge argument and accusations of cheating , which I tried and tried to state that I had not done anything , but it was not ending well for me one way or another.

This was my fault and I wholeheartedly acknowledge that it was a mistake and that I deserve any punishment that I had gotten. But after a week of time apart to think about the relationship, we needed up giving it another try, but this time with limitations and things , like location sharing apps, passwords, etc. At this point , I really tried to make things better , in terms of the commitment and openness because i believed this was my last chance to make things right.

Going into the fall season, things started to look good for the relationship , my parents and family met her, I met her family and we hung out constantly. I was finally in a better place mentally and I gave my love and appreciation constantly. But towards the beginning of November this became distant overnight. Suddenly she was going out with friends on late night drives multiple times a week, there would be less phone calls and late night FaceTimes.  It got to the point where we didn‚Äôt even spend time together on thanksgiving. 

Towards the beginning of December , things got to a point where there just wasn‚Äôt a relationship anymore and so I brought it up. And at the end of the day it was a difficult decision for both of us that we shouldn‚Äôt continue. 

I tried to clear my mind and mentally reset , as I was in a better place from where I had been a couple years prior. So I had downloaded a dating app again to get my confidence back up , and I saw her. She was one of the first people that popped up, so I quickly blocked her on the app so she wouldn‚Äôt see me on it, then promptly deleted my account and deleted the app. This was the moment my mental health shattered.

For the first couple months of the year, we had texted once or twice a month, sometimes non at all, till at one point she had asked me to hangout and just catch up, so I accepted and we spent the afternoon just talking over dinner and seeing how eachother have been. Before leaving we talked about the breakup and how everything ended and she asked in a normal tone
 ‚ÄúDo you remember M from when we met? Well he started texting me again in October.‚Äù

For context, M was a friend of my ex‚Äôs that played the good guy role, and he stalked my social media, and constantly told my ex that I was a bad person, and that he was the one for her because he was really nice. So we talked about it before things got really serious and I told her I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with her talking to him anymore , and so she agreed and blocked him on everything , and at this point he blew a fuse and tried to meet her at her work, and kept on claiming that he would treat her right and that I wasn‚Äôt good enough.

So hearing that this guy was texting her again before we broke up, it started blowing up my anxieties again. I started thinking about the times where her location had randomly turned off, and the excuse was that the app had glitched, and my mental health took a dive.

At the time, I didn‚Äôt think much of it, and we talked for about more frequently. Then abruptly she ghosted me for a couple weeks, after two weeks of nothing I asked if there was any point in me trying, and she said that we should just move on.

For the month following that , I had looked at her social media and had seen that she had updated her profile pictures to some where it was her and M. And now all I feel is dread inside.

She seems happily in a relationship with someone who made me uncomfortable, and I keep hurting myself by looking at the pictures. 

How can I move on? How can I find peace knowing that I may have been cheated on ? It‚Äôs been months and I‚Äôm still in a rut, what can I do to save my own mental health?

TLDR: Past relationship issues caused problems early on in new relationship , solved issues then started overthinking when past issues came up in new relationship, now I‚Äôm stuck and drowning mentally and have no one to reach out too for help. What can I do?",mentalhealth

1697494989.0,TW: talk about suicide. One of my best friends keeps hinting at committing and i don‚Äôt know what to do.,"I have no idea if this is allowed here or if I need to put a trigger warning, but I‚Äôm honestly so lost right now and don‚Äôt know what to do so this is my best bet. I‚Äôm also using a throwaway account. 

So I‚Äôm 14 years old and I have an online best friend who‚Äôs 12, almost 13 who we‚Äôll call K.
Me and K have known each other for about 3 or 4 years now and speak via instagram. About a year ago now K opened up to me about his mental health and trauma. Absolutely terrible stuff that I won‚Äôt get into here. I was the first person he ever told and I can see why, as when he finally DID tell his parents they dismissed everything. I honestly felt sick to my stomach when I heard that they just acted like what happened to him was ok. He‚Äôs also asked for a therapist but they refuse to give him one. He‚Äôs told the school counselor and they‚Äôve done nothing. 

So fast forward to now. 
One thing you need to know about K is he communicates through the music he listens to, which is difficult for me as i don‚Äôt listen to most of the stuff he does. He usually puts songs up in his notes on instagram. (in case you don‚Äôt know notes is a feature on ig where if two people follow each other, in DMs you can see these little messages they type out. You can add music and people can reply to them and whatnot)
And here is where I introduce my other friend, J. I‚Äôve known her for as long as i have K. We‚Äôre a trio. 
Now I never see K‚Äôs notes on ig. They never pop up for me. But J does. 
J will tell me if K puts something worrysome in his notes. 
But I usually can tell when something‚Äôs off with K because he types funny when he‚Äôs not in a good mood or tired or even feeling suicidal. He‚Äôll say ‚Äúlol‚Äù instead of laughing how we usually laugh in text. 
A few days ago K had done just that and I asked ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù He said ‚Äúidek‚Äù i pushed to get more out of him and he just said he was having a good day until he got home and it was probably just depression. 
Then J shoots me a dm saying K had told her he was thinking about committing. 
I of course freaked out. But I didn‚Äôt say anything to K about it. 
Since then K has been putting stuff in his notes about looking up how to tie a noose, saying ‚Äúwhat the f**k is wrong with me?‚Äù Along with the song ‚Äúdon‚Äôt try suicide‚Äù by queen. 
Me and J have been talking about mailing K some gifts to cheer him up but we haven‚Äôt got around to it yet. 
But today, things have gotten worse. In just a span of 2 hours I‚Äôve had to ask him if he‚Äôs ok twice because he keeps saying things that are setting off alarms in my head and he keeps avoiding the question. 
First he put a song titled ‚Äúi deserve to bleed‚Äù in his notes. I‚Äôve never heard the whole song but I recall portions of it from online. I asked him if he‚Äôs ok he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs homework. Totally.‚Äù I asked him if he needs to talk and said if he does need to I‚Äôm here. I always tell him I‚Äôm here if he needs to talk. He said ‚Äúno :3‚Äù
Then he sent me a video of someone talking about jokingly looking up how to tie a noose on their school laptop. And he said ‚Äúima do it‚Äù
I may just be crazy but that set off alarms. I responded with ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know if I should be worried or not.‚Äù He said ‚Äú>X3‚Äù

I‚Äôm honestly so worried. I don‚Äôt know what I can do to help him because we live hours away. 
I know this is kind of shitty and selfish of me to bring up, but this is also affecting me and my own mental health deeply. I‚Äôve been depressed recently and for a while I was having my own messed up thoughts due to a broken ankle. But I‚Äôm in a slightly better space now thanks to not being in agonizing physical pain 24/7
But I just can‚Äôt fill from an empty cup. I‚Äôm trying my best to do everything i can to help him but I‚Äôm out of ideas. And I can‚Äôt even help myself on top of that. 

I‚Äôm just worried and upset. Is there something i can do to help him? I know I can get a welfare check done on him if I think he‚Äôs gonna actually commit, but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm just out of ideas and energy.",mentalhealth

My ""ex"" (if you would even count it as a relationship ‚Äî it lasted 1 month 2 years ago) won't stop trying to text and talk to me. Last year, I told him to leave me alone about 5 times, and I thought he finally did when he stopped texting me for a few months. But a few days ago he sent me about 50 audio messages apologizing for everything he did wrong in our relationship and asked if we could be friends again. I thought he sounded sincere, so I accepted his apology but said no to being friends. But now he texts my friend every single day asking her for advice on how to get close to me again, even after I explicitly said no. My friend tells him every single day that  he's being delusional, but he won't give up and says things like ""if I keep trying, she'll see she wants to be close to me again"" and ""I know I can change her mind"". I hate him; I think he's obnoxious and annoying and egotistical and disgusting.

I could block him, but I live at school and have to see him every single day regardless. He also knows some potentially life-ruining stuff about me that I was dumb enough to tell him at 15, so I'm scared to be too direct with him in case he tries to use it against me. I have extreme GAD and social anxiety and think about killing myself every day because of this.

1697492438.0,The UK is fucked! ZERO EDUCATION ON MENTAL HEALTH,"We are taught about how to look after our bodies as soon as we walk through our first classroom door, but we are taught very little or nothing about our mental health?  
I'll quote The Matrix, ""The body cannot live without the mind"" You can eat all the veg you want, do as many press ups as you want or drink as much water as you want, but if you don't look after the thing that runs it all...none of that will matter.  


It is agreed by the majority of the scientific community, that the thing that sits on top of our shoulders contains the most complicated thing in the universe! So why do we go into our adult years not knowing anywhere near what we should know about it? Suicide rates are climbing, mental illness is climbing and so is the pressure on the medical world to sort it out! 

Just 12 hours ago I was told that one of my work colleagues at another site killed himself last night! We are dropping like flies and help is getting further away for people that desperately need it. The NHS funds things like surgeries for people who want to change genders or to not have a gender at all, but if you want an assessment for something like ADHD you have to wait 4 years now in the UK. The world has gone mad! The ironic thing is that if we put more money into Mental Health funding then people wanting to be genderless wouldn't exist. It's clearly a symptom of bad mental health! These people don't feel like they belong because they haven't been given the right parenting, left in front of a tv, tablet or phone to listen to others that are in the same position and haven't been educated about their own minds.  


We fund wars and natural disasters in other countries and fund accommodation for people coming here illegally, but we can't fund our health care system and save the lives of the people that run the country. During lockdown the government put homeless people up in hotels and then stripped them away after the pandemic ended...unbelievable! I also don't want to hear about covid having an impact on the NHS and our economy and cost of living crisis blah blah blah! Energy companies and big pharma have come out of a pandemic in MASSIVE PROFIT! I won't explain that, but look into why!  


This country is failing, rapidly and I won't be here to watch it completely collapse. People think voting for Labour will help HA! If you believe a change in jumped up posh wankers will change this country for the better then you are wrong. They are there to entertain you, keep you thinking you have a little say whilst they take home a big pay day and buy more land and houses.  


My advice to anyone that is struggling is this! Do your own research and take your life into your own hands because it is possible and you are strong!  
I've overcome Anxiety Disorder, Depression and ADHD by reading, learning about what they do and making time to deal with them. I have 4 sessions of CBT lasting 20 minutes each, I did the rest of the work. Your mental health works the same way as your physical health. The more effort you put in the more you'll get out of it. You do 100 push ups for 100 days you will see the improvements, but you need to put the time in to do them. Same thing with your mind. If you spend time each day listening to your thoughts, googling questions you have and learning about what you're dealing with then you have a better chance. Seek out therapy, seek out books that will educate you and seek out people you can trust! Help isn't coming from the government and probably not the NHS soon enough.   


Lastly, there was a lot of times before where I didn't think I'd make it, believe me I've been in that medicine cupboard, I've held the knife and I've stood on the edge of that bridge! I'm still here. You can do it, you are more capable than you think. If we weren't capable then I would not be here!

every now and then I get this feeling of unstoppable pressure that comes back every now and then , I get this feeling of unstoppable pressure that grows its infinite no matter if I weep laugh or moan its there watching like a shadow .
  
Every time I think I'm getting better it seems to come back and feel like a new presence every time , and although it may feel like a new presence its undoubtedly the same thing there is no other feeling that could mimic the pain that
  
i endure every time this comes around. Something that could easily be mistakeable for a physical injury based around the heart it's able to control my whole well being . When i see it in my head i see it as a place that im in and im 
  
stuck here i cant move all my thoughts now have to pass through some sort of barrier that makes me see everything is a different sort of way , im unable to focus on certain tasks and i get a jelly feeling in my stomach its almost as if
  
i feel guilt and anxiety together , I could possibly be feeling other things that im much less familiar with or i haven't been able to associate it to a something that i already know of . i do know that this feeling which hits the hardest
  
while im alone in my own thoughts follows me everywhere and eats at me , even though its silenced when im talking to a friend or doing something where i have some sort of attention on me something where i feel acknowledged and seen its 
  
always lurking in dount and hesitation it travels through every thought i have like a spike of lightning to remind me its there .
  

  
Anxiety to me is different when directed at different things . its about who i am and who i feel like i am .it links heavily to the fact i never feel safe to act like who i really am and im always on guard of messing up like being ""weird""
  
""loud"" ""annoying"" ""freak"" having convocations to me feels like something i need to do right and i know it shouldn't feel like that . every time i act like myself in front of someone  for instance if i slip up with the constant act that i 
  
put up with or i feel comfortable enough to be myself they start to treat me differently like the respect no matter how big it may have been even if any vanishes and the persona that i put of for that amount of time slips and i lose then ik
  
that person doesn't actually like me even with people like my friends i get it i feel the need to be this person whos funny loud annoying or whatever that group of people perceives me as and i do want to stop and i have often in the past 
  
the just brush it off as me being weird im not able to do things like how i see other people do so like talking to ur best friend and having normal idle chatter or something or updating me or small talk i cant do the casual i always jump
  
to the extream. and when i look at m friends for an outlet to let this out i cant find a single person i hate telling people how u feel on the inside because no matter what you do they're gonna look at you different they wont see u as the
  
same person they saw before that and i hate that because i dont think thats me . also i look around and i think these people dont actually care , yeah u can say ur my friend or whatever u can say that you're there for me but whatever
  
talk is cheap and when it comes down to it no matter what i tell u you're reply with the standard ""its fine"" ""i hope ur ok"" ""how does that make u feel "" thats not what i want or need to hear and its not ur fault its really really not
  
your fault because i dont know what i want to hear or what i should tell other people  i feel so guilty why am i telling you all my business is what i think honestly sometimes i think if i tell someone all of this id prefer it to be 
  
someone i dont even know i dont know why someone ill never see again someone i dont need to talk to which is sudo what im doing here on my notes app i dont know what im going to do with this will i send it to someone or is that a 	
  
bitchy cry for help . idk idk skip that bit i dont know what i need to hear is all im saying but i think inside of me i do know but i wont let myself know i know i cant tell you but deep in my mind ik i know and surface me doesnt even 
  
know what that is. i tried to do this before and i wrote something that i believe to be wrong i said i think i wanted someone who would feel bad for me thats not true i dont want that at all but i was in my own head then and thats what 
  
i though i needed. i have never said or put any of this stuff out before these are usually thoughts that are in my head and now i can visually see them i feel a bit better idk why but the feelings are still there. When i'm out and about
  
i put on a persona i lie a lot i think i might just be a chronical liar and i dont like that fact im just so embarassed of myself and being judged that i hide everything about me all the nerdy details and all i act like im this
  
guy who does these cool things that i may not even do or have only done once or twice its not just that fact that i feel the need to be liked like others i feel the need to stand out and be accepted i wanna be cool i want to be there
  
for other people  but i don't want to comfort other people i hate that because i don't know how to do it its really really shallow but i want to be seen as cool and i want to be accepted by everyone when im in my persona i do things
  
like make fun of ppl to m friends or something like furries pussies (reffered to as like bitches or ppl who dont smoke or something ) or something for example just going w them getting rly nasty even if i have no negative emotions to the other person at all over the last 3 years i have stopped or at least tried
  
to stop for the most part making fun of people to their faces because i actually feel really bad like a piece of shit but something in my head contradicts my previous statement of not feeling bad for myself because i seem to do it a lot
  
i think ive found a sort of comfort in it like if i do something bad i could just say well this that and the other or i wont even acknowledge it in my head as something negative ill give myself positive mental what's the word its like
  
encouragement um starts with an r oh re enforcement ill act like i did something good because the "" cool "" people around me fed into my social mind where i seek social validation.
  

  

  

  

  
honestly I don't think there is a single person in this world who sees the world like i do so i wrote this as if I was explaining it to a normal person and if there is something here that u find idk similar or like u are
  
able to recognise that feeling or emotion I doubt its the same and that's not a pity party i just dont rly know how to explain how i feel without linking it to certain things i tried my best to make this sound as close to my perception of
  
truth as possible
  

  
i didn't rly go into my anxiety and other feelings to other things in my life because i got side tracked but if this is received well and helps me i will continue to share some of my personal mental health diary
  

  
so someone please tell me something i actually don't know what im wanting to hear but let me know",mentalhealth
1697492169.0,"its so hard for me to "" survive ""","TW mentions of eating disorder, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, grief (?)


im a 16 years old transgender male, im depressed and  ive been going on a circle of searching for attention online by older men and women. i started doing this when i was 15 and continued till now. I can't blame them for using me because in the end its my fault for letting them talk to me and stuff, anyway everytimes it makes me even more stressed and depressed than before, and weirded out especially because many of these people seem to like the idea that i self-harm and ive been asked to do it (which i did since that its already commin for me to cut) and also starve, maybe connected to the fact that i have an ED.
the only thing that basically kept me going in life was talking to these people and my eating disorder. 
I know it sounds weird, i know its not moral, and I'm really ashamed of all of this, but tslking to them makes me feel special and wanted, appreciated, its like a drug, i always come back to it. 

reacting food and controlling my weight/calorie intake was also what kept me going: being overly obssesed over these made me forget all the bad things. I fee like the thing i want the most in my life right now is to be underweight (and i am almost but i still see a fat fuck when i look in the mirror lol.), also especially because my brain is convinced I'll look masculine if i get skinny and I'll like my body more, yeah gender dysphoria sucks. 

anyway in these days i feel particularly bad, i cry for no reason and i feel more mad and ashamed about myself, ive started to crave more alcohol (thank god i dont look a day over 16 so usually i cant buy it and have to ask others). 
it seems that im thinking more about my mom, which also passed eight months ago, which is still very very unreal and weird for me. It doesnt feel real. 

honestly ive been having trouble with making impulsive decisions, i feel like im getting more more obsessed over these unhealthy methods, and i feel like an irresponsible fuck these days. sometimes when i make bad decisions i really just stop and think if it was really me making them, its weird.  
i feel very alone and worse, i feel bad just for existing and the most terrible thing is the shame i have ahainst my gender identity amd my sexuality, ive attempted some times over these two but never actually really really tried to die. Im scared (or maybe relieved?) that one of these days ill just get really drunk and do it. 

sometimes i like to imagine what would happen if i survived, i like to imagine all the people worrying for me, and finally seeing my pain, and helping me. yes its very selfish and self-centred but its the only way i think i would feel appreciated. I dont feel good about myself i always doubt everything i do, im a people pleaser and would do anything to be liked.

1697491819.0,Can't find a meaning,"Hi there,

&#x200B;

So I am currently in bi-weekly therapy and the last few sessions we have started discussing what I want from life.  So far all I have is ""I want my family to be happy"".

I can't even think of something else, and my family being happy isn't a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic & Timed) ambition, so I sometimes dont think I'm doing it when I am and vice versa, which has lead to the ambition losing some meaning.

I just don't know what else there is?

I have a skilled job, which I love and don't want a promotion to management so I don't have a career ambition.  My wife has 2 amazing kids which are now getting ready to leave the house and she doesn't want any more and I don't want any of my own.  I basically sit on my PC for 10 hours a day, be it video games or streaming services, I have nothing else (well, except Warhammer, but I'm just not in the mood).  DIY I can only do at weekends as my wife works from home, I clean up a bit but thats a chore.  I just don't know what to do with myself, so have come looking for advice as I am completely stuck.

I don't know what it is but after being close friends with somebody, I feel like they're suffocating me.

Anyway, yesterday I left my apartment for a run and noticed a pigeon sitting outside on the window sill. It seemed uninjured at first though I was unsure on what to do, so I picked it up and put it outside. I live on the too floor of a 5 story apartment block. It didn't really occur to me that it shouldn't have been so easy to pick this bird up, and it did fly at me shortly before picking it up, but as soon as I left it outside the reason was obvious. I'm not sure what was wrong, but the pigeon was having trouble moving, and frequently fell over onto it's face. I left it some water in the hope it was just dehydrated and to give it time to recouperate. 

I came back from my run and the pigeon had not moved from it's spot, it was also been blown around by the wind. So I discussed the situation with my partner and decided to move inside into a box. This was around an hour or two later. 

I came downstairs to find that the pigeon had passed away, in the exact spot I last saw it. I know this happens all the time but I just can't get past how sad I feel for this poor bird, and how frightened it must have been in its last moments. I am beating myself up over this and I know I should just move on. It feels like a sign of something more and I'm having bouts of sadness. Is there something wrong with me?",mentalhealth
1697487350.0,"Is it normal to be upset, because my friend moved away with his girlfriend that our friendgroup dislikes?","Me and my friend group finally met the girl our friend was dating. We were so happy to hear that he's finally moving on after his abusive wife. We are super accepting of people and want to make them feel like they are welcome and loved. We are extremely goofy and love enjoying each others company. We love everyone's girlfriends and boyfriends, but we don't like her. 

When we first met her we just thought she was too shy to talk to us, but the more we hung out the more uncomfortable we got. The vibe was off and she never said a word to any of his friends (our friend group) she just wanted his tongue down her throat or to go back to his place and have sex. He told us their love was mostly physical. I've known him for 12 years and I know they have nothing in common and my girlfriend has said the same thing. They were constantly on each other and she kept wanting to kiss him all the time, he couldn't even talk to us normally like he always would. 

We kept our mouth shut since we were happy for him and that he's finally happy with someone and I didn't know if I was just iffy about their relationship, because of how his ex wife was to him or if my feelings were real. But then two of our friends came forward saying a lot more stuff they see that I didn't (I didn't like her so I didn't want to hung out that much) and we talked more and became worried for him.

and now after a month of being together he moved into another state 12h away with her parents (they know each other for 2 months) He didn't even say a goodbye to us, he literally packed his bags without any thinking or even got a job before actually making such a huge decision.

I'm really sad because we were the most closest from our group and we did everything together, she tried but immediately said she likes nothing of what we did together :(

He also stated that he's eager to move out of the shithole he was living in, but if he moved for this reason then he is settling for the bare minimum...

Questions:
Is it normal for me to feel upset? 
Have you ever felt like someone is no good but couldn't pin point what it is? 
How do I accept it and move on?
should I have said anything to him?

I did well in school but had no idea what to pick in college so I ended up doing something my parents told me to do (I know, that old tired tale).
I could‚Äôve accepted my fate and enjoyed college while trying to genuinely be good at what I was majoring but looking back at my time I was always complaining and waiting for the 4 years to end. It‚Äôs been 4 years since I graduated and while I worked jobs directly related to my degree I wasn‚Äôt satisfied. I knew I was not making extraordinary strides in my career like my friends and I wasn‚Äôt particularly fond of what I was doing. So in 2022 I decided to go abroad to get my masters degree in order to sort of pivot my career in a different direction. Picking something to study was hard because now I had to choose between specialising in my field or pick a completely new one (like getting an MBA or business related MSc). While I thought I made a good pick I was constantly unhappy with it and was always on the look out for a better course with no solid plan for the future.

1697485346.0,I just got a prescription for ADHD and I feel like a moron. I need perspective.,"I know that my experience is probably identical to a lot of the people who post here so I'll keep it brief and cut out the details.

\- I've always struggled to focus on menial tasks

\- Simple homework assignments like reading logs would drive me nearly to tears when I was young despite being so damn easy.

\- Sitting down to work on stuff has always been agonizing. The only reason I did well in school is that I was a good bullshitter and a great test taker. Everything I did was procrastinated and half-assed.

\- Even simple chores are a struggle when they really shouldn't be. I cannot do anything without multitasking, the boredom is torturous.

\- Being a half-assed procrastinator is not cutting it in the adult world

\- My life is being ruined by my impulsivity and lack of discipline. Even when the stakes are high, I can't focus on tasks. Sitting down to do 2 hours of work is really 30 minutes of work and an hour and a half of satisfying meaningless impulses.

&#x200B;

That's the rundown of how my poor attention span has affected me minus a lot of minor details. I finally bit the bullet and thought to myself that I might have ADHD. It makes sense given my behavior symptoms and at times my severe lack of focus. I spoke to a psychiatric nurse (because getting an appointment with a psychiatrist takes forever) and after speaking about my experiences and problems with her she prescribed me Wellbutrin. But I cannot help but feel like I'm just looking for excuses for the fact that I am just a lazy, undisciplined slacker that cannot be bothered to try. I believe ADHD is real and pharmacological intervention is a valid and credible treatment for it. But I have yet to pick up my subscription from the pharmacy and I'm really second-guessing even taking it.

&#x200B;

Based on what I've read, coming off of Wellbutrin can be a painful process that induces mood-swings and takes a while to ween off of. So if I find out it doesn't work well for me I'm committed to a neurological struggle for several weeks. And through this concern I've found myself just scared of the prospect of taking medication for my attention at all. I don't want medical advice about Wellbutrin, I can do the research on the drug myself (even if I get distracted doing it). I'm just struggling work through what might be a toxic attitude I have toward medicating myself for anything. I cannot shake this powerful, dreadful shame that I'm just making excuses and running to drugs to solve my problems when my attention problems may just be a product of my weakness of character. Some lack of willpower. Logically I know that I probably do have ADHD but whenever I think about treating my issues like a medical one I cannot do anything to escape this overwhelming shame keeping me from doing anything about it. Part of me feels stupid for even posting this. I'm not sure if I'm making any sense at all, maybe this comes off as an incoherent rant but I would like for some people with experience dealing with ADHD to help give me some perspective here.

Being suicidal was such an experience. It was so disorienting and confusing and it made me feel embarrassed, guilty, and shameful. And when I got better, it made me better at talking others down because I Understood it in a way other people who hadn‚Äôt experienced it did. Reading or seeing characters who struggle with it hits harder because I was there and I can remember it and it still hurts and feels awful. 

We had a discussion on what we would do if we found someones suicide note before they committed and when the other kids started talking I could feel myself just getting more and more disturbed because it felt so Wrong.

I try not to have a thin skin but this just upsets me for some reason. Like someone replied. ""Wow you couldn't put the dab pen and couldn't finish your math homework"". Most dismissive shit ever.

1697483785.0,I think I'm developing some sort of social anxiety,"Hey. Recently i've noticed that i've gotten more and more anxious when going outside and encountering people (strangers). I first noticed it when going grocery shopping, because i found myself worrying a lot more than normal about other people in the store and what they might think of me. Furthermore even really small things like walking down my street to go to the doctor only to pick a description up have been a lot more stressful. Although the worst was definitely my appointment at the hair dresser, because i was literally shaking, getting stomach problems and feeling incredibly uncomfortable the morning before. The thing is that I was never too much of a social person, but I never really had many problems with those rather small tasks since they dont really include a lot of interaction with people. The only thing that stressed me quite a bit were big amounts of people when walking through bigger cities for example. These recent developments are kind of worrying me and ive definitely noticed the impact it's starting to have on me but I also have no idea why this has been happening. Does anyone know what could be causing this and how i could stop or atleast dampen these symptoms? Or maybe tips on how to deal with that anxiety in those moments?",mentalhealth

1697481758.0,Behavioral Modifications,"I was diagnosed as bipolar in my early 30s and have been trying to improve myself both prior to said diagnosis as well as after the fact. I went to therapy for a few years, have taken (and still am taking) medication. I was taking Sertraline, Lithium, and Risperidone, but am now only taking Sertraline because I determined that the latter two medications were completely ruining my sex drive/life in general. I stopped taking both Lithium and Risperidone months ago and haven't noticed any substantial differences in behavior aside from being able to enjoy sex again. 

Recently I have tried to do more things without my health provider to improve myself. I am listening to positive-sounding music as much as possible to lift my spirits. I am watching videos on YouTube that promote positive/grateful thinking. I am slowly but surely starting to become more positive about my life as a whole, but am still having trouble with a few aspects. 

I have struggled with my weight and overeating for almost my entire life and have recently started fasting from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. six days a week with Saturday being my cheat day. I cancelled my 24 Hour Fitness membership last week after six years of going because I am no longer content with using their facilities due to the men's locker room being frequented by men who don't cover up after leaving the shower/while changing. Their showers and toilets border on being rancid all the time, which is also extremely off-putting, though not as bad as the constant nudity. And their saunas are almost always broken. That and I grew weary of having to wait for 10-15 minutes to use a machine/do a workout. So now I have decided to start using my HOA's gym. It's smaller and only has a few machines, but it will serve the purpose. I have also modified my diet to the best of my ability, though that will always be a work in progress. 

I also have a severe sex addiction which has led to some absolutely idiotic decisions on my part over the course of the last decade, namely sleeping with very loose women and burning through cash. I am trying to gradually wean myself off of this behavior as well because I know that the risk of contracting STDs and going through my savings will always loom large. I also watch porn often, a behavior I know is a direct result of my old man watching porn in front of me when I was younger. It's not healthy and I know that I need to either quit doing so or at least reduce how much I watch it. That and I follow a massive list of models on both Facebook and Instagram and have raised my standards to very unrealistic levels as to who I will date. 

My overall attitude still needs work. I have always been a highly opinionated/combative person, which, combined with my occasional explosive anger, caused most of my past relationships to end. I know that this is also a result of my father's abusive behavior towards my mother, my brother, and myself, and am trying to work on it. I am turning 40 on December 1st and want to become a better person. I've made my fair share of mistakes and have a very long list of regrets. But I don't want my legacy to be that of the world's greatest pariah simply because I didn't set forth the effort necessary to fix myself. 

Now that the above rant is complete, what does everyone else do to improve their behavior/attitude? ",mentalhealth

I‚Äôm pretty sure I have something like depression, anxiety, or ADHD. Ive had history of self harm as well as a dysfunctional family to give some context. Even before I realized the things going on in my house, as a child I always felt different from everyone else. As a kid I was basically mute if it wasnt my parents or siblings talking to me. I never spoke a single word at school and to others until I was like in 7th grade. Ive always had a feeling of anxiety since I was very young. I still remember instances when I was 4 or younger experiencing anxiety and racing thoughts. Growing up I rarely had friends due to this behavior but I also didn‚Äôt mind it. To this day I prefer to only have one close person in my life. Any time someone comes up to me to talk to me I immediately feel drained, as if all my social battery has instantly run out. I also find it anxiety inducing when someone comes up to me because I have to think hard and figure out what to say to them and how to continue a convo. I prefer to not have friends or be very social due to these feelings. Im more comfortable when people dont approach me. What exactly is this feeling? Or what could I possibly have that makes me feel this way? Also I was a very angry kid with very erratic outbursts that I feel are not normal for the average kid. For example apparently my mom tells me i‚Äôve always been mean to my dad and hated him since i was still crawling. I also zoned out a lot very intensely to the point where when I came back to earth there were teachers surrounding me and waving their hands in my face. I went to a psychologist recently and he tested me for ADHD, and said I most likely have it based on the results, but I stopped seeing a psychologist before i could get a confirmation. Mental illnesses like depression also run in my family. There are also times where i feel like i‚Äôve had a panic attack, but I don‚Äôt fully understand what they are and the things that i felt mean. Recently I felt this pain in my chest like the one you get when you‚Äôre in emotional pain and it wouldn‚Äôt go away. I then began to laugh and tear up at the same time. It then developed into me laughing and crying uncontrollably at the same time. My body also felt very tingly and uncomfortable when it was happening, similar to when you‚Äôre trying to sleep but you cant, because your body wants to keep moving and if you don‚Äôt then it feels very uncomfortable. I felt better after it passed, but I still had a bit of chest pain that lingered for a while after it happened. My chest also felt exhausted in a way. Almost like i just ran a marathon.

They would gaslight me into believing that I was crazier than I thought and that I was imagining things. Calling me extremely hurtful things as their teenage daughter who just needed love and acceptance.

Anytime I would talk about how I feel, I was always told ‚Äúgo to God‚Äù ‚Äútry harder‚Äù ‚Äújust stop being sad.‚Äù One of the therapies I did instructed me to list all the things I‚Äôm thankful for whenever I was sad. My brain doesn‚Äôt work like that, it didn‚Äôt help me, and caused me to be ashamed of my emotions and bully myself pretty severely, even self harming. 

Then I got sent away to a treatment center at 15 years old for a total of 14 months between 3 different centers. Besides the fact that just being there was traumatizing, they didn‚Äôt teach me anything new or helpful. I would constantly ask people ‚Äúhow?‚Äù How do I stop being sad, how do I control my emotions, how do I get my brain to be quiet? I thought I was so broken because I couldn‚Äôt ‚Äújust stop.‚Äù I even tried to kill myself 2x before I was 18.

I feel as if people give me pointers on how to improve but if I‚Äôm being honest I don‚Äôt think I can take it anymore . Why am i so imperfect that I need to improve and be corrected so much ? It‚Äôs weird because at university I have no problems making friends , keeping them , talking to people , travelling to see people , socialising , I was born charismatic in a way. But I have moments where I become anti social and everyone is then taken a back. I just need help. How do I stop focusing on the negative ? How do I stop letting the past define me? How do I start seeing what I‚Äôm good at and how amazing I am? Please help üôèüèª",mentalhealth
1697472462.0,It's all coming back and I need help,"Sorry for this being a long post, I cant really talk to anyone about the details, so I'm just pouring them out here. The ""asking for help"" thing is mostly at the end. 

After almost 2 years of total social isolation and individual learning, I started college. In a safe major that Im good enough at and interested in. For the last month, I've been doing things I thought I would never do again - I went to a lot of new places, got lost a bunch of times, and even made effort to try and talk to people!!! Went to 1 (one) integrative meet-up with real humans, which is more than in the last 3 years!!! Made acquaintances with my classmates, and I think they kinda like me? or at least enough so that we spend time together on breaks and awkwardly make small talk.

I am not doing good. I feel like the anxiety that I've been hiding from in my house have come back again in full force. I dissociate for like half of the day. I can only sleep at night because of meds that take me out. I am having strong anxiety attacks again - can't breathe, want to cry, my brain goes into survival ""run escape hide go home no matter the consequences"" mode. I bite myself, pick my skin constantly (the last one especially in school. Im sure people have seen my fingers bleed).

I am pretty sure I am addicted to sugar and have BED, but since I've never been diagnosed, I will only say that it's been only 2 weeks of classes and I often fall asleep or am in that half-conscious state in class, because I have super bad eating habits. And I try eating more protein in the morning, but I cant help but be anxious and overeat and inhale sugar to give myself that dopamine boost. Also, a funny thing, I am fat, the students in my group aren't, and the fucking old-ass bench-desk that I sit in for half of my classes only squeaks under me. It's an added cool sound-effect to my mental torture.

I was forced to stop therapy. I don't know if I was too depedent on those weekly sessions, but having suddenly no one to talk again to just makes me bottle it up and then vent to my mom, who has way too much shit on her plate already, or yell to the void in a reddit post. I had this hysteric crying fit in the shower for like 30 minutes, and I barely cry otherwise. I feel so alone. Like Ive been standing over a void of anxiety and suicidal thoughts on a few rugs and they're all slipping from under me.

I started having those active suicidal thoughts and urges again. I feel so fucking pathetic and selfish and stupid. I want to not exist (and I can't even convince myself that I will miss a game update/show season if i die now, which often kinda worked).

It's only been 2 weeks, and I cannot wrap my head around actually focusing and studying and organising my time. During online school, I got lazy af (and depressed), I admit it. When I come home, I have so little energy after trying not to run away from people that I just want to go to sleep or scroll. And I still have not gotten books from the library cause Im scared of an unknown interaction (and then I panic about whether the teacher will let me use my phone for pdfs). I mean, how pathetic is it that it's been only two weeks and I'm already behind?!

Today (monday), I have my longest classes. After being late 2 minutes, I survived an hour and a half, and then had an anxiety attack in the bathroom and ran away. Went home. Played a video game. Calmed down. Panicked again. Calmed down. Felt like I was a high-schooler again who just ran away and went to mommy for help. I can't be that again.

Now, I am panicking again because it's late and I know I have so much shit to do but I just want to take sleeping pills and peace out of here. And pretend that I do not exist while ripping my skin.

Onto my actual, more specific questions for help (thanks if you've read the whole thing)

1. Tomorrow, I have my psychiatrist appointment. What the hell do I say?

2. How do I study in the evenings and weekends, and not just stay in bed hiding and dissociating and playing video games?

3. How do I not vent everything onto my mom?

4. Please somebody just say that it's gonna be okay cause I am trying to hold onto something right now and I feel like there is nothing and I am nothing",mentalhealth

1697472294.0,I wish I didn't feel like this,"Mostly just writing this to vent I guess. Two years ago I finally got divorced after being married 19 years. The first half of the marriage was good but after we had a child my ex changed. She would no longer allow me to have access to knowing what we paid in bills, I was only allowed to work a low paying job at her company, and she constantly made me feel like I was trash and that it was a miracle I had someone as good as her. I tried mustering the courage to leave once and I was told she'd say and do whatever she needed to to make sure I never saw my kid again. After that I tried secretly going to a doctor to treat my depression but they put me on pills that made me a zombie. It got so bad that I was ready to take the big exit and set out one day with that as my plan. The thought of my child stopped me at the last minute and I decided to take my chances with the divorce. If it got too bad the option was still there. In the two years since I felt like a new man, I was truly happy for the first time in years and started dating an amazing woman.  Suddenly my ex says my kid wants to end the 50/50 custody, severely cut our time together down and is suing me for custody and child support. I thought my relationship with my kid was good and I don't know if I did something to upset her or if she's being manipulated to hurt me. Going through this whole thing again and having to face this person who nearly destroyed me. Getting harassed by lawyer, the financial strain, and worst wondering if I did something to mess up with my kid has got me feeling like I wish I would have just followed through with it back then. I'm not suicidal now, I have people who I know love and care for me, but I kinda wish I didn't so I could just end it once and for all.",mentalhealth
1697472209.0,Past traumatic memories,"My wife and I got married in 2022. I am from a South Asian country where the marriage arrange by our parents.

To start with, I was not able to be nice with my wife at all. I tried really really hard to be best. But whenever I was close with her physically or while talking over the phone, all past traumatic bullying and humiliation memories (which happened at office and in locality where I live) used to flood my head and my body and mind filled with anger. My body used to shiver and i would feel suffocated with her. In the end, I used end up shouting at her and breathing her. And obviously, she was getting hurt all the time. 

My question is why was this happening when I was close to her?

She tried her best to be supportive of me but she started getting tired of this and there were frequent fights and she used to say things like leaving me. It got so bad that the marriage eventually ended in divorce.

1697413664.0,Can your partner worsen your mental health?,"I understand those diagnosed with mental illness are ultimately responsible for their own well-being and treatment. 

I have depression and anxiety (maybe other things too at this point) and have been struggling for years. Over the past year I've put in more effort than usual- I have a therapist, I finally admitted my meds aren't helping and am in the process of changing them, and I own up to the fact that I am not doing well.

I overreact, get upset easily, and am not a joy to be around. I totally get that. All I ask is if a partner knows their significant other is struggling and working hard seeking treatment, is it so hard to be supportive?

When I get upset my partner takes it personally and escalates. I've begged for years I need to feel heard and understood even if it seems irrational. I need them to be a safe person emotionally (NOT a therapist). Instead of being villainized, accused of yelling during panic attacks, blatant ignorance about mental health in general - calling me crazy and psycho while knowing it hurts me, and telling me therapy and meds won't help.

This person has been my main ""support"" for years. Although there are certainly other factors that have worsened my mental health, is it fair to say that having an unsupportive - in fact - taunting partner has actually worsened my mental health?

I feel I have to beg for empathy, compassion  and understanding. What saddens me is people that don't know I have mental illness will see me get upset and still know to give me space.

Today in particular I begged for space and was denied it. I started having an uncontrollable panic attack, got filmed and told to stop yelling. I forced myself to stop crying for the sake of it being filmed and just went and cry screamed into a pillow. The person then decided to follow and not give me space and villainized an obviously distressed moment against me. 

They try telling me I'm wrong all the time and have BPD. They never give validation, they always want to be right. 

I begged if they can just give me a day to myself because I feel too scared and unsafe to drive and move out. They threatened to call the cops to kick me out.

1697455562.0,"Mental Health Relapse. Any advice, support or perspectives?","I've posted here before to try and put what I'm experiencing in words. This is going to be a longer post but I want to try and give a big picture view of what I'm experiencing at this moment in my life.   
I've hit walls everywhere in my life, no one has answers and things are not improving. I feel like I have nowhere to turn, so I'll post it here in hope someone can give me some advice or support or just a different perspective to try and move forward.   
I (34m) am married (32f) with three small children (7, 5, 3).   
My current situation is like this. I'm not employed, I have a few business ventures that are all just dead in the water. I do have one opportunity, that I recently started pursuing. It won't give me any monthly revenue but does have potential for long term viability. However, I am still very green, learning and interning and have to put a lot of time into it to get me up to standard. This opportunity is also the only thing, that I can see, that is giving me some form of hope for the future.   
I have zero money, or steady income. My bills are overdue. My kids school fees are in arrears. I cannot make payments on my vehicles. I cannot pay rent (more on this coming). I cannot cover any medical costs if needed. I cannot buy food or support my family in any ""meaningful"" way.   
Our living situation is a complete nightmare. I am living with my mother and her narcissistic psychopath husband (also more on this coming). This is her 4th marriage. She has issues of her own and refuses to deal with these.   
I feel unmotivated. I feel tired. I feel useless. I feel hopeless. I feel worthless. In the last 2 months or so these feelings have been increasing and I've been experiencing suicidal thoughts.   
How did I end up here?   
I can go back all the way to my childhood, to my mother's first divorce (from my father), that was ugly, violent and traumatic. I was 5 years old and have vivid memories of my dad threatening us with a hunting rifle and assaulting my mother in our presence. But I think I've delt with this trauma in  counselling sessions.   
I can go to my teen years where I got into drinking and drugs and girls to cope with and escape the reality of traumatic childhood experiences. But this I also feel that I've delt with.   
I got married at 26 and had my firstborn 9 months later. I let go and was partying every weekend and just looking for the next opportunity to get wasted. My second baby was born and I still sought escape (from what? maybe from myself?).   
This got to a point where I was endangering the life of my family and came with immense shame. I had a business that was sustainable. I had a beautiful family. I had things in my life that where more important than getting wasted. I decided to seek psychological help.   
I went to a lot of counseling. When I say a lot, I mean like 2 years of weekly or bi-weekly sessions with a psychologist that I formed a very trustworthy bond with. It was quite early on that I was diagnosed with Major depressive disorder. I also started takings medications. SSRI's, another class of anti-depressants (i cannot recall the name or class) and an anti-anxiety medication.   
I started dealing with past traumas, feelings of worthlessness and lack of purpose. I started feeling ""normal"". It was around this time my 3rd child was born.   
Forward about two years. My business is failing and my financial situation is getting tight. I go off the meds, they are extremely expensive, and I did not want to be dependent on them for the rest of my life anyway. We are under lot of stress but were not giving up!   
We go on a family holiday in December 22' to visit my mother on the other side of the country. She paid for the largest portion of our trip and we stayed with her. During this holiday we also get to know her 4th husband a bit more. They've been married less than 6 months at this time.   
Over the holiday my business takes a final blow, I lose my last anchor contract and I'm basically screwed. My mother comes to find out about this by dragging it out of my wife after I had a mental breakdown about this. My mother and her husband decide to invite us to come stay with them and the husband then makes me a proposal.   
He has a construction company that builds new houses. He wants me to come on board because he is struggling to connect to the younger generation of clientele and he feels I can open doors for ""us"". We have an agreement (verbally, I know it's moronic) that I will be compensated monthly, my vehicle and its  payments will be absorbed into his business and all additional work I do will be invoiced and paid separately from the work I do for his company.   
I was extremely motivated. I enrolled in an tertiary program to upskill myself and give this new opportunity everything I had! I was doing good on my part of the deal. I never missed work. I did as I was told. I cleaned up all the ""messy"" situations and did all the ""donkey"" work that was required. First month I receive zero compensation. My vehicle is not paid as agreed. I leave it be and wait for the next month. Second month, I'm compensated 2/3 of agreed amount. Vehicle not paid. I start asking questions. I'm told that I should realize my situation and that I'm not ""entitled"" to anything. ""This is a charity situation"" and we are already living with them and I should be thankful that we have a roof over our heads. This is where the mask of this guy starts slipping. I start doing work for his company outside of my normal duties and invoice the clients. He hijacks my paymnets and takes half of it. When questioned again I am told that he takes all the risk and I shouldn't be under a false impression that I am ""entitled"" earn all that money.   
Things just start going from bad to worse. I worked for him for a total of 5 months. I was not correctly compensated according to our agreement once. I started losing motivation to do any work for him. He committed serious fraud during his business dealings and he wanted me to cover it up. I refused and exposed him to my mother. There was major verbal altercations. I was verbally abused and it was made very clear to me that I am just a charity case. I had to choose to accept this abuse, manipulation and psychotic narcissistic behaviour, or I had to move on and try to make my own way. I then started down the path of starting-up my own construction company. This is one of the ""dead"" ventures mentioned above.   
This man manipulated me, by trying to turn me against my wife. This man abused me by power playing me when I was obviously vulnerable and in need of help. This man shouts at my children, swears at them and scolds them. This happens when my wife or I aren't in the vicinity. Because they are loud and busy and don't want to sit quietly and do exactly as he expects them to. I refuse to let my children spend any time alone with them, or be in the same room as him alone. My mother has told me how disrespectful I was by doing this. Even after she knows how he treats my children. They have had multiple serious fallouts regarding this topic. He verbatim told me one morning that he could ""never love a child"" due to things in his past.  
This man turned my mother against us on multiple occasions. No matter how hard we try to get her to see what is going on, with his business dealings and with us and the children, he somehow still manages to turn her to his side.   
We still live with them because I simply cannot afford to rent my own place. It feels like nothing is working out for me. I cannot support my family in any way that I feel is meaningful. I cannot see a way out of this. I have tried finding a job. I have tried pursuing business ventures in a new town that bear no fruit. I try to network and connect with the community. I have joined a new church and I've strengthened my faith tremendously over the last 10 months.   
I really cannot see the way forward anymore. I have relapsed into a mental state that is extremely unhealthy. I think about suicide way to often. I feel permanent exhaustion regardless of the amount of sleep. I want to go to bed and never wake up. I pray constantly. I ask for deliverance, breakthroughs. I plead with God and ask him just to end this. I have asked him to come fetch me.   
I seriously don't know anymore. I've asked my mother what to do but I realized she's not on my side and doesn't have any answers anyway. I ask my wife, she obviously does not know. She depends on me knowing and doing, and rightfully so, I got us here in the first place. I have spoken to a a few colleagues and a few pastors. They don't have real viable solutions to the mess I find myself in.   
I'm just lost and in need of answers or a fresh perspective or something. I keep on praying. I feel like that is all I do. All I can do. I have no answers, and I cannot hear God voice. I cannot find His will for me. This all is so unbearable. I just want this to stop. How do¬†I¬†make¬†it¬†stop?

But I actually found it exciting? I‚Äôm not trying to be edgy, I‚Äôm serious. I know I probably should‚Äôve at least felt neutral about it, like how you typically feel neutral about news of murders.

I tried to think a bit about how horrible the footage was, and I think I felt something in me, almost a physical feeling. I guess that‚Äôs a good sign? 

And guess what? One of the victims‚Äô appearance actually bothered me? Now, it‚Äôs obvious that that wasn‚Äôt a good time to think that, and that I should‚Äôve just put that aside completely.

I immediately thought to how I accidentally inhaled a little Lysol earlier today, and couldn‚Äôt help but think if the inhalation messed with a part of my brain and ruined my empathy. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I‚Äôve been really scared for my brain.

You‚Äôre probably thinking that I‚Äôm fine because I‚Äôm aware of how bad these thoughts are. The thing is, it feels like this awareness is fake. It‚Äôs like I say these thoughts are bad only because I know people would hate these thoughts.

I‚Äôve been in mental health care since i was a teenager and we‚Äôve tried pretty much anything and everything and most of my issues are pretty much resolved except THIS one thing.

The Issue:

So, every end of the month like clockwork i get incredibly overstimulated, which causes irritation, lack of focus, crying sessions and panic attacks. This happens for minimum of a week to max of 3 weeks.

When this happens i cant work, go to school, do homework, clean up my room, eat well etc. Im physically and mentally OUT.

I try to self sooth (junk food, movies, friends, games) and self care (walking, painting, mindfulness) but nothing actually fixes it, but masks it for a short period of time. The only way to ‚Äúfix‚Äù this is by literally just waiting a week or three until im ‚Äúover it‚Äù 

And by then i missed almost a month of work and/or school and im forced to feel like shit.

What happens next is that slowly over time little by little i get overstimulated again and then im OUT again.

 Its like i explode and then reset, explode and then reset. 

I have been diagnosed with:
-Dysthymia
-PTSD (from childhood abuse)

and suspected of:
-Borderline
-OCPD
-Autism
-Dysmenorrhea",mentalhealth
1697465106.0,I feel like my life is in reverse (M32),"Hi everyone,

A few months ago me (32m) and my partner split up (33f), We have a 2 and a half year old son in pre-school and we were still living together until a couple of days ago (not a nice environment)

My partner has been leeching on me mentally, physically and financially for a long long time. I am not sure why i let it go on so long but there was also domestic violence towards me and recently i got to breaking point and was arrested for common assault allegedly. I was released on condition bail until 8th of January pending a decision (no contact with ex partner and cannot go to my own home that i pay for, she does not pay anything and does not work) and have had to move into a tiny single room at my fathers property temporarily with him and his wife. 

I have a job, i've held it for 7 years roughly now. I take very good care of my son and i love him more than anything ever in my whole existence. His mother however is completely irrational and abusive to me and has been for a long time. I recently confessed all this to occupational health and my managers at work. Some of my colleagues and friends already knew but it has escalated really rapidly over the last 6 weeks (threatening to bring men to our home and have sex with them for only fans including gangbangs, spitting at me, punching me, throwing hot tea at me, hitting me in front of the baby, telling me my mother drunk herself to death because i am worthless ETC). I couldn't move out because i was paying for everything at the property and was taking all the abuse because my baby boy of course lives there and i spend every minute off work with him.

As you can all imagine this has been very very upsetting for me and it has become very awkward in regards to seeing my son as it must be arranged through a third party family or friend.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety along with PTSD a few years ago and have done 3 lots of counselling but i am fearful that now i cant see my son as much and i cant see him overnight as there is not the facilities or room here that i may be sinking into a backwards spiral. I'm now back in a small space where i cannot be myself and i am completely out of routine in regards to washing clothes, cooking food and bathing as it is someone else's home. 

To anyone who has been in a similar situation what advice could you offer to help me through this? I'm a nice normal guy who loves his son and just want to do my shifts and see my boy to make memories together.

I appreciate anybody who can give me even a snippet of hope or advice.",mentalhealth

1697463301.0,Need advice on how to get out of rut,"I (28F) have always struggled with mental health, even as a child. As I've gotten older it has somewhat eased (or maybe I've just experienced it enough times), but it still reoccur several times throughout the year. I especially fall into a depression every late summer/fall - which is where I am again. My depression consists of mostly apathy - to everything and everyone. Even during my good times of the year, the apathy is there.

This year it's been especially bad. I got involved with a man (known for 10 years), but things have been very hot and cold. I am getting my masters whilst still working full time, and I'm struggling to produce what I need to do to pass (papers, group projects etc). Writing a simple 1200 word paper takes me weeks, because I simply cannot gather the strength to write it (usually requires a lot of reflection on hard topics). My friends and I have started to drift apart due to different life stages, which feels sad (several of them have moved far away, moving together with partner, having children). I am not taking care of my home the way I want to at the moment. I have a cat which i constantly feel bad for - but love tremendously. 

I am at my wits end. I feel like life has no sense of direction. I am unsure of my profession (oncology nurse), but I have nothing else I'd want to become. And if I was to go back to school that would take years. I have no hobbies or interests, and every activity I do do does not spark any joy. I need to make new friends but have no energy to do so. I want to find a partner, but my current mood is not the best for dating. The man I've been back and forth with - its not working out, but we havent ended it. I am going to visit him in november (he lives half way around the world) - and its probably gonna end then.

I recently joined a gym and have been going every other day, but I don't feel like it helps much. I need to pass school, but Its taking so much energy right now. I've tried talking to a couple of friends about this, but I don't find it particularly helpful or relieving.

I used to be a very creative person, and I am just not anymore. The flame is gone, it feels like. And I just don't identify with being this way - even though its been like this for much of my life. 

Any advice on how to solve the situation? Both short term advice, long term advice and personal experiences are more than welcome.",mentalhealth

1697449454.0,I think I'm depressed but I'm extremely functional?,"I've been depressed since I was a teenager, on and off. I had motivation only to drink and party back then, or take walks, but never further my life in a positive way. Every effort to further it was given up on, including secondary school and college. I spent years unemployed, an addict, crying so often I was sure I'd dry up, and then I moved city and country. COVID hit right as I got there, and it was oddly healing for me because for once, everyone had to sit at my pace. Everyone had to live like a depressed person. I felt awful watching people feel so poor and miss out on opportunities, but at the same time I couldn't help but feel almost physically relieved from the pressure of having to catch up with everyone my age in every aspect of my life.

Fast forward to after the pandemic, I've worked my way up to a 40 hour week as barista in a Starbucks (from previously finding part time difficult to impossible)

My attendance is fine, I talk to people, I do my job well and want to do better at it so I can be a supervisor, I see people I know  when there's time and energy. I go to the gym, I try to eat properly and am recovering from an eating disorder quite spectacularly. My romantic relationship has healthy practices, its the first non abusive one of my life. We live together and own 2 cats. When I have a little time, I make myself play guitar so I don't forget about my hobbies. I sing whenever I'm in a room alone. 

This is a fairytale improvement from what I used to be. On paper, its a story that could sell pills. 

But I feel like shiiiiiiiiiiit. And no I'm not just plainly overworked, that's only a small part of it, i felt this way working 6 hours a week. I have no hope for my future, horrific self esteem, I cry every day, have absolutely vicious mood swings that get me into social trouble, I feel distant from my partner and my fluffy children, I hate my friends, I am mentally immersed in my painful past and I feel time just slipping away. I feel depressed. But by definition online, it doesn't feel like I am - not based on my work schedule alone, but on the fact that there's very little  I'm incapable of physically anymore. My brain is just on fire. 

I use weed medicinally, and have found it extremely useful for staying away from other drugs and for getting me through my day when I use it properly. Without, I can become an anxious volatile mess who cannot commit to a work day, like I was as a teenager. I would hate to think that weed is making me like this, though I've considered it - it just doesn't make sense that it would, because I feel it treats both physical and mental depressive symptoms and pain. It helps me remain as close to stable as I can behelps me sleep and eat and reduce anxiety so i can stay somewhat focused.  But every medication has side effects so I'm open to that. 

Otherwise, anyone know if you can be depressed but not have it disable you much? I don't want to call it what it's not",mentalhealth

1697461923.0,"Might not be the right place to ask, but everywhere else I‚Äôve looked either blocks the post or isn‚Äôt in line with what I‚Äôm looking for. So, mental health wise, what‚Äôs going on, and have I perhaps lost the plot so to speak?","To cut an exceptionally long story short, I grew up in a wealthy household, and like all children who don‚Äôt have the capacity to see beyond wanting a life of frivolous wealth, I was somewhat expected to carry the mantle, join the family business or set out and find my own way in life. However, ever since being stuck at sea for 20 months (we‚Äôll I chose to go, but at the same time I question the reasoning behind it) to circumnavigate it, and being made to move numerous times from apartment to apartment while abandoning past ideas of becoming a lawyer or a common businessman / entrepreneur, since attending a military bootcamp (by choice, not as some form of punishment) my old thought process and want for financial gains dissipated entirely. 

So now whenever my parents discuss financial decisions, be it buying a new house or a car for my mum for grocery shopping, etc I can‚Äôt help but stifle a laugh at how stupid it all seems. Have I lost it? Have I somehow gone from being exceptionally lucky with the opportunity to live a fairly lavish lifestyle to wanting to avoid it entirely? Or perhaps I‚Äôm just fed up of wealth, which makes me seem even more insane. 

Perhaps I should clarify that I‚Äôd want to be an officer, but the wage gap isn‚Äôt that significant, but the point stands‚Ä¶ what the hell Is going on, other than perhaps some form of delayed maturity and mental reasoning. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on‚Ä¶ it could be tied to me becoming more introverted and perhaps my growing anxiety that appeared out of thin air one day. Although that would probably be due to childhood issues if I had to guess‚Ä¶ anyway, any help or suggestions would help.",mentalhealth
1697461826.0,Lowest point of my life rn,"25M and ive been out of a job for a year now. Never finished college and been okay with that for the most part. College was a stressful and a terrible experience overall for me. But now im trying to pick up a basic data entry job so i can maybe get my foot in the door with data analysis. Ive done data entry and tracking at my old jobs that i had for a few years. Ive taken courses and tried teaching myself the basics. Every opportunity has been met with a dead end and im seriously losing hope. Today i had a talk with my parents about finishing college. Its 6 am and havent slept all night. Im seriously skeptical about going through the rest of college when I already wasted several years of my life there already. How do I even reapply? Do I have to retake classes I already took? Im gonna have to deal with the same little miserable nuisances like i did 5 years ago (no parking, getting waitlisted for core classes, stressing on exams, etc)? Will finishing a degree really be that helpful when all I want is a job that uses Excel, holds some meetings, writes reports and sends emails? I would much rather start learning from jobs rather than waste time and money rotting in classrooms with lecturers who couldnt give a shit about you. But at the same time i cant even land a job to begin with. Applications for universities dont open again until like fall 2024 which means i have to sit at home unemployed for a year while having my parents looming over me with the threat of ""when are you finishing college"" or ""why didnt you finish back then"". Im just beyond stressed thinking about everything and lowkey wouldnt mind if i was unalived by a freak accident tomorrow. I hate being my age. I hate living in this overpopulated, shitty city. Everyone i consider close to me has landed 75k+ jobs with little to no experience in their fields, hell one works at amazon making six figures without an ounce of college experience. My cousin whos my age has a 85k job working from home and has moved out while I suffer from exponential mental health decay by the day. I hate existing in an overcrowded and oversaturated job market when all i want is to have an entry level job and work my way up. I hate being compared to and also comparing myself to everyone else. This is the lowest point of my life and i need help seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. People might say this is something i should take to a therapist but its not something i can afford right now and they havent been particularly helpful in the past.

Im trying right now to get a better career for myself to better my family and hopefully myself.. but im to much of a coward to admit to my partner how terrified i am... im so scared of being away from them and my kids... and my friends.. and i'm scared that it will not change anything.

Everyday, I have this terrible feeling to hurt myself, and others, 
Sometimes when my friend comes over, I have the feeling of wanting to grab out at her, or stab her with a pen. 
I'm afraid these thoughts will overcome me. 
I also am suicidal. 
I think of killing myself every single day, and am not a stranger to self harm. 
I have extreme empathy, and understanding of human body language, 
Yet, I could care less about others emotional state. 
I barely get any sleep, and the feeling of hurting and violence is always on my mind. 
The problem with that, though, is that I'm a good actor, nobody ever noticed.
Never. 

I know I need therapy. 
But. 
I'm scared I'll get sent to a mental hospital, 
Or sent away from my family. 
I need advice on what you think I should do, and if you were in a therapists position, what would you think of me? 
Then again, I'm not being completely honest in this post, 
Do you think I should go to a mental hospital? 
Do I need therapy? 
Should I tell my parents? 

Thank you.",mentalhealth

1697430389.0,I think my sister needs help,"My (25F) sister (27F) has always had issues with mental health. She‚Äôs had some trauma when she was around 15 and did a lot of drugs around that age. Around 5 years ago I found out meth was one of those drugs but she has stopped since. She has 2 children (9 and 3 years old) but she isn‚Äôt really a mom to them. She doesn‚Äôt interact with them that much so it was me and my mom that raised the 9 year old and my mom raising the 3 year old. I moved across the country for school 6 years ago so I‚Äôm not around much anymore but I‚Äôm with them now for a visit. 

My sister has full blown conversations with someone. It‚Äôs completely random things she says like , ‚ÄúOh, I can do whatever I want when I get to hell?‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúShut up don‚Äôt make fun of me!‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúOh my god treestars‚Äù followed by a high pitched squeal/laugh.  I asked her about this and she said that it‚Äôs God she talks to. She seems very rational when explaining it, saying it‚Äôs not a voice she hears but she senses what God is saying to her. She said she was skeptical about it too but then did a lot of research online and now accepts it. 

She still lives at home with no job and no friends but is currently in community college. I told my parents but they just said she does that all the time and she has a rational explanation so what‚Äôs the problem? I feel like it‚Äôs a problem because after school she‚Äôs supposed to move out on her own and get a job. 

She was diagnosed with bipolar and my grandma has schizophrenia but my sister has never been diagnosed. She‚Äôs done some very evil things to me as kids like holding a kitchen knife to my throat and threatening to hurt me. She has gotten somewhat better but she still says very hurtful things to my mom that make her cry. I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm worried about my mom‚Äôs mental health too. 

She said she‚Äôs been to a lot of different therapist and has been on bipolar medicine but nothing worked for her so she‚Äôs stopped trying to help herself in any way. And since she‚Äôs over 18 nobody can make her do anything to help herself.

1697450016.0,How do I M18 get over an ex F19 after 2 years?,"

Even after 2 years and another relationship I still have feelings for this one person. Which frustrated me because logically in everywhere I shouldn‚Äôt like her. This is the deal.
First off I‚Äôll start with positives. She was my first girlfriend as a Junior. She was pretty and we had many of the same interests(like anime, games, basketball and so on). I knew her parents very well and felt comfortable around them. Also knew her brother because we played on the same basketball team. She was kind and cute. I had a lot of fun times with her.
However, she also was very clingy and didn‚Äôt like it whenever I hung out with friends and would get mad at me all the time. I remember feeling like I was walking on eggshells around her. Not wanting to make her upset. Also she had an ex that she was still best friends with. Which I felt uncomfortable with and she kinda shushed it off. She still loved me but I began to start resenting her for all these things. Also her parents made her really stressed out and she took it out on me. 
The one thing that made me end it was during homecoming she decided to not where the corsage I got her because ‚Äúno else is wearing it‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see too flashy‚Äù. Then she decided to hang out with that ex and her best friend for most of homecoming.
Not dancing with me after I repeatedly asked her.
This is where I broke things off after 5 months of dating on a Friday morning before school. She tried to stay together and gave a proposition where we didn‚Äôt have to meet at all. I said I knew that wasn‚Äôt good for the both of us. 
I was really depressed for the rest of the fall semester and year. Couldn‚Äôt get over her. Then I got into another relationship where I didn‚Äôt really feel that same spark. I eventually started thinking about my ex again and I just couldn‚Äôt handle it. I feel guilty for feeling this way and I just want it to stop. So I can move on and find someone else.",mentalhealth

1697417980.0,I feel myself slipping into a depressive episode again but I really don‚Äôt wanna tell anyone because I‚Äôm sick of feeling this way & feeling like I‚Äôm repeating myself,"I (24F) have had an up and down battle with my mental health (constant GAD and on/off episodes with depression) since I was 13. Most of this stems from being bullied, a few major life events, and feeling like the black sheep of the extended family (I have loving parents and a great brother, my sister has turned awful). I‚Äôve had periods of time in my life these past 11 years where I‚Äôve felt pretty decent and worth something, but the last couple of years have been up and down. A lot of my problems stem from my childhood best friend basically dropping me at my worst in high school and basically telling me I wasn‚Äôt what she wanted anymore when I needed someone most. I haven‚Äôt been able to keep close friends IRL since, and while I have gotten better socially, I feel like a complete failure and utter embarrassment for not having a friend group in my 20s (I have friends I have met online due to social media and similar interests but I still feel lonely). I know it also stems from the manipulative relationship I was in for 3 years during undergrad and the first part of grad school, because that kept me somewhat isolated from people.  Grad school didn‚Äôt help my case as my cohort was full of assholes and I had some major life events make my mental health falter. The one up I have is the relationship I‚Äôm in with my current boyfriend. He‚Äôs someone who wants me to be the best version of myself and wants me to be successful. His friend group accepted me well. This made me optimistic going into post grad life. I had the mentality of ‚Äúthings are gonna be great, I‚Äôm gonna move here and finally find my people and make new friends‚Äù so I was in a good place. However, both my taxing job and lack of social life outside of my boyfriend since moving here have made me start to slip. I‚Äôve tried all the normal things to make friends (going to do things I enjoy, Bumble BFF, etc.) and before anyone comments ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre young, things take time, adult friendships are hard‚Äù please stop. I‚Äôve heard that enough and it does not help me. I‚Äôve lacked a good friend group for so long that I‚Äôm so damn sick of waiting for it and sick of feeling like a fucking loser. I‚Äôm sick of being the girlfriend with no friends outside of her boyfriend. I also work with high school athletes and it‚Äôs taken time to build relationships. Things started looking up until the person that used to work in my position came to visit and it went back to me being compared to that person (I‚Äôm also a first year out of school doing a job for two people because I‚Äôm supposed to have a coworker that does the same job). This past weekend also just was the turning point of me feeling like complete shit again because 1: my boyfriend went out of town and I was gonna have nothing to do because I am a loser with no friends (I‚Äôm cool with having some alone time but I‚Äôve had too much of it, I want a social life) and 2: being yelled at by a fucking coach at work for missing something despite me running around and having so much to do (I‚Äôve been reassured that it‚Äôs normal in my job to miss things). I just feel myself falling into a depressive state again because of this weekend and stuff building up before it, but I really just don‚Äôt know if I want to tell anyone. I‚Äôm so sick of telling people I feel like shit, because I feel like that‚Äôs been so much of my life and I am tired of it. I constantly do stuff to try and make my life better and be happy. I know there‚Äôs good in my life, but I can‚Äôt seem to be happy, but I‚Äôm sick of telling people I‚Äôm not happy despite being happy with them.",mentalhealth

i‚Äôve gone through a lot with my depression. when i first moved into my dorm i felt a sense of freshness. i felt alive! i felt like me!!!! 
but then once classes started, it started to crash down with me trying to avoid the reality. 
since getting here, i‚Äôve really grown. i‚Äôve mentally matured and really started to be healthy! i wasn‚Äôt being self destructive. but when i get off my zoom call with my therapist back home, i begin to wonder if i‚Äôm falling back into my old habits. 
one week/few days, i‚Äôll be great!!!!! a few days/week later, im sleeping through days at a time, only getting up to eat or use the bathroom. 
i know seasonal depression is real. it hits me like a brick every year. and this year, i really know i‚Äôll make it through, ill be happy again! but as of currently, i genuinely am worried. my grades aren‚Äôt looking great, i have no money and i haven‚Äôt applied for jobs, my close friends i‚Äôve made here, they are great! but i‚Äôm noticing i‚Äôm pulling away from them, because i feel strange. 

i‚Äôm an only child. i know what it feels like to be alone, i‚Äôm used to feeling lonely. but every time i start to feel like the friends i do have, they don‚Äôt know me well enough, or i don‚Äôt feel satisfied with the friendships i have, i feel lonely. 
it‚Äôs just like, i have some friends i‚Äôm close with and i have some friends i hang out with sometimes, but i don‚Äôt have the connection i am really looking for. 

i‚Äôve been trying to journal and genuinely think about how i‚Äôve been feeling. i‚Äôm trying to remind myself of things i used to do for myself that brought me joy. reading, writing, drawing, etc. 
but i have no energy to do it. i am sitting here at almost 5 in the morning, because i woke up at 12 after sleeping all day, and i‚Äôm trying to tell myself to clean the room, take a shower, do a face mask do things that make me feel productive and not shitty. 
but i‚Äôm struggling. 

i know i will be happy again if i keep fighting it, but since i‚Äôm so used to being sad, after feeling happy and at peace, i feel almost comfortable being sad again.

1697441307.0,Trying to heal from PTSD and realizing I‚Äôm abusive towards my boyfriend.,"When I was 14 I was molested and then from ages 17-19 I went threw a few traumas and developed PTSD. I was raped, then my mom who I was very closed to started dating an abusive drug dealer and started doing meth and one day texted me freaking out saying her boyfriend was hurting her and told me to call the cops (that was the first panic attack I experienced) I then started dating someone and on my 18th birthday I found out he was cheating on me with multiple people and instead of leaving him I moved in with him so we could be closer and try to heal from the cheating. But the cheating never did stop during the 2 years I was with him. 
On my 18th birthday I also had a conversation with my dad about being molested since he never believed me and had told me I was making it up for attention and on that day he said he did actually believe me but didn‚Äôt know what to do about it.
A few months after being raped I took Acid for the first time and the trip went well but after I could only sleep for 30 minutes to an hour a day and went threw a rollercoaster of being depressed and manic for 2 weeks. 
It took me 6 months to accept that I was actually raped and I realized it because one day I specifically told my ex that I didn‚Äôt want him to finish on my face but when we had sex he held my arms down with his knees and did it anyways. I had a panic attack but once I calmed down I comforted him and told him it was okay and to just not do it again. 
I‚Äôm now 21 and finally accepted that it‚Äôs all had an affect on me. I‚Äôve realized my constant irritability has come from me not willing to be hurt anymore and that my obsessive cleaning and needing things to be perfect whenever I‚Äôm stressed comes from me needing to feel in control of things.
I‚Äôm also now in a better relationship and pregnant but it‚Äôs so hard reacting to everything in such an extreme way and knowing that I‚Äôm being irrational.
My partner has been surprisingly understanding but I know he doesn‚Äôt deserve to deal with me like this. 
For example there was a day during winter my cat went missing it was -0(Fahrenheit) outside and my boyfriend argued with me to come inside since I had already been searching for an hour. I absolutely love my cats and I was feeling devastated so when he told me to come inside I was instantly pissed and yelled at him saying he doesn‚Äôt care about our cat and that I‚Äôm going to keep looking since he doesn‚Äôt care if she came back. Eventually I went inside and he tried coming to me to comfort me but I was still mad at him so I pushed him and told him to leave me alone. He kept insisting on being close to me and I kept getting more and more aggressive and feeling trapped so I tried leaving the house with only sweatpants and a teeshirt with slippers but he blocked the door saying it was way to cold and I snapped. In that moment I instantly felt like I was in danger since he wouldn‚Äôt let me leave and I went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and pointed it at him and said he better let me leave. 

It‚Äôs been hard realizing I was actually in the wrong that day. For the last year I kept telling myself I was valid for reacting like that because me made me feel like I was in danger and that he should‚Äôve left me alone.

1697435676.0,Hello Everyone.,"hello. 

  
while I know that this can be traced back to me. I really don't care. I just need a void other than my head to scream into. I can't keep my act up forever.  
For the past year and a half, I have felt no emotion. Not an ounce of actual, real happiness. or anything really. my mind is just, gray. i have interests in what I want to do, but any feeling of sad, happy, anything, doesnt exist.   
I am relatively unpopular. I have a few small friend groups of 5-6 people each. I like to play video games. I'd like to be someone in offensive security when I'm older. (someone who gets paid to hack into companies, essentially.)

  
Now into the deep of this. 

  
When I talk to people, I feel like I'm on autopilot, like I watched the conversation happen afterward. I don't talk about my emotions or about my mental health.   
When I am talking with my morning friend group, I feel like I'm just watching a conversation happen. Like on a TV. Ever seen two characters talking and enjoyed watching the conversation? That's what I'm accustomed to now. Watching other's conversations. Sad, but, the way it is. Look, I'm just speaking my mind here. It won't fix anything, it won't work. But it's nice to know that someone knows. 

  
Just writing this I'm tearing up. Thinking about everything. I guess I just needed to write it out. I don't feel any different, but this is a good start. Oh look, it went away. Not a tear. 

  
I feel the same. again. I definitely feel like there is something there. maybe even someone. I don't think I'm schizophrenic (I hope not). And I hope I never will be. But I feel like there is a small blinking light in the dark. When I think about it, I feel the happiest I've ever felt. Then, gone. But I can still see it. And so I am hopeful. 

  
Look, I don't have any ""plans"" or any suicide to think of. I've been there. ""2 weeks before"",  ""two days before"", looking out of a boat at the water, 80mph. ""Three, two, one."", and crying in my bed the night of the day I was ""supposed to"". It's not fun, and I don't understand why people would want to die in such a beautiful world. That was May, 2021.

  
But I can't experience it if I don't genuinely, actually, really, experience anything to be happy about.  
I feel like a blank slate. Any time you write on it, the chalk gets washed away. 

  
I know that the people I'm around don't want to hear anything about emotions. So I went to y'all. I think paying for mental health is a fuckin' joke. I know y'all aren't professionals. But, if you could make it sound like a conversation, I'd listen to you as much as you read from me.   
Thank you.

This is not the first time i‚Äôve gotten in trouble with the law. Not even 6 months ago I got caught with weed at school which gave me a MIP. I should be grateful that was all i got caught for because at the time i was also addicted to adderall. I was spending hundreds of dollars on adderall every month.

Even though those darker feelings have subsided, I feel like I'm so lost within myself and what I exactly want to do or become. I feel like I'm always on edge of what move to make or who to trust, due to some of what's happened in my past.

I've always been the quiet type, the overthinker, the type of friend who tries to show my support and care. Within past romantic relationships and toxic working environments, it's hard to open myself up and allow people in/letting myself know others because idk their intentions or if they'd just hurt me along the way.

Within a career, I've been so confused and it's seemed since forever that I wouldn't figure it out. Due to that toxic work environment, I've lost interest in getting a job, making friends or hanging with others, and I'm so incredibly lost.

Not to get too personal, but I was pregnant and lost the baby 7/2022. It's seemed like ever since I've lost my child, that's the only thing I want back. But having a child, without having the finances or preparation, it just feels like I'd selfishly bring them into the world without thinking of the full picture.

1697415341.0,Feeling intense stress,"I've been going through a very intense rollercoaster of emotions this last month, and I don't know what I can do to feel more 'normal' or stable I guess. 

This has all been happening ever since I started going to university again (beginning of September) and I've just been really emotional. Firstly I assumed it was because before starting my classes, I had to move apartments, so that was really stressful for me. Then the first week of uni was just awful, lots of heavy subjects and big, important projects to work on thru the year. 

The second week I kept crying every day and I started arguing with my partner a lot(me getting angry/upset about very dumb stuff), I understood that it probably was from all the stress and me being always on the verge so we talked it out and we're okay now (thankfully, he's lovely and great with communication).

But now I just have this intense feeling of anxiety whenever I simply think about university. I had no classes this last week, so it was a nice little break for me, or at least you'd think so. But every day I kept on feeling unproductive, like I SHOULD be working instead of 'lazying around' but the weather's been awful and I've been having lots of headaches and not much quality sleep so I haven't been able to work (I've tried all week as well). I know it should be okay because I've been unwell, but I just can't help but blame myself, 'I should've been doing work' and instead it's already Monday and I've got nothing done. 

I wish I could drop out but it's impossible for me, so all I can do is try to cope and manage a way for me to survive this year. I don't want to say I have anxiety as I've not been medically diagnosed, so I'm just attributing all my mood changes to stress, but I don't know, I keep thinking that maybe I should get try to get 'something' diagnosed? Take some pills so I can stop overthinking? I just don't know how I'm gonna be able to handle feeling like this for 9 more months. There's some days where I genuinely feel like ending it all because my head is going through so much at once it's unbearable. But I want to get better somehow.",mentalhealth

1697427959.0,I can never let my friend know why I relapsed in SH,"I can never let my friend know or why

I've relapsed after almost 10 months clean after these past two weekends. I've gotten close to a couple of them, and there are others who I've only chatted with. Both of the past weekends they've all made plans to hang out, often talking in front of me and sometimes acknowledging I'm not going. I don't invite myself to things I'm not invited to, so I haven't really brought it up. 

My friend (B) has hung out with a couple of the friends outside of school them called me, only to insult me and then be nice and hang up unexpectedly. But today, (B) who I'm close to, calls me while they are hanging out and says that that they are having so much fun. I tell B that that's cool, but she should hang out with the people there since I wasn't invited. Soon she hangs up on me. She has also on and off the past couple days been calling me a pussy because I'm too afraid to be mean to people.

 Later, the two close friends B and D and I are texting back and forth when B out of the blue rubs in my face that that had so much fun without me explicitly, and I had had enough and insulted her back. She was surprised, and seemed offended that I was mad at her. D says that he would be mad too, in my situation, and says that we would of had a lot of fun if I was there. As though I had a choice in coming. It was nice, but I still feel excluded. All my friend have known each other longer than I have known any of them, so I get that they would hang out without me. 

Still, this put me back to feelings of when I was always the odd one out, and for some reason I relapsed. I want to be able to talk to D, but I could never bear to have him think this is his fault, least of all that he should just pity invite me to things so I don't fucking hurt myself. B lives far away so I don't have to see her tomorrow. But I don't know how I'm going to do seeing the rest of them. I can't believe I would do this because I feel like my friends being without me is a personal attack. I don't know if I'm going to keep relapsing again.

1697427429.0,Law student suffering a lot of depression,"Hi. I am posting this here because I feel like I can‚Äôt vent to anyone about what I‚Äôm going through, but maybe writing it will help me out. this will not just be about law school but my life in general.   


I am going through a severe mental episode and I cannot stop overthinking and having shitty thoughts constantly. I feel that this all started not only from lawschool but a compilation of my past. I am a short guy, basically 5‚Äô3, I have always struggled to have decent friends, i was not taken seriously because of my height and of course as many of you are aware, girls are only attracted to those who are pretty tall. Although I am someone who had multiple relationships and decent friends, my height has a major impact on my life. I could see the way people look at me, many could see me as irrelevant simply because I am short and it pains me. I could be standing in a group and someone who i dont even know would ask me why am i short. for these reasons, sometimes i just prefer to stay to myself and not speak and for as long as I can remember, thats what Ive been doing. The reason why I mention my height in the first place is to try to find the root of all the stuff I am about to write about And why I became the way I became.   
 

in undergrad, I was a good student and got solid grades and for some reason i decided, hey why not be a lawyer, so i busted my ass trying to study for the lsat and put in so many hours that my hair started to fall out and i still ended up getting a 154 after my third try. Then when I got into lawschool, my stress of course increased dramatically. Now i feel disgusted with my lawschool, i feel as though I pay so much and they are in no way of help to me at all. I find the school repulsive and truly i regret my decision of going there. anyways, i sucked it up and got through my first year and ended up with a 2.6 gpa which made my confidence sink more. I was always a straight A student in undergrad and seeing that I got these shit grades even though I put in hours Of work daily, probably more than my classmates, i still ended up with C‚Äôs. It was devastating and it continued to just make me hate myself further and expanded my lack confidence and i have been working so much to try and get it up. Now, I am a 3L and i‚Äôm almost at the 3.0 mark but of course any law student knows that this isnt enough to get you a nice lawfirm job except a shit government job that pays less than most 4 year degree jobs. That is another reason why i feel so down. Just the fact thst I chose a career hoping after 3 years of absolute trauma, i would get paid good money, but now the only jobs that are willing to accept me are government jobs that pay shitty. i couldve just avoided lawschool and got any degree and got the same pay from other jobs and avoided the hassle.   


Anyways, as I am trying as much as I can to keep up with my 3L year, I am also Trying to keep my mental sanity. My first 2 years of lawschool were horrible, the only thing that really kept me going are two friends that I had. Basically i knew this girl and hung out with her constantly then i lost her. Then the year after that i met another girl, we spoke for a while, hung out almost daily and boom lost her aswell. So i realized that i dont really have friendships but i have free trials. my friendships only seem to last for a year. Basically another reason why im so down  


Now, I am someone that has a lot of deep regret for many things. Some people pick themselves up and move on but I cannot, i dwell on the past, i dwell on my mistakes and i feel disgusted with myself when i make a bad decision or do something thats sinful such as adultery. basically, to cope, i have just been masturbating consistently, i would say i have a masturbation addiction and this lead to me finding prostitution spots. I only ever used the service one time but i sometimes just go there and hold myself back and leave. Now, due to religious beliefs, i know how terribly wrong this stuff is and i have deep regret. i have been fighting so much to try to get myself out of that addiction and to become a better person but i cant do it. i fail not even a few days later. Right now i have nothing. Nobody. I try to speak and my throat literally holds me back, i try to sleep and the shit i think about haunts me in my dreams. I feel ugly, i feel like a weirdo around people now and I feel like I am always negative and give others negative energy with my presence.  I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I know this all sounds crazy or maybe i am a little dramatic but the feeling i have mentally is fucking me up and theres nothing that i have been able to do about it. My coping mechanism to everything is to go out and try to do anything, just keep my mind busy with something. But that hasnt been working either anymore so i truly dont know what to do. I am just tired and I really hope that one day i can find god again and get better mentally.

1697405729.0,Germaphobia/mysophobia(?) has added a whole new level to my GAD,"This sudden onset of mysophobia(?) has been absolutely wreaking havoc on my (25F) already established and diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder. It began when I became pregnant, thinking back, my husband and I agreed that it seems to have started probably around the first few weeks, long before I even knew I was pregnant (I didn‚Äôt find out until I was already almost 3 months along). I am now 7 months postpartum and STILL dealing with this crap! I‚Äôm so tired of it! 

As a child i grew up in a very tidy and clean home, as a teen I had what many would call the normal messy room of a teen, and after graduating high school and moving out I never once worried about germs or contamination either, though I did keep my place clean and tidy with maybe a bit more stuff clutter than what I grew up in (expected though, my mother is a minimalist and I‚Äôm more of a maximalist, if I had zero self control or care of finances I‚Äôd definitely become a hoarder of antiques/trinkets).

What‚Äôs odd and confusing to me is the fact that I could cover myself head to toe in mud and be happy as a lark with no issue. I can be around crowds and go to theme parks and go into public bathrooms just as easily as the next person as long as they‚Äôre reasonably clean and I wash my hands after. I can walk around our house with my shoes on all day and not be bothered by the thought of germs or contamination. But the world ENDS and my anxiety becomes a controlling issue if the dishes aren‚Äôt cleaned with soap, warm water, and are spotless before I or someone else puts them in the dishwasher, for their second washing/decontamination. At the beginning of this I‚Äôd Lysol EVERYTHING that I could daily, luckily I don‚Äôt do that anymore mainly because I don‚Äôt want my son breathing the air particles in. I refuse to drink out of anyone else‚Äôs drinks, but it‚Äôs only with direct family and my husband, I have no issue taking a sip out of a friends drink. If I‚Äôm at someone else‚Äôs house or staying in a hotel that is not up to my high cleaning standards, I will find the least dirty place (in my mind) and park my butt there and not move or touch anything else or just stand the entire time (beds are usually not a problem since they‚Äôre often perfectly in line with my cleanliness standards in hotels). 

Cleaning wise, my already decently high standards have skyrocketed, if something isn‚Äôt done right I have to redo the entire thing. I can go through a whole shelf‚Äôs worth of multiple stacks of cups in 2 days because once I finish my drink I HAVE to get a new one even if I just got that cup out say an hour ago and I HAVE to rinse it before using it despite them being cleaned twice before being put up. I cannot use anything like a yeti or anything with reusable straws because despite them looking spotless and are very much clean I will start to physically gag at the thought of the potential of having germs I somehow missed in them. 

There‚Äôs definitely other things I do but I have such a bad recall memory, it‚Äôs just gotten bad enough that both my husband and my mother have said things recently about my over the top reactions to germs and contamination in certain areas of my life for the past year and a half that weren‚Äôt issues previously.

 The ONLY thing that has *always* been a problem in my life has been foods touching on my plate. As a kid I‚Äôd get incredibly frustrated and sometimes even have a meltdown if the different things on my plates even slightly touched each other and I‚Äôm still that way although it‚Äôs not as severe of a reaction, I don‚Äôt flip my lid over it anymore if they do end up mixing or touching, at best I get annoyed, at worst I just simply don‚Äôt eat it.

If you‚Äôve read this far thanks for reading my vent. I‚Äôm currently in therapy for emotional dysregulation due to an untreated insecure-anxious attachment issue. I plan to discuss this with my therapist so that I can hopefully resolve this as well. It‚Äôs just so frustrating KNOWING a lot of my issue with this is irrational and doesn‚Äôt make sense but having physical reactions makes it so difficult to do exposure therapy with myself.",mentalhealth

I thought this email would be easy but I'm oddly nervous. I'm the one paying for the service so I feel like I shouldn't have to apologize for myself or explain myself too much. This is what I have as of now. Is ""it is a good fit"" better than ""we are a good fit""? Ugh this is so awkward. This therapist has left me feeling hurt, stressed and misunderstood quite a few times. I just want to move on. I also really don't want to have another conversation with her about this because I can tell that she knows it's not a good fit either. We only had 5 sessions .I've tried to communicate my hurts to her and she would get defensive. Things would just get tense and awkward. I just don't like the way she steers the conversations. I feel like the things she says to me are not helpful. I'd rather end things now before more stress and conflict comes up

1697409258.0,Needing some advice on my feelings,"Hi all, 

I am looking for some general advice if possible. I (23F) have been experience periods of low mood in waves for the last 6 months. Over the past 2 years, I have had spells of feeling low. Sometimes it is triggered by life events such as changing jobs or leaving university. However, other times I just wake up with a bad case of what I call ‚Äúthe gloom‚Äù. 

On days like this, I am very negative and irritable. I almost find comfort in complaining about things and I don‚Äôt have any motivation to do things. I might feel completed disinterested in day to day life. My energy levels are at rock bottom during these bouts as well. During these times, I only want to curl up and stay in bed and I feel like quitting my job etc. I am lucky enough to have a good support system around me but I know I‚Äôm not a nice person to be around when my mood is affected in this way. 

In the past, I just tried to push through these feelings or I would blame it on some kind of SAD since I used to experience worse emotions during winter. But since meeting my partner (21M), I have been thinking differently about things. He is a healthcare professional and has had serious discussions with me about my displaying potential symptoms of anxiety and depression. I spoke to my doctor and they gave me a course of online counselling but I didn‚Äôt find it useful as I found it difficult to engage with the online format. I have been going to a therapist for a few months too. But there are still days where I wake up and feel the gloom. 

We‚Äôve had discussions about how I should really try to block out the negative thoughts and think more positively. Whilst I try to do this, it doesn‚Äôt always help. I have been thinking about anti-depressants but that feels like a big step for me. 

I understand that I am still quite young and maybe this is just something that happens at the beginning of adulthood or maybe I need to get a grip. 

Does this sound like depression? Does any of this sound familiar? What can I do to be more positive?

P.S. I don‚Äôt find breathing exercises helpful and things like gratitude lists don‚Äôt really help me when I feel low.",mentalhealth

First time posting here. I hope everyone is feeling well. 
I have a question and I'd like your opinions and see if there's anyone dealing with this. 
When I watch a movie or a tv show, I'll tend to be very sensible to the plot and will feel the emotion for the rest of the day or sometimes longer. If the main character is sad, I'll be sad for a time. If the main character is this guy with no emotion or a creep, I'll have no emotion and feel weird and think like the character. It works also with people around me.
I find it sometime disturbing because it really affect the rest of my day or few next days. Is there a name for it? Anyone can relate?

1697407814.0,I have a problem and I don't know what to do,"I'm 18 years old, I've failed 2 consecutive years in school and I don't know where to go with my life
the reason I've failed as a son, as a friend and as a student is my insecurity and hate for myself, because of that I also lied to my friends about I I was for about 3 years before they decided to give up on me, since then I did make new friends and I swore to never lie again but that feeling of hate became stronger and stronger every day till it became a constant scream inside my head, one day i was drunk (I'm Italian, here the legal age to drink is 18) and talked about it with my firends , they were supportive and understanding witch made me feel really guilty about it, i don't kniw why but telling people how i feel just makes me feel like a oiece of garbage, like i don't deserve any love or help, I've tried many times to help others and it makes me feel good but also bad because I'm happy that I can helo but I feel like it's an excuse for me to feel better about myself like ""oh, i helped them, that must mean I'm a good person""
at the start of the month I started going to a few festivities in a few towns in my region (notti bianche, cortes apertas) so for three days I only got drunk and smoked weed, after that I thought I was starting to feel better, the screaming suddenly stopped for the whole month and still haven't returned but I knew that something was wrong
last week I started having episodes where if I laughed or smiled my muscles started twitching and I startes going insane, i often punch the wall to relieve that feeling but it's starting to get worse, it's a strange feeling, my muscles start hardening and twitching and I can't control them anymore, before it was just by smiling or laughing but now it happens randomly, I figured that probably that feeling I had that there was something wrong was because I was maybe bottling everything up unconsciously or something and if it is like that I have to let those feelings out but I don't know how to do that and it's a problem because these episodes are getting more violent every time, I'm trying to control these episodes because at this point every time I have one I feel the need to hurt myself to relieve that feeling

1697407700.0,Vent (Long text),"My cooking teacher is disrespectful to me and I always have her on Fridays. In cooking class I find it difficult to understand the recipes and the materials we are given to read and understand. I had trouble understanding texts as a child, and I still have trouble with it. Even in my language. While my class was cooking, everyone except me seemed to understand what they had to do. Since I didn't understand everything, I asked my cooking teacher for help. She came to me and told me to read the paper she had given me earlier because there were explanations on how to properly prepare a salad. I read the first introduction but still couldn't understand it. So I grabbed my recipe and read it over and over again. Still no. I cried and left class because of it. My cooking teacher was worried and followed me asking what was wrong because I couldn't understand everything on the recipe. She asked if I was overwhelmed and I answered yes. She then said that I could help decorate the tables and that I could bring the unfinished salad I needed to make,to her table and I said ok. My cooking teacher also meant if there is anything, I can ask her. When decorating the tables, a plate was missing. So I said that a plate was missing and she said in an irritating tone, ""I told you before,the plates are in this cabinet!."" And of course I got upset.So when I was finished with the tables,I thought I was done because my teacher didn't say anything after this. I went to a different room and grabbed my phone to vent to my best friend and to text my professional companion about my internship. I wanted to cancel my internship appointment because it was on the exact day and because I felt depressed and needed a day off. Then my cooking teacher chaught me and said ""Can you put your phone away? Phones in the kitchen are not allowed!"" And I answered:""Sorry I was texting my professional companion for my internship"" and she meant: ""This has nothing to do with your internship!Everyone is working and giving their best but you arent doing anything!""
I got really upset and cried again. She didn't yell but she sounded angry. Like sorry I thought I was allowed to use my phone for a second. I absolutely don't like her and I have her for 2 years.

I was thinking about my primary school class (elementary). There were 30 of us in that class, and of those 3, possibly 4 have taken their own lives. 2 more are possibly deceased.

My awareness was so blurred I couldn‚Äôt notice if someone was talking to me right infront of me. I‚Äôve lost interest in the things I loved I couldn‚Äôt focus on it it was so bad. 
And my memory was terribly I had gotten so bad I had gotten a job at a fast food restaurant I had to quit because couldn‚Äôt remember anything anyone told me or the things on the menu I couldn‚Äôt answer questions because I couldn‚Äôt remember ya know the answers. And school was worse. 
I felt weak and tired I would sleep all night and go back to sleep after an hour. I would sleep all night go to school sleep through atleast 2 classes then I‚Äôd be tired and sleep all day when I got home And my body overall felt so weak anything would make me tired. I thought I was losing my mind and it got worse over time I was like a zombie it was terrible.
 I thought maybe this is depression but I didn‚Äôt feel depressed I was never sad or suicidal. I went to a doctor a few times I was told anxiety or adhd and took meds for it but it didn‚Äôt help me and the doctor thought it was a mental thing but it wasn‚Äôt. I thought I was actually crazy or this is just how everyone actually lived. I posted one here a few times to get advice but I never got much help.
But I finally decided I‚Äôll get my blood work done I tested everything everthing was perfect except my vitamin D levels. For someone my age it should be around 50-100 mine was at 10 it was really deficient. And sure enough when I looked up the symptoms for a vitamin D deficiency and they were right on the mark. I didn‚Äôt realize ever sense lockdowns I wouldn‚Äôt really go outside I‚Äôve gotten indoors hobbies and where I live when it‚Äôs either really hot or really cold no in between it was hard to go outside. I didn‚Äôt realize I never really did. 
I‚Äôve never been so relieved I‚Äôve actually found the problem I can‚Äôt believe it was something so simple as that. I have medication for the next few months and after one a few weeks my mind is actually starting to clear little by little.
 I just kinda really wanted to write all this out incase there are other people with the same symptoms as me and are think the wrong thing or getting misdiagnosed because it‚Äôs so easy to go to the doctor say my head feels weird and get aderall or antidepressants.I never would have thought this was the reason.

I don't care about school. I'm in my senior year and I genuinely couldn't care less if I fail or not.
I don't care about myself. Brushing my teeth has become a hard task, cleaning my room and doing anything that isn't staring at the ceiling, too.

Sometimes I have days where I care too much, though. Sometimes I get so overwhelmed with worrying about my future that I break down.

My mom says it's a problem. My friends say it's a problem, but it's all I've know for the last 5 years.

this i so long im really sorry i didnt mean to make it this long. i dont really have anyone i can talk to. also just to add, the replies dont need to be supportive. ill do anything to fix my weirdass behavior or get this guy back.  
  
i really want to >!hurt myself!<. i know this is such a stupid thing to do it over, and its so wrong but ive been so hurt and confused. im really sorry, im not sure how to do this. i literally made an account and wrote this as everyone is asleep and i cant stop crying.  
my bf broke up with me but im so pissed off. im the type to be really clingy and i imagine things that arent real and i believe them. so i run to him and beg him not to leave me. i completely understand that i am a lot to deal with. id do things for his attention too, i really didnt mean to be toxic and i promised him im getting better. he helped me alot and stopped me from hurting myself and talking to weird people and a lot more. the problem is that i met him online which makes me a nasty edater.. i am not proud of the shit ive done. i ask god to forgive me all the time. i know ive done some really shitty things to him like being toxic, but i made sure he felt loved all the time and also tried to help him. im even learning dutch for this guy man. its not too bad though as i like learning languages so it wasnt a huge waste of my time ig. but still.  
  
anyway then my parents found out about my exes and what they've wanted me to do. they didnt want me to use social media, so i couldnt talk to my bf for days and it was really hard. i found a way to speak to him again.  
  
the past month hes just been weird. im not sure how to explain but my past relationships have turned out a similar way too and it must be because of me. i tried to work it out but i had no idea.. he didnt really say he loved me anymore. he didnt want to do anything with me and he didnt really support me emotionally. i completely understand that he has a life, wants space and also wants to be supported emotionally but he didnt tell me anything anymore. i told him all the time, i promise i wont force you to tell me anything but i am always here for you. because he was different, i would worry all the time does he hate me is he cheating im so replaceable. there are so many cute and mentally stable girls. would have nightmares and i would get so worried. before my parents found out, he didnt change at all so maybe its to do with that. he wasnt super mean, sometimes he would kind of be like how he used to be but then id just get a different vibe. i think maybe because of what we were using to speak, we couldnt do anything but msg and call but it was risky to call a lot. so that vibe continued and then i sent a uhh picture to him (i am really not allowed to do that and i wanted to show how much i love him) and he was like i love you. so i thought it must be that, he misses it.  
  
after i was able to use instagram so i said we can talk there and he was okay for a bit and then he was weird again. i would send more pictures and yea he was really nice and it was sweet but idk something was still off. a few days ago he seemed really annoyed or something. i wanted to make conversation and he was just clearly pissed off. i said ""im really sorry, are you mad at me ? please dont be mad at me. i just love you"" blah blah and complimented him or smth. and then i said gn and all he said was gn, so i said oh okay. i was really confused because after he was like ""okay im just going to say it. something happened to me and ive been scared to death. ive cried about 3 times this evening. just let me... be happy i reply"". are you fucking joking. im not mad something happened to him, im so sorry the way he worded t sounded like he was traumatised. i felt so bad but i was burning up. i didnt say bad things but i said we need space so you can work this out and be normal again. i was so fucking mad because he knows how much ive been worrying for a few months and hes just now telling me this ? ive said to him so many times, im so sorry that im really overwhelming as a person and my emotions. im so sorry you have to deal with this, im really trying to get better (i actually was trying). I had mock exams last week and i swear ive fucked them up again and this hasnt been helping at all.  
  
today has been the worst fucking day. i gave him space for two days and yesterday he messaged and i said if i could ask him smth. i said can you tell me when you feel like this.. and basically what i said about my exams but less angry and dw i have more mocks !! <3 + i hope hes okay. he said hes not okay but im not the problem. i asked if he wants to talk abt it and he said no so i said we need more space then. i really wanted to know what happened but my fucking head keeps thinking what if hes saying this to get rid of you. i just couldnt let me thoughts win. imagine something did happen and i accused him of that ? fuck. i didnt. he just kept saying im not the problem and i forgot what i said tbh but he said lol and said smth abt my pfp or idk T\^T. i just put ... and yea thats funny isnt it and then i said i dont care what happened, just get fucking help. i wish i didnt say that, now it looks like i never cared about him and that id never be there for him. he said dont email me, i think we have to stop this. why the fuckkk ?? i tried to break up with him multiple times before (maybe sometimes for his attention i know its really terrible but he knew i didnt mean it) and i tried to a few weeks ago but i meant it. i really couldnt deal with having a relationship then, and he took ages to reply and he just said ggive me ur insta quickly. so i cant break up with him but he can with me. i wish hed fucking say he didnt want to be with me then. i saidhis name and asked why the fuck didnt you say this before. he said i really appreciate your love youve given me but we cant do this or idk i forgot. i said i hate you, fine just leave and fuck off, then i blocked him. wish id never spoken to anyone online.  
  
(i literally unblocked him like 5 mins after cos what if he changes his mind in the future)  
  
im so childish i just hate myself. i self sabotage all the time. id never have started being obsessed having relationships if i didnt say yes to the first guy i spoke to. he literally ruined me. and i kept meeting weird people until i met my bf who just left. please dont see him as the bad guy, he is the most respectful guy ever and he is the sweetest thing. i just wish i was older or i wasnt so weird and got attached to people. i think my teddy is him and i get really sad when i cant go places with it. im 15 its so embarrassing. everything about my personality is. i NEVER was emotional or liked telling people them. i was never attention seeking and i wasnt a stupid fucking slut. i used to like my body, not hurt myself, not think looking like a skeleton was beautiful. the internet made me fucking awful. i honestly wish i never ever used social media the way i did. maybe even use it at all.  
  
i just want to know, am i crazy for being upset ? i do not want to self diagnose at all or be attention seeking but i think i have relationship anxiety because me worrying about our relationship is all i thought about. even when we were amazing, there is a part of me that says he doesnt love you really. im pretty sure everyone thinks this about their first couple of relationships. ive told him sometimes when its gotten really bad and he tries to distract me. so he does recognise that i worry.. im sorry for being dramatic. i cant grow up or learn from my mistakes. i cant fucking move on. i wrote something for him if we broke up but i accidentally deleted it and i already told him to fuck off so i cant send it. its basically about what ive learnt from him, what im going to stop doing as a person (being toxic, needy, selfish), what kind of girl i hope he finds and that i still love him and ill always be loyal to him. i most likely will move on but i just cant imagine that right now. i know it takes time but i want to only be for him and no one else. no one else is going to love me the same. i really love him so much that if he wants to be happy with someone else, ill let him of course ! but why wouldnt he tell me that. he always told me if i left id tell you, and he did. but why wouldnt he tell me that. it hurts me so fucking much, he clearly doesnt love me enough to tell me that he will be happy with someone else. he tells me its because idk. he didnt say specifically bc of what happened to him. i have no clue. i deleted the chat. i just shouldnt care anymore but i do care. its been so hard to give him space already now i have to forever ! fuck i cant i really want to do silly things, but this time he wont be here to stop me. i miss him. i miss how he would look after me. im sorry for being selfish.  
  
also with god.. i was so scared of losing him recently as he said he needs time to think about things so i gave him space and prayed all night reading certain pages and saying specific duas. i also had an exam the next day so yayy. he actually did come back and i tried to pray more but i got out of it and i regret it so much. not purely bc i lost him but bc we should pray for god because we want to. he isnt some genie . you have to work hard and have strong faith to ask him for things. so i guess in a way i asked for him to break up with me. im going to try hard with god though and not focus on boys too much until im like 18. i need to revise a lot too and i suck lmao. i hope he has an amazing future and marries a woman so beautiful that looking at her makes you feel so happy.  
  
im so sorry to vent like this. literally it doesnt make sense grammatically and i repeat loads of things like he said, i said, really. i have no idea how this works on here. im really sorry if its annoying or doesnt fit this group idk. i know people have it so much worse, they are dying in wars and i ask allah sometimes to help everyone suffering. i already feel a little better for writing my feelings down. my friends are tired of me being upset over this guy all the time so once again ive turned to the internet. ill mark this as nsfw just in case as this might be triggering (i dont understand tw but i put them so no one will shout at me :) )

Usually when I‚Äôm angry at people I try to communicate and avoid yelling. I rarely show my anger to other people. 
Really the only person I feel ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù being mad at is my partner, because I‚Äôm not afraid that he would leave or be angry at me for standing up for myself. When I argue with him I do not feel out of control. We are respectful to each other even when angry. 

But then recently I‚Äôve been yelling at my dog, and the cats. They are just being animals but I get so mad at them and chased them away from stuff they shouldn‚Äôt touch or mess with.
I have sometimes had a tendency to be violent when I am alone. 

When I was little this only happened a couple times, I ripped the head of my stuffed animal off and smashed a set of Christmas ornaments that had been given to me. I wasn‚Äôt angry at the objects, just angry. This was done alone and no one ever knew.
Now as an adult, I‚Äôll break stuff (only my stuff), throw things, yell, scream, and angrily mutter and rant to myself. I was putting away groceries and was so infuriated that the onion I had wouldn‚Äôt stop rolling, finally it rolled to  behind the fridge and I had to get a broom to get it out. I grabbed the broom angrily, cussing and yelling about how stupid this is. 
Around others I am mild mannered, quiet, and patient. Alone? I feel like I‚Äôm becoming my mom.

There‚Äôs also the fact that my pets do see my aggression and they act scared. I‚Äôve never hurt them or hit them. I never would. I don‚Äôt want them to be afraid of me. I want everyone to feel safe with me, but I don‚Äôt even feel safe with me.",mentalhealth

Beginning. Back in 2017 i had an accident that caused me to go down south mentally. Im talkin hallucinations visually, auditorily, i couldnt remember anything. It was chaos.  Over the next 2 years i didnt take my treatment seriously. I ended up over dosing purposely in december 2019. After that i sought out treatment and took it serious. During treatment, i learned about my diagnosis on the mental health scale. Adhd, manic bipolar 1, mentally delusional, ocd, ptsd, and possibly on the high functioning spectrum. After 2 years of treatment, i stopped. One of my drs told me i was above her pay grade. Only 1 person during my treatment, was caring, told me like it was, and actually helped me the way i needed to be helped. We did alot of work and got alot done. So to the main point. With my diagnosis some of the side effects that i live with, are constant anxiety, the ptsd keeps me stuck in memories and deep traumatic thoughts. I cant shake it off, it wont stop, i feel like no one understands. I feel like no one understands. I stim night and day, when my wife touches me my body just shocks and i get scared and i cannot figure out why. I cant think straight, amillion thoughts a second, its hard to put actions with my thoughts that are necessary, like cleaning working etc. my mind is always in outter space about everything except whats in front me. I feel no one understands so they always think im grumpy, mad at them, coming off rude. I dont try to be that way, but my skin is constantly crawing inside and out i never feel right.

I am an autistic woman and I'm fairly independent, but a recent life occurrence has really crippled me with horrific depression. Mentally, I am the worst I have ever been; I've fallen back into bad shape and struggle to take care of myself on any level. 

When sharing my problems or feelings with those close to me, I feel unable to adequately tell them what exactly I need. I say that I want people to just listen to what I'm saying, but I also have been upset when people don't argue against certain things I say, such as disparaging comments against myself or negative assumptions. I'm also aware that I have damaged my own things, hurt myself privately, and removed my personal items from common spaces to convey that I'm upset and am doing poorly. Of course, no one really knows how to approach me when I scratch my face out of photos or put hurtful notes about myself in my room, but I often feel frustrated because I feel alone and like showing my suffering doesn't make people help me.

I'm not very good at being consistent or clear with how I would like to be helped- any advice on how best to communicate my emotional needs? What do people suggest to say to others when they are seeking mental health help from friends and family?

Any help appreciated.",mentalhealth

1697411846.0,"Its Probably Messed Up, But I Love Proving People Wrong When They Judge Me","I'm pretty depressed and a bit bipolar as well, and I recently had experience with an acquaintance that weirdly satisfied me. 

I generally don't impress people on my first introduction. I can see it with pretty much everyone I meet. They give me an odd look and often just ignore me if they can. I'm a very ignorable person. I've figured out, and kinda confirmed by some friends that I have a very flat affect and I think most people find it awkward or just unappealing. I have resting bitch face, ok lol. 

I'm also a very hard nut to crack. I don't give too much away because I've been fucked several times leading to a suspension at school and even an arrest once. In both situations I was framed by someone else. So yeah people generally treat me like shit, and I think that's a default for many others these days, too. 

So if you wanna get to know me, it's gonna take some time. I don't share nearly anything personal at work. When I do, I surprise people because they judge me one way, and then I show them that I have another side to me. Even teammates I've known for four years sound surprised when I share certain things. 

The weird part is that get a kick out of this. I love slowly proving someone wrong when I know they think they've pinned me down. 

So the situation that made me realize all this was something that happened recently with a friend's wife. Now, we've never been that close. We do the normal chit chat when we see each other and thats it. But at a wedding last weekend, we were put in a few situations where we were kinda forced to talk one on one for a long period of time and she actually got to know me. There was one specific comment I made that apparently had an impact on her because the next day she said that she had been thinking about it a lot and then said she appreciated having me in her life.

Now I know what you're thinking. I'm being sketchy  with my friends wife, but that's really not it. It's just a self esteem thing for me. Over time, I've closed my shell so much that I think my reserved attitude is justified, but it's not. I genuinely love proving people wrong because I think everyone doesn't like me, so when they show signs of liking me it's just am affirmation for me to gain some confidence. 

After thinking about all this, I realize that this pattern is bad, and I gotta just open up more to people. I hate it because people genuinely suck, but there's a middle ground. I know I have a good side to me and people enjoy seeing it. 

So really, I'm just writing this as a way to process it all and be better about how I interact with others.",mentalhealth
1697397914.0,I was complimented today on reddit,"All my life everyone hated me for my face and said I looked like mother gothel. But today I finally got enough courage to post my face on reddit. Immediately a minute after I posted, I was called cute by a commenter. This made my entire day NO it made my entire year. I am not mother gothel anymore I am Rapunzel herself. 

All my life my mom shamed me for not being white skinned or blonde or having blue eyes. But beauty isn't even in the coloring of someone. Plus tan skin is very desert rose aesthetic, brown eyes are like chocolate and my black coarse hair is like an award winning horse's mane which are notorious for being hard to brush. 

I think a big part of why I was always bothered by not being pretty like other girls is because of my religion. Beauty is a huge part of islam in various facets. First of all, all the prophets in Islam were described to be the most handsome men of their time with Prophet Yusuf (as) being said to have godly beauty. 

Second of all, women in Islam are told to cover up their entire bodies except for their hands, feet and face to protect their beauty from the harmful gaze of men. Some sheikhs even think that women should cover their face. I felt like this never applied to me because I have a very ugly face and hideous hair so what would be the point of covering it up? It would be like a pig wearing lipstick, a girl who looks pathetic and dumb for thinking that anyone would look at her. I felt excluded, if every woman was so gorgeous she had to cover herself up then why didn't the same apply to me? This is why I did not wear hijab even though my mom beat me up to try to get me to wear hijab but I was stubborn and refused to wear hijab. However now that I see my beauty, I know it must be covered and I will start wearing the hijab from now on. 

Third of all, Prophet Mohamed (pbuh) really cared about beauty. He would often make remarks about who the most beautiful slave girls are in his hadiths. He even married Maria who was a coptic slave because she was so beautiful. This made me feel bad and made me feel like my own prophet would not like me if he saw my face. The other thing that made me upset and made me question my faith is the prophet's treatment of his first wife Khadijah (ra) compared to one of his later wives Aisha (ra). Khadijah was Islam's first convert and she was a loving wife to the prophet for decades and was a successful businesswoman and probably handled the finances of the household before the prophet actually became the prophet. Basically, Khadijah was pretty much the perfect wife to the prophet. However, when the prophet was asked who is his favorite person in the world, he said it was Aisha who he was only married to for a few years. I thought this was a case of lookism because when Khadijah died, she was described to be very old and haggered while Mohamed always made comments about how beautiful and cute Aisha was even though she was only 6 when he married her. This made me feel bad because I thought that no matter how kind I am to a man or any person for that matter, they will only care about beauty in the end. I also began to compare myself to Aisha, I wondered to myself, how could a 6 year old be so much more beautiful than me?

Now I know all of these things were stupid delusions from me.

I don't know how to explain it but I feel like a real girl now. I feel like if this was Ottoman Empire times and I was a slave at a slave auction, the king would take one look at me and fall in love with me and would immediately buy me to give me freedom and so I can be his wife. I'm not saying I have the beauty of a princess or anything like that, I still know that I am objectively ugly however I now see that there is more merit in my beauty, I think I have a kind face that a king would fall in love with. In fact I think many ugly people usually have kinder faces. 

Also another fantasy of mine since I'm Palestinian is that the IDF will look at my beautiful face and immediately put down their weapons, stop the fighting and give back Palestine their land. However this will always be just a fantasy since I am stuck in the UK.

A stone heart like mine just passed like a kidney stone. In pursuit of amorous beauty for which I will be armored in love, looking back, I seek now a return to normalcy. Beauty is safe for all who is in need of it but no soul was born without it. What was I doing all my life? Every time I looked at my face in the mirror and hated it, it is equivalent to taking 7 spoonfuls of Psilocybin that I scarred my hands with by crushing it to powder myself. I think I am beautiful and I think the moral of the story is that there is someone out there who finds you cute.",mentalhealth
1697411438.0,How to stop triggering from trauma in a relationship.,"Long story short, I've been dating this guy for years, and we had a really toxic relationship in the past. I initiated no contact, and he's currently in rehab for alcohol abuse. I won't dive into the debate about whether people can change; this post is about me. So, he's genuinely making an effort to change, and he has recognized and apologized for all the harm he caused me (no physical abuse or controlling or anything like that, but things like flirting with other women and gaslighting me when I got upset). We are not in a relationship right now; I'm just trying to get to know this new version of him and work on forgiving.

The issue is that he's been doing well, respecting the boundaries I've set, and so on. However, when I see even the slightest thing that reminds me of a past situation where he hurt me, even if it's not related at all, I get triggered and become upset. I end up saying passive-aggressive things, making it seem like I'm not doing my part. I don't know how to change this because I want to stop feeling this way and stop punishing this guy I care about for all the shit that happened before.
I just made a super toxic comment and then apologized for my attitude.

Yes, I have been to therapy and am currently in therapy, which has helped with my self-esteem, but it hasn't been as effective in helping me let go of this trauma.

Have you ever been through something similar before? Whether in my position or in the position of the other person in question.

1697397745.0,How can I get over my hatred of my old roommate?,"A little over a month ago, I managed to get away from an abusive roommate. She's locked me out of the apartment twice, she screamed at me multiple times, would exploit our leaseholder - subtenant relationship to get her way, punched my car and put a dent in the fender and has even hit me (that's not even all of it). Being that I'm a man I put up with A LOT because I knew if I fought back all it would take is one call to the cops and I'd get locked up (which is also the reason I never called them myself). 

My issue is I'm trying to move on but sometimes those memories will play back in my head and I'll get fueled with rage remembering how she treated me. Part of me wants to drive back to her apartment and get revenge but I manage to suppress those thoughts.

I want to get better but I have few challenges to get over first. It‚Äôs not easy for me to be open to therapists. I feel very judged and seen in the presence of professionals. I‚Äôm working on getting better at this. I‚Äôm staying on a consistent medication routine, but that doesn‚Äôt solve the entire puzzle. I can‚Äôt imagine better medication than what I have, so this leads me to believe that behavioral modification or life circumstances are my biggest road blocks, but I honestly couldn‚Äôt say with absolute certainty.

I rarely think that I do anything right. Most of my life feels like a series of increasingly painful mistakes like cracking glass on the surface of a mirror. I don‚Äôt need more help seeing where the damage is. I cut my hands examining it. It spreads.

I try not to over share with others, but I just can‚Äôt seem to stop doing it. I find that I hate myself a lot. I very seldom get to use my education, content creation skill sets, or musical gifts. The older I get, the less opportunity I find to do what I love. It seems that life in America is set up so that we work, pay our bills, and die. This is compounded by the stress of human relationships which in my experience are rarely if ever helpful. I anticipate that people will hurt me badly.  The news is heavy. I wait for war to reach our small town neighborhoods and live in constant fear. I worry about others and feel the pain of people far too easily. I carry it all the time. It‚Äôs so heavy.

Lately, nothing is satisfying. This makes me feel like my arms are tied down and handcuffed to concrete pillars. I push and pull but remain trapped. I frequently think about death.

I would like to leave social media but I don‚Äôt know how. I have friends who don‚Äôt have a phone. I don‚Äôt know how to keep my network of support while also being removed from things that dishearten me.

My wife and I owned a toy store for a few months. Our business partners took it from us and rebranded. I‚Äôm heartbroken about it and I don‚Äôt know where to turn.

It seems that many people have expectations for me. I feel that I am expected to share my hobbies in a small business format. Lately, I‚Äôm frequently confronted with the utter heartbreak of losing so much so often. I feel an expectation to show up, but my bed is like an anvil and rather than being on top of it, I am underneath it.

So many people tell me to rest while others say that ‚Äúidle hands are the devil‚Äôs workshop.‚Äù Others tell me to take business opportunities as they become available while I struggle to pay our bills. It seems that it is best for me to ask ‚Äúhow high?‚Äù as others tell me to jump. I don‚Äôt remember what it means to do something for myself. There is always some sort of motivation to please someone else underneath it all.

I tried to be a leader. I gave it my best, but I couldn‚Äôt succeed. I let everyone down and now my face hurts from crying. Every day is more painful than the last and these compounding decades of struggle have left me feeling like Mac Miller.

I‚Äôm learning more and more how this spawns from self hatred but I can‚Äôt fathom caring for myself. What can I do?,"I recently moved to college and saw a drastic increase of feelings of loneliness and self hatred since I came here.

I know I hate myself and I have for a long time but I don‚Äôt know how to avoid this part of myself that‚Äôs always so critical of everything that I do. I constantly feel like a failure and that I need to be better and I recently hit a low point when I self harmed in my dorm room while I was alone. I didn‚Äôt intend on suicide or anything of the sort I just felt I deserved it after a recent incident involving a friend. I ended up having to get stitches and my parents came to visit me and have now told me that they not only believed what I had done was an attempt at suicide but also that they were afraid for me to be left alone after the fact and they considered admitting me that same night. Fortunately my parents held out faith when I told them I would be ok and let life return to normal but now I‚Äôm left so lost. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around how bad that incident should be, almost as if even though it got that bad it still was deserved. Everyone I‚Äôve talked to tells me to be kinder to myself and to try to ignore that voice that hurts me so much but I can‚Äôt. I almost don‚Äôt want to. I worry I‚Äôll become a worse, more selfish person if I do. I also feel like I‚Äôm still not deserving of a kinder voice.

What can I do? I can‚Äôt worry my parents like that again. 

Some background if you need it: I come from a family of divorced parents and 3 sisters. My parents divorced when I was 5 and I had to move schools around the age of 10 when my mom remarried. I always had a bad relationship with my step dad as I felt he hated me and loved my sisters, it‚Äôs been proven by others and conversations with him since that time that this did happen to be the case though he didn‚Äôt intend to make me feel that way he acknowledged that he made a mistake. I‚Äôm homosexual and this is what I primarily think causes a lot of my self hatred. I believe I‚Äôm bisexual but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt want to be fully gay or if there is actually some attraction to women. I feel disgust and hatred for that part of me, just wanting to be like my friends who are all straight. It‚Äôs also caused friction in a lot of relationships in the past which left me feeling as if that had I not been gay my life would be better.

1697406559.0,SSRI feelings,"I've been taking SSRIs for a year and a half. I had a major depressive episode, the worst one yet, but have had several throughout my life. I've had issues with SH, suicidal thoughts and ideation, and have had attempts in the past. I also had major anxiety, which was causing the most problems for me if I'm honest. I was pretty used to being depressed at this point.

When I first took antidepressants this time round, Sertraline, at the time, I could feel this warm heat radiate up from my stomach and envelop me. It was bizarre. I then felt nauseous and had a panic attack. The first few weeks were rocky, but the side effects went away. No effect on my mood though, upped my dose and, with therapy too, started to feel good. I was getting awful diarrhea and put up with it for a month because I felt like I was finally getting better and didn't want them to change anything. They changed me over to escitalopram, which worked better - no side effects. 

This takes me up to now, where I feel OK and keep forgetting to take my meds. I have tried alarms, associating them with parts of the day etc. but I'm a parent and work full time in an extremely busy job and I will turn off my alarm and think ""right, when I have finished X I will take it"" and I forget. I will take solidly for a few days, miss a day, take for a week, miss a few days... and it goes like that. 

Now when I take it, I feel that warmth radiate throughout me. I almost feel high. No confusion, dizziness, racing heart rate or anything worrying, but it feels like a shield I have put up. Like I am encased in a bubble. I took it just now - remembered because I was stressed - and I felt better in seconds. 

Could this just be a placebo, or do I just not need it anymore? I plan to speak to my doctor, but again, I'm extremely busy. I've been thinking about coming off them, but its recommended for 2 years after recovery and I'm not there yet. I'm also worried about anxiety because although I'm no longer depressed or massively anxious, I don't cope well with normal anxiety. 

Has anyone had any of these feelings? Not sure if they are in any way normal?",mentalhealth
1697392693.0,"My Sister has been depressed for 4 years, we tried everything.","To give a little background, my sister was fresh out of college, my father wanted her to do a government job but she wanted private job. my father basically forced her to not take some low paying private job and prepare for government job. she failed numerous times and it was taking toll on her mental health, so I advised her to stop trying after 2 years. now for 2 years she has been doing some private jobs, she has changed numerous job until now and she didn't like any of them.

She went through few depression stages along the way.

1. Initially she blamed my father ( rightfully so ) for her condition because he did not let her take that private job. at this stage I also supported my father stating that he was only looking for her well being. ( My greatest sin )
2. Then she again started preparing for government job, but she again did not crack it, and then every time result came for the exam, she would cry for a month.
3. Then came private job phase, where she would do some private jobs, but she constantly felt like she was not good enough, she does not know anything about job.
4. Now she is severally depressed, she thinks she is bothersome to everyone, she constantly says that ""I don't like anything"". she does not speak with anyone. she cries a lot thinking about the old failures. she has completely lost her decision making capabilities, where she does not make any decision and replies with every question as ""I don't know"".

We recently found a job for her again ( she left last one because we wanted to give her some breather before she started again ). and she got the job easily. but the moment she got the job she is crying, saying that ""she does not feel ready"". but if she does not do a job, most certainly, she will sit in home all alone all the time, thinking depressed thoughts and her condition will not improve.

We tried talking to some therapist, after few sessions therapist suggested some medicines which she refuses to take. and now she does not see therapist as well.

We don't know what to do. My elder sister ( we are three siblings - the one I am talking about is middle child, I am the youngest ) spends hours talking to her trying to reason with her but all vain.

Please help me with some options to how to deal with this situation. we tried everything, from giving her motivation, listening to her ( she does not say anything unless you basically force her ), therapy, giving her option to do the job or not. she just sits in a corner and keeps crying. 

In our culture it is not necessary for her to work at all, infact we do not need her to work. but when presented with that option she also feels like a failure, as every other family member does have some kind of job. but she also does not want the stress of the job, she says "" I don't want to learn anything new"", and ""I know I won't be able to do anything"".

It is taking toll on us as well, my elder sister basically sacrifices her career whole day talking to her, I try to comfort her as much as possible but after 4 years we are running out of stuff to say. we don't know what to do.

1697405754.0,Do I have ADHD (inattentive) or am I just lazy,"I‚Äôm in my early twenties and was aware of ADHD for a long time, but had never considered the possibly of having it. I think I have noticed some symptoms in the past such as carelessness, low attention span, etc. But am not sure if it‚Äôs attributable to my previous diagnoses of depression/anxiety.

My reasons that I think I have it:

Recently I lost my job ( of 2 years ) because I had made constant small careless mistakes, for tasks involving looking at large spreadsheets and grammar. Since the start of the job I had constant anxiety about getting fired, having imposter syndrome and making small mistakes. I made small mistakes but I masked it (mostly) by working extra hours, and still made mistakes.

I started another job in a warehouse, handling important documents, with strict procedures, but I still couldn‚Äôt manage to get it right, despite being told multiple times. And had anxiety about counting paper numbers wrong, and despite trying my best got my counts wrong multiple times. I was also given specific instructions to keep my eye on boxes but i wandered off multiple times.

In university for the past couple of years I have barely ever watched more than 5-10 minutes of each lecture , and find myself just scrolling through the slides, and copying and pasting them into my notes. During in person lectures or and especially watching movies if not interested I tend to doze off, then wake up missing most of the content. I‚Äôm completely fine in classes where there are topics that involve conversation and social interaction.

Just in general instruction that I‚Äôm told goes over my head, I‚Äôll hear about a quarter of what is being told to me, and I‚Äôll try to piece the rest together, or ask again. Often I‚Äôll have to write down instructions to remember them, but even then I‚Äôll go off track, if I find them to be monotous and half complete the tasks , leave and come back, do some work , procrastinate until the night.

It genuinely feels like i am a slow learner, I when it comes to new processes, and concepts. It feels so draining to learn things , but still mess them up.

My reasons for no having it

I am genuinely engaged when it comes to interacting people,friends, strangers etc it seems like everything about me switches on, the social awareness, emotional intelligence and curiosity. I have no problem remembering minor details about people or places I can have a back and forth individual or group conversation for hours, and be patient with my turn to ask questions and show people that I am paying attention. It seems l can focus on conversation easily, while being aware of what‚Äôs around me. 

For Uni assignments I will always hand my assignments time by making an early start, set out a structure, and spread it out until the last day, so it‚Äôs not as anxiety inducing to finish everything on the last day. Despite checking small syntax and grammar mistakes might be made, but I guess it‚Äôs normal for students to make blips here and there.

1697377648.0,How do I move on?,"So, I had a guy-friend, we've been friends for four years. And our friendship was solid and we told each other things in confidence, we were homies.

Since then, it's been very rough- he wasn't talking to me and wanted nothing to do with me and it hurt. I wanted to make things right and reach out. When I saw him publicly once, he said ""not the place or time"" and left. And the following day, I thought I could reach out and just provide more clarity that I care about him and hope we can be friends and talk about it. But an hour later, he saw the messages and blocked me on all platforms. 

I'm hurt that I lost a person who I thought was a my friend for life. But at least I now have my answer I guess? I feel a mixture of relief, sadness, anger, and confusion. Especially since I told him things about my life that no one else knows. Four years and just...over one joke that he acknowledged was a joke, but just cut the chord. Is there a hopeful outlook? Am I really that big of an a-hole for wanting to make things right? And he's hurt me before and I've forgiven him. The one time I mess up...?

1697403468.0,"""Tough love"" mentality","I hate this. I hate how pretty much everyone in my family older than me (including parents, brother, aunts, uncles, cousins slightly older than me, etc.) has used a ""tough love"" excuse to ""justify"" what they've done to me. I am now 34 years old and am beginning to approach the age that various family members were when they traumatized me. I was 7 years old when my father was 34 and 18 years old when my brother was 34. When my brother was 34; he already had a 15-year-old son. His son died at the age of 18.

When I was 26 years old; I remember my father telling me, ""when you have children of your own; you'll understand."" I don't have any children, never had any, and I don't plan to.

Whenever I've tried bringing it up to them the things they did and said that traumatized me; they simply respond with things like, ""I don't remember that happening,"" or, ""that was a long time ago,"" or, ""get over it,"" or, ""you're weak,"" even now when I'm officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder, social anxiety, PTSD, and two psychotic disorders as a 34-year-old man.

To think that I was once concerned with having narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. I was officially evaluated by an actual psychologist for all personality and mental disorders in 2016 and he determined me to have MDD, SAD, and GAD. Not NPD nor ASPD. Within less than a year; this same psychologist would later refuse to see me and refuse to answer to any of my phone calls and e-mails even after I'd already paid him and his subordinate over $1,000 for the evaluation and for my psychotherapy treatment.

So basically now 2 times I have had dreams that feel way too real, and idk if this is a normal thing for other people but for me it's not, all dreams that I have ever had (or at least what I can remember) I always know they are not real, or like I do go along with what is happening in the dream but I can still somewhere in the back of my head understand it's a dream, they are also in general more fantastical and hazy and all over the place. 

But now for the first time some days ago I had a dream that just felt very real, and I'm not gonna go into everything (cause I can't even remember it all) and I can't even remember the order of it all, but basically in the dream I wake up in my house everything looks the same pretty much but then things just start happening and as things start happening like my blinds on my windows are gone and it like changes that first it's all the blinds and then just one of them or I get hungry and I'm about to make food but then I pause, do something else, and when I get back to making the food it has expired and has mold on it, or next moment where I for some reason left my house, I did not go anywhere just outside my door, I go back inside then to sleep and wake up and notice I left the door open and I freak out that 'did I actually like sleep walk and leave my house and leave the door open', so in this dream I thought I had just woken up from a another dream and this happened couple other times trough out this whole thing and each time felt like it was real, that 'I was now awake', also the clock or time in general was all over the place in this dream, but anyways at some point I finally start to think that this has to be a dream and I have to wake up, and I try to force my self awake, which I also fail a couple times like I'm still just waking up from a dream but within that dream, but finally I wake up and it's middle of the night had not even slept that long yet, but yeah kinda weirded out but forget it pretty fast.

Then last night same thing, I have a dream where I woke up in my house, it feels totally real again, but this dream is just shorter or feels like so at least, and different things happened, like this time my fridge is broken in a way I don't think it actually can be... but anyway, also I think I started to get a feeling like somebody had broken my fridge so I freaked out about if someone random was in my house, then I open my closet where there were 3 of my younger siblings, like they had like beds and everything in there, but yeah so now I'm playing with my siblings, and then at somepoint the other two kinda just dissapeared somewhere I was just with one of them, and then the one with me hugged me from behind while I was sitting on the floor, which at first was very cute but then it started to hurt a little, I was not in any huge pain and agony but I just felt like I could not move and it was slightly hurting on my right side, just this uncomftorable pressure, and then at that point I again realized I need to wake up and at some point I then did and was weirded out about it all again.

But so here I am to ask if anybody has gone through anything similar and does this mean something or is like indication of something more specific, I have been more stressed/anxious and even more paranoid recently, but these things usually come and go with me, or like what I mean is that I have been in similar headspace before, but have not gotten anything like this happen so yeah.

1697376913.0,When do you know you are burned out?,"Hi all! I am a marketing manager and I‚Äôve been with the same company for 5+ years. I am a high-performing employee. I‚Äôve had multiple promotions in the last years. I even left for a couple of months to pursue a unique opportunity they hired me back as if I had never left right after. I have a set of skills that‚Äôs pretty rare and, until recently, was known to be very optimistic even in the face of challenge.

Up until recently, I worked in a team of 7. 2 of my colleagues are on mat leave, the last one left a few weeks ago. The company is on a hiring freeze and decided not to hire replacements. One of them has minimal impact in my day-to-day, but the second one require that I take on more work and an additional direct report, which I did not mind at first because it was a bit quiet and could use some additional stimulation. Needless to say, it did not stay quiet for long and the projects started coming in quickly as soon as my last colleague left on mat leave.

A week ago, the company did lay-offs and a colleague was let go. Since this is sudden, I have to pick up some of the pieces of this person‚Äô work to ensure nothing falls between the cracks. I also work a company-wide project that will be over in a few weeks, but that is quite time-consuming and a bit chaotic as we approach the deadline.

For the last few weeks, I‚Äôve been working between 10-12 hours every weekday. It‚Äôs not like my boss asks me to do that, but there is just a lot of work and deadlines. And working this amount of hours only helps me staying afloat. I don‚Äôt work on weekends yet, but feel very bad and stressed that I don‚Äôt, but I try to stick to this limit. 

I have started being a bit bitter and sarcastic towards my job (I try to be mindful of this when deadling with my direct reports). I also have more trouble sleeping than usual (tired but wired when bedtime comes). When I don‚Äôt work, I can‚Äôt get myself to do anything and even the most basic home tasks seems impossible to do. Is this burnout? When do you know for sure you are burned out? Can burnout happen this fast (after a few weeks)? What are some tips to limit damage and try to get back on my feet?",mentalhealth

I used to be able to have a normal amount of friends, even if they didn‚Äôt really like me that much. now, i have one friend, and i think he‚Äôs starting to hate me. he used to consider me his best friend, and i did too, but yesterday we were having a conversation and i said ‚Äúcmon, you can tell me we‚Äôre bestfriends‚Äù and he said, ‚Äúwho said that?‚Äù. honestly it just really hurt, because a few days before that at school i wanted him to go with me to go talk to people (me and him normally walk around during breaks and go talk to people that he knows or that i know) and he said something along the lines of ‚Äúyou can go by yourself, stop following me around like a pet‚Äù and that sentence has still been stuck in my head. maybe i should take the hint and stop being friends with him, i‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs getting sick of me. we were hanging out yesterday with a bunch of other people, people that only he knew, and some of us were sitting down and eating and talking. it actually wasn‚Äôt that bad, until my friend brought up our earlier conversation where i said to him that we were bestfriends, and he was laughing. he turned to me and said, ‚Äúi‚Äôm just kidding‚Äù but i was still really embarrassed. these were new people too, so it was even worse. none of those girls even liked me, they were all so much more mature than me, they were all super skinny, pretty, and had really good style. one of the girls that i felt really insecure around was this blonde, white, super skinny girl who had the most gorgeous features ever, and had so many friends that i couldn‚Äôt even imagine having that much. she is who exactly i have always wanted to be. she was cool, social, and stylish. i felt so insecure around her‚Ä¶i thought i looked good when i left the house, but when i saw her i immediately felt ugly for the rest of the night. think a few times two of the girls laughed at me, but i couldn‚Äôt tell. a girl who i had a talking stage with was also there, but we had stopped talking to each other, and i lost feelings. she was flirting with me a bit, and then asked me to hoco. i said yes, i didn‚Äôt want to be mean, but i just felt bad. id much rather be friends with her. i‚Äôm just praying that i catch feelings for her so i don‚Äôt lead her on. and if i were to friends one her, all of her friends would hate me. i don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, i‚Äôm just so stuck. i just wish the universe could give me what i want‚Äî to be social, to be prettier, to have a cool friend group, to not be so weird. i don‚Äôt know why i was born this way. i wish i could be normal, better, like those girls that i hung out with yesterday. i wish i was that blonde girl i was talking about. wishing to be someone is weird, but i just wish i was her. i don‚Äôt know why i‚Äôm this way. my mom and sister think i‚Äôm a loser, and my dad is just sad that i don‚Äôt have friends. i don‚Äôt know why my social life is this way‚Äî i‚Äôm not terribly ugly, i have some sense of fashion, i know social cues, i can talk to people, i‚Äôm not mean, i know how to act around people. i just wish my social life was how i want it to be.",mentalhealth

1697395191.0,Did I hallucinate??,"So I just joined Reddit not long ago, and normally lurk, I don't typically make posts. I do intend to speak with both my therapist and my doctor about this, but I want some unbiased opinions, particularly if you can relate to this or if you are a mental health professional yourself. Any/all responses and advice are appreciated.

About a week or so ago, I 33F got an email from my child's school saying something along the lines of having a meeting in the room above the cafeteria at 7:20am, and that they would walk the younger ones to class when it was over. It's only for the athletics students, which my child is in athletics. For the life of me, I cannot remember what day, or the reason, and everyone I've asked so far literally has NO CLUE what I'm talking about. They just make a weird face and go, ""Huh?""

Like, did I dream this but I thought it really happened? Did I hallucinate? I haven't exactly had a restful sleep in years due to some physical health issues, but this is really freaking me out. I know it sounds so small and silly but I can't tell if this actually happened or if I dreamed it or if something else could be wrong.

I've never hallucinated (that I know of) and I know mostly they are frightening, but is it possible they can be mundane too? Or like, could it have been one of those dreams you have right as you're waking up? Most likely just a dream right?

Please ask me any questions cause I may not have said enough here to give a clear picture but I'm not sure what else I can say at the current moment except what I have given, so please ask me questions. I'm really freaked out here. Literally NO. ONE. knows anything about this meeting except me and I remember thinking, ""I need my baby to attend that, it seems important."" Like HOW  does no one, not even the athletics teachers, have any clue about what I'm talking about? Because I swear I got that email and I remember how detailed it was but ironically the stuff I need to really know I can't remember. Any ideas what is going on here?? TIA.",mentalhealth

1697392149.0,"What is the best therapy form for trust issues, fear of being cheated on and trauma from infidelity in previous relationship?","I have come to the point that I HAVE to do something about these problems. For a long time I have forced my self to act as a normal and good girlfriend who functions normally in the relationship, but it is so demanding that I have now become exhausted and depressed. I think the reason why I feel this way may be from experiencing a lot of infidelity and lies in a previous relationship.  
  
  
**So I really need to find out which form of treatment can help. Metacognitive therapy? Emotion-focused therapy? Something else?**  
  
   
  
I'll try to briefly explain what I'm struggling with:  
  
**The problems unfold as follows:**  
  
\- I spend a LOT of time and effort worrying about (and imagining scenarios) that my partner will be unfaithful sometime in the future. I simply feel that there is such a high probability that it will have to happen at some point, that it is ruining my quality of life now.  
  
\-This means that I have problems committing myself completely (having children, buying a house together, etc.), and sometimes it gets me in a sudden a bad mood and makes me fell bitter (because it is almost like I'm alreadt angry at him, for something he hasn't even done, but might do in the future).  
  
\- I think it is difficult to imagine a happy life together with any man, since I think that the risk of infidelity and/or being abandoned is so high.  
  
\- This also means that I become very attached to my partner and always prioritize being with him over friends. I often avoid, for example, going on a girl's trip, because I am then afraid that he will use the opportunity to go out drinking/partying, or that he will be inspired to go on a boy's trip (and then I feel that the risk of infidelity increases). So this also makes me feel trapped by my own need for control over my boyfriend  
  
   
  
And now, living like this for a few years, has made me really depressed. I hate that I can't have a healthy relationship. I hate that all my energy revolves around the relationship, and that I am unable to find joy and/or prioritize other things in life. I deprioritize friends, find no joy in doing things without my partner, and struggle to stay motivated at work and care about my career. I just want to be normal and have a normal functioning relationship, and be free (from myself) to do all sorts of things with friends (go on trips and out on the town etc) and enjoy it. I want to have children and buy a home with my partner, and dare to just go all in on this relationship, without being afraid that he will cheat or leave me.",mentalhealth

It's pretty hard for me to keep up my shaving, bcs I like to keep a beard, so if I have to shave it, I just trim and reduce its volume, but it takes time and demand you to be very careful; as I never leave the house I usually just leave it on the way it is and sometimes it grows for months and months...

I (37 M)  used to think I was mentally stable and I never really understood mental illness of any sort (depression, anxiety etc). I started an electrical contracting business during covid because I lost my job as an electrician in a mine (due to covid). In hindsight, as a mining electrician, it was probably a bad idea to start a business in residential electrical but here we are. 

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs coincidental or not, but i seem to have developed a whack of mental illness in the last year. The last 3 months have been awful. About 2 days ago I wanted to get hurt - not die, but I wanted to get beaten up badly or in a car wreck or something like that. Im extremely overwhelmed at this business and I make mistakes that send me spirialing out of control. I drove 1.5 hours to a job and had the wrong parts. I bought parts 3 times for this job, lost them twice apparently, used them on another job once. I thought I had them but didn‚Äôt.  Yesterday, on a different job it was going poorly (as usual). It came out of nowhere but I punched myself square in the face- really hard. I make the same mistakes over and over and the other day I thought that if I hurt myself, it might teach me a lesson instead of continuing to do the same thing over and over. 

This type of work is newish, but I‚Äôm extremely disorganized (diagnosed with adhd about a month ago) stronger meds one week ago. Concerta. 

My wife (35 F) is usually very supportive but she‚Äôs all but done with this business and probably me. As I‚Äôm done with both also. 

We started a massive entire home renovation, I am in a custody battle from a previous marriage, plus this business, not knowing anything bout business, new meds, phone keeps ringing with jobs fixing people‚Äôs junk etc and it‚Äôs all way too much.  I was dealing with it but after I developed thoughts, and an action about self harm, I thought I should reach out.

I‚Äôm not sure what my question is. 

Is it possible that this business, reno, custody battle all just added up and made me go crazy? Or was I crazy before and it‚Äôs just shining through now?

I will likely be breaking up with her soon bc I don't think we are compatible as a long-term romantic couple. And I already know she will not want to remain friends. So, basically, one meaningful relationship and I don't know how sustainable that one is either. 

Socializing is not easy for me and seems to be more draining than ever. I have kids, responsibilities, etc. It's hard to get out. When I do go out, I don't really talk to anyone. I've moved around my whole life. The friends I did make that stuck have lost touch over the years. 

I'm sure I have attachment issues, I've been diagnosed with PTSD, too. I've been looking for a therapist, but haven't had much luck. 

Anyway, I'm just lonely and irritable. I feel like every day I'm closer to becoming the grumpy old hermit character. ",mentalhealth

1697373461.0,Am I ill?.,"I am a fourteen year old girl; I turn fifteen in 22 days. I don't really have much to say about myself and I question what differentiates me from my peers. I have two brothers, a couple friends who only ever reach out to me, and a loving boyfriend who I stay with on weekends. I like drawing and reading. I have straight A's in English and strong opinions. I like writing about my opinions and reading about other people's opinions. I don't make people laugh very much, and hardly talk. People don't notice if I slip away during lunchbreak. I feel boring. Where is my personality? What joyful traits do people admire me for? I don't see any outstanding talents in the things I am passionate about. I am plain. Mediocre. This paragraph is plain.

I think you could agree that I am basic and indifferent, but I struggle to find those who understand me and speak to me with kindness and understanding. Those who take the time to pick out the right words to comfort someone. I read Albert Camus' books and am interested in nihilism, absurdism, suicide. I don't see many good things about living and think about killing myself everyday. Of course I am happy and silly when I feel like it and spend hours appreciating the beauty of life and how gorgeous it is, even when I am feeling like this. I will stare at the night sky with joy in my smile and think about how I should kill myself right there. I don't think I'd ever actually do it but sometimes I cross the roads without looking and stare at the river a little too long. 

I think about the effects it would have on my family, my friends and community and think about how much pain it would cause them. It makes me want to commit even more and I wonder why. I wonder why they love me so much. My boyfriend, I understand, I listen to him and support him when he feels suicidal and pleasure him when he wishes. My friends, I understand, even though I doubt they would cry. I talk to them about boys and laugh and you know how it goes. My Mum, I suppose I understand, but it feels like she hates me at the moment. She fights me on my opinions and tells me to get over my feelings, but she did birth me so I suppose she would be a little upset. 

I've been thinking about my post's title and maybe I'm not ill or crazy, maybe I'm just a fourteen year old girl with lots of hormones. That would probably be a reasonable answer but I want it to be more than that because I want to be ill. I want to be sick. I want my bones to stick out and have blacked out vision. I want to be more underweight than I already am. I want to be able to die and I don't want anyone to notice.

Also, thank you if you read my post, I know it's large and I could write so much more about entirely different topics like maturity and the human condition and feminism, misogyny, but I might do that later if you want me to. I know some people are going to downvote this post which is okay and I would love some feedback as to why. Let me hear all of your opinions lol. Anyway I might listen to Duster and stare at my ceiling but I hope everyone has a good day! Love you guys‚ù§",mentalhealth

1697386888.0,Emotions and Fun,"Hey there redditor!

My first post, so sorry if it isn't like the others.

If anything is unclear, just ask :)

&#x200B;

I really have trouble with feeling empathy/building emotional connections with people. Everything has been going upwards at escape velocity in the last 1-2 months. I've met so many cool people while doing the things I love because I am so good in them, regardless if its Sports or Academia. Even dating/making friends have been extremely easy, to the point where I almost have too many. 

&#x200B;

The problem isn't with success, it lies in my past. 

I almost saw, heard and felt everything you could've imagine. Be it suicide attempts, cancer, heavy accidents, betrayal, heartbreak, (....) in the upmost extreme manner. It is important to note, that it was always somebody really close to me / somebody who really mattered to me, **NOT MYSELF**. So **please don't worry** about me :)

Because of that I kind of have lost practically all emotions regarding other humans and sometimes i don't even feel happy or in fact any emotion. But paradoxically I am constantly extatic and wouldn't want to change anything, besides live life, since I've never expected life to be this great. :D

I've only talked about my real problems with one person, because they were so extreme (sometimes people would look at me with fear of what I had to go through if I told them). And that person is currently in Military, so I can't even really write to the person. And talking to that person really went a long way.

&#x200B;

**Questions:**

So do you have any pointers on how to feel like having fun/emotions/trust around new people or having emotions generally? Also how do you cope with extreme stress load from past experiences? And finally how do you meetups with normal friends?",mentalhealth

She talks open about it to me but not to anyone else,ok so I am with my gf for about 1 year and she told me 3 moths into the relationship that she seriously tried to end it but failed. her family found out and treated her diffrently. in the last month or so it got worse again and she always tells me how she doesnt hurt herself because of me and I reassure her a lot. I wanted to ask if there are thing I could tell her to do instead of seriously hurting herself like something along the lines of a hairtie on the wrist. this specific one didn't work but I am here to ask if she does it what I can advise her. maybe its important to know that she is 16 and I am 17 and moving out is not an option for her. so basically I just wanted something I can suggest her that doesnt seriosly hurt her.,mentalhealth

1697385841.0,Meditation help?,"I have CPTSD and bipolar 1 and have been using meditation to try to manage symptoms (along with medication obviously). At first guided meditation was really helpful in dealing with feelings of anxiety and panic but lately when I try it always brings up images of something really traumatic for me and I end up having panic attacks. My mental health was shaky at best before but now that I‚Äôve lost a coping/relaxation method I feel afraid all the time that these feelings of panic will push me back in to bipolar psychosis. I only just began to recover from a horrible episode last year that required weeks of hospitalization. Yes, I‚Äôve talked to a therapist and found her to be completely unhelpful.

 I know the methods to deal with panic attacks and I use them when it‚Äôs really bad but what‚Äôs worse is this insidious sort of undercurrent of feeling that makes me feel sick like I can‚Äôt breathe if I even begin to think about what happened. It‚Äôs not exactly fear but a nauseating, squeezing sort of feeling if that makes any kind of sense. Ruminating sucks and I try not to but meditation had been my go-to for dealing with that.

 I guess I don‚Äôt really have a question. I just don‚Äôt know how to even begin to function normally right now. I alternate between isolating because I can‚Äôt stand to be around people right now and going running to try to burn out all these negative feelings but neither really works.",mentalhealth
1697385771.0,How to cope with my mom? Am I a sociopath? ( really long post),"I have a very strained rls with my mom. I moved away from my mom 13 years ago to study abroad. But since I was around 13-14 till now, I always feel pressured, anxiety, agitated when my mom is around. I don't like to be touched by her; before calling her, I need to make sure I am in a good/stable mood. When I was a teenager, I always picture an ideal mother: always calm and stable, a person who has a stable life herself for a kid to lean on. If I need to think about my mom with 3 words, it is going to be: tears, depression, and sadness. She doesn't go to work ( by being a landlord), doesn't have relationship at the moment, and I don't think she has a big social life either.

I understand that my mom has suffered a lot from her life, that caused her to say thing that traumatize me but I understand that she did not mean to hurt me. But the people around her, including me always feel a "" negative energy"" radiates out from her that kind of  suck the others' emotion into that negative direction. Almost every time I talk to her, all I here is complain about why person A treated her like that, person B said that bad things to her., or why stuff like this always happen to her life.etc to such a point I feel like 95% of the people around her have problems or treat her badly.  Before my parent got divorced, everytime they argued, my mom always pulled me in to make my dad felt guilty about the things that he did. Every time she said something that other did not believe her, she always said :"" I swear on the head of X  ( me) that it is true"". When I was a kid, everytime I had my frustration outside ( school/friends/love..), and showed that to her by changing my tone when talking, she always told me "" why do you talk to me in that tone? have I ever talk to you in that tone? you need to talk to me in a better manner"". So I always like I am her only life-boat, or a shield until such an extend that I always have to control my emotions around her, to act like I am emotionless, always stable because I can't show my weak side to this person ... If she knows I am in a rls, I feel like she gets jealous with that person because I spend too much time texting or thinking about my love life. Or my rls with my dad has improved a lot after their divorce and my mom said something like :"" he just want to make it up to you. If you traumatize about your childhood then you should blame him, not me"". Yes, my dad did a lot of bad things when they were together but he moved on and treat me okay so now I can talk to him like a friend, and I don't really associate him with my bad memories anymore. My mom, in another hand, whenever I talk to her, somehow it always make me remember about those bad memories. I pretty much set a clear boundary around her by not sharing my private life with her and just listen to whatever she wants to say whenever we talk, and she told me that hurt her a lot because I don't see her as my mom, and if I understand her situation I should have loved her more not talk to her with this cold attitude.

Our relationship gets worse till the point that I do not want to hear another complain from her, even if she is sick, or if she is suffering from something. I feel like my emotion for her is so full that I can't take anything from her anymore. Even when sometimes I do realize that she just wants to make me feel comfortable around her but my automatic response is to withdraw from her at that moment that I have a really hard time to control or act normal around her. There was a time I tried to tell her if you love me, you have to promise me these 3 things :"" don't talk about suicide anymore, don't compare me  with my cousins or whoever she knows from her life (because she always ask me why my aunts treat my counsins badly but they still love their moms and I do not) , don't talk about my dad anymore because it triggers my bad childhood memories. "" And she tried to explain or justified why she said the things she said but I did not care anymore, I just wanted her to stop those talking so we can both move on and hopefully improve our rls. I just want to have a conversation when she say she is happy, she is seeing this person, this person treats me nice, i love my life, I am doing this and I love it ..etc.

Now I have the ability to bring her to the country I am living in ( she doesn't want to live in our home country anymore because all she had is sadness) and she wants to live with me because she is all alone. I understand her situation but the thinking of living with her scared the crap out of me, and I am also in a long/stable relationship right now that I want to protect. All I want is to support her financially if she moves to a new country and I will try my best to visit her as much as I can , also try to open more to her whenever we talk. I plan to let her stay in an area where she has friends/relatives and doesn't have to really speak the new language because we have a community there.

But am I a sociopath? am I selfish? why can't I love my mom more? why do I feel so uncomfortable around her? The fact that I have to make another call to her cause me anxiety. All I feel right now is guilt and responsibility because she is all alone and I am her only child.

1697365161.0,"Losing motivation, losing energy, losing willingness. What do I do now?","Hello reddit!

I suffer from ADHD, have been my whole life (17, M). It was manageable at the beginning, as I could figure out the answers to my exams at school without concentrating too much in class, so I had time to spend on myself after school.

Now however, school is asking for too much of my energy, to the point where my daily 37 mg of concerta (Methylphenidate) is simply doing nothing. I can't get myself to do anything. I forget to eat and drink, too tired to perform my hobbies, I can't get myself to care about anything anymore.

Just thinking of standing up is demotivating enough for me to not exercise, just having to move my hands around became enough to demotivate me from playing the piano, just thinking of having to google things became enough to demotivate me from programming, or engaging in any project. Even gaming, which is my main source of dopamine, is becoming to feel like a chore. I simply can't do stuff no matter how important might it be.

I'm starting to think ADHD isn't the only factor, but even if it is then it's getting pretty bad. Just wanting to stay alive is already tiring enough and taking a lot of my time at this point. I'm unable to sleep, unable to take care of myself, unable to care, and there's pretty much nobody that I can rely on at all.

Therapy and psychologists/psychiatrists appointments are expensive as hell, and Lebanon is in the middle of a never-before-seen economical crysis, so we can't afford it. Insurance doesn't cover shit.

I'm in this alone and probably will still be for a few years.

Please help. At least tell me what the hell is wrong with me and i'll manage the rest like I always have. I don't think I will be able to tank it all otherwise, not for long.

Thank you in advance. Much appreciated.",mentalhealth

1697374964.0,My struggle,"
Hi. I‚Äôm Harriet, and professionals are not listening. 

I‚Äôm from the uk, and the psychiatrists in the NHS are LITERALLY DOG SHIT. 

so. Where to begin‚Ä¶

When I was at school I was put on a fast track to education plan. It meant I was a ‚Äúgifted kid.‚Äù I believe it was under an oxbridge foundation thing, but I can‚Äôt remember, and my ‚Äòmother‚Äô won‚Äôt show me the documents for some reason and I don‚Äôt know where she‚Äôs hidden them.

Long long long story short - there was another guy on this fast track thingy and he groomed me. His father and him were very sexually abusive to say the least, and to keep it brief. 
But they didn‚Äôt technically abuse me. They abused Mirror. Mirror is a‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. How to say this‚Ä¶. She‚Äôs dead basically. She is a vengeful spirit. Fuck sake. I already sound delusional. Mirror is 100% real. I can assure everyone of that. It‚Äôs a very complex situation though, and this post would go on forever if I didn‚Äôt keep it brief. 

The boy broke up with me after 3 years or something? and I felt nothing. For a while. 

Then I was taken to a Glenfield mental health unit. The psychiatrist said ‚Äúthere is not a court on the land that will deem you without capacity. If you want to kill him, on your head be it‚Äù and he let me go. 

Mirror killed fifteen people that night.

I was taken back after spending some time (?) in custody. They VERY quickly deemed my without capacity. So I was sent back. Which I found funny.


After a while a while a while of background deliberation - I was sent home on an outpatient section, I believe. Something to do with my age or something??? But they never seem to check. I‚Äôve literally lived away from that place for over a year since - and they never even fucking knew.

Mirror discovered online dating. Thought it would be a good idea to find some sustenance. She found a guy.

We‚Äôve been together ever since, but I keep wanting to kill myself. And John won‚Äôt go away either. But he‚Äôs good company for mirror. 

Mirror changed her mind and decided she wanted to see if she could fall in love with him.

Didn‚Äôt work.

I‚Äôm on medication. But it makes me fat. The psychiatrist says it doesn‚Äôt. But I know he‚Äôs lying to me. 

I want to cut the fat off my body sometimes.

It‚Äôs worse in the spring 100%. But he didn‚Äôt listen. He said ‚Äúeverybody gets down sometimes‚Äù

I have been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder.

But I disagree. A lot. 

Another psychiatrist said I‚Äôm possessed. I believe him. He really helped cement my belief that I‚Äôve been right all along. He‚Äôs the only decent one I‚Äôve had. 

I‚Äôm very confused, but I also feel nothing.

And I won‚Äôt apologise for killing those people. Why am I the bad person???? I didn‚Äôt even do anything, and even if I did, they were terrible. I did the right thing.

Can anyone recommend private psychiatric help? I feel i probably need some guidance or something. Because my medication is stupid and so are the psychiatrists.

(I mentioned everything here to my mum, and she said I seem fine. But I need a second opinion - preferably from a non-shit psychiatrist?)",mentalhealth
1697374235.0,Doing anything takes too much effort and it's slowly ruining my life.,"TLDR: Title. 

For some reason the main symptom of whatever disorder I have is that it's inherently exhausting for my brain to just... ""do"" anything. It just seems to take a hundred times more resources for me than for other people. 
It's not a specific part of acting that takes more effort, and it seems to be independent of the context of doing (i.e. what I want to do, what environment I want to do it in, how I feel, what I've done before, etc.). It's the process itself which drains energy. 
But the weird thing is that doing things is not at all difficult for me. I don't have any problems with executive functions, nor with motor control, nor with cognition. 

My therapist and I have gone through an incredibly long list of possible diagnoses, and we've considered hundreds of other possible psychological causes. We've also considered physical causes, I've had my thyroid and blood checked, but it's rather unlikely since I don't have any physical symptoms (not even ones that might match things like ME/CFS, Long-Covid, etc.). 

It's so frustrating, because my main symptom doesn't really... exist in the mental health literature. It's always something else that only gets called ""everything takes too much effort"".
One example is when I try to look this up on the internet: It tends to be either ""You're already exhausted from something else, so doing more takes way more effort than it should"" or ""This aspect of doing things is way more difficult for you, which makes an 'easy' process into a 'difficult' one, thus taking more effort"". I have never found anyone or anything that even remotely resembles my experience. 

The worst thing about this is that it seems to get worse. I've already showed signs of this since early childhood, then it started to make itself known more and more throughout school, and now as a young adult it's really starting to ruin my life. I'm very lucky to have a really good support network, but I still kinda need to, you know, interact with the world if I want to survive/live in it. Apart from the fact that I also *want* to interact with the world. 

If you're still reading this vent, thank you! 
I'm writing this for other reasons, apart from venting. 
One is to maybe, just maybe, find someone else who has this symptom. If you think you relate, please feel free to message me. 
The other is to practice explaining my experience to others. There will undoubtedly be other situations where I have to explain myself, so please feel free to ""review"" this post (in a friendly way, please). What I'm specifically interested in are the parts where I succeed in being clear and understandable about my experience, and the parts where I don't. 

In any case, have a nice (or at least tolerable) day!",mentalhealth

1697372834.0,This is about my father. Not necessarily about me but it does affect me.,"So I'm 24 m and I'm stuck at home due to my disability don't want to get into that.

So I'm here taking care of my father and my mother. Essentially they're both 60 ish.


Anyway on to the meat of the subject it all happened a long long while ago. I found my neighbor smoking a bit. A little bit of weed out of a bottle in my infantile mind. I thought it would be a great idea to tell my father about it but ever since then he's been going all on and on and on. But the neighbors how their thugs and thugs drug dealer and all this stuff. So you need to call the police if you need to be dealt with. Need to be dealt with.



I jumped ahead of it there

We've had any noisy neighbors for a while now. Noise cigarette buds over the fans parties you know the whole spiel. But it's affected my father in a way that I don't know how it's affected him and I don't know how to help him.


So we'll start with a recent event. My father is currently obsessed and I mean obsessed with getting my neighbor's tree trimmed of the borderline. We got the tree turned before but he was not satisfied. He wanted to get a trimmed even more so she got an arborist out to get the tree trimmed now. I was against the idea for a long time but he finally was able to copes me into it by going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on about it finally after mentally giving up and let him do whatever the f****** wants.


My father is obsessed with the neighbors to such a degree is horrifying and it's putting a massive damper on my mental health and my mother's. He sighs some pops gets really angry, not violent. He's never been violent. Just really angry ignores people. It's become bad and it's I don't know what to do.

He keeps going on about how the neighbors need to be dealt with its his reputation on the line.

How are people going to look at me? See me back down because of him.

 He needs to be dealt with
He needs to be dealt with. That's his favorite line.

I think it's purely for vengeance. He's being purely vengeful.

My father doesn't work. He's going to disability that prevents him from working so he's been in the house for the whole time it's getting worse and worse over time. We tried to tell him to try some antidepressants saying that will help him after he tries some, which I know now was a terrible idea. Technically my mother's idea. Terrible anyway.

But now he keeps using the line well you told me to take the pills I look we are the neighbors still there.

We hope the pills would calm him down. Make him think more rationally evidently not.


He lashed out of my mother one time. Not physically but verbally because they were driving down the driveway and as we're driving down the driveway my father was staring my neighbor directly in the eyes and my mother could see it so she tried to get him to stop. He got up to stop but it got really f****** angry in the car sounding shouting at her. Like how f****** dare you do that to me and all that?.


So as you've seen this post that's all over the place cuz I don't really know where to stop and start.

I'm honestly at my witts end and I don't know what to do.
We had a dog before when we had the dog. It was never this bad. He never used to talk but the neighbors. But ever since we lost the dog everything's been on level 10. Sorry level 500.

Some people may say when reading that. Why don't you get another dog? We've thought about that, but we're scared that he'll start neglecting the dog because he's more concerned with the neighbors and he won't walk the dogs. He doesn't want to encounter the neighbor whilst walking the dog.


So what do you think is up with my father.",mentalhealth

1697371133.0,"My fear and resistance to taking medication for my anxiety and depression (rant sharing, discussion, and open to feedback)","This is a long post not just about my fear of medication for anxiety and depression, but also my story of anxiety and depression, ***so first here's the tl;dr***. 

***But before the tl;dr:***

* Thank you so much to everyone that read this and gave thoughtful responses, feedback, and support. 
* **All I ask from you is to please be kind if you're taking the time to respond to me.** I wrote this because at the moment I'm not in the best frame of mind and have turned to reddit as a way to cope with my anxiety and depression.

***Important note***: 

* You'll read that I reference suicidal ideation. **I've never attempted suicide** and I am **NOT** in crisis. 
* However, suicidal ideation has been a regular mechanism of my fight or flight mode as strange as that may sound (although, in this subreddit, maybe not).

***tl;dr***

* I'm resistant to anxiety and depression medication due to concerns about their effectiveness, side effects, and a difficult family history that entails taking medication and it not really working. 
* I have a long history of mental health struggles, and ongoing struggles with anxiety and depression today. This is exacerbated by worries about money and work. 
* I've been going to talk therapy for a long time, I'm trying to move on, it's just really hard!
* I hope for a happier future despite not wanting to take medication for my anxiety and depression.

***Why I'm fearful of and resistant to taking medication for my anxiety and depression:***

* I really struggle at accepting that there is not really one prescribed method to treating anxiety and depression. Therefore, the idea of having to try different cocktails medications that are going to have their own set of side effects until you find something that works really bothers me.
* The medications aren't cures and like any substance, your body builds up a tolerance. Over time, the idea of having to up your dosage or switch drugs to get a similar effect is something I don't like the idea of.
* Even in small doses, I view these medications as powerful drugs. Although they're meant to help, they're not substances you can really stop taking. Sure, you can taper off, but over time your body and mind have become so accustomed to drugs to treat anxiety and depression that it's incredibly difficult to go back to a life of treating anxiety and depression in natural ways, e.g., exercise, mindfulness. I've never heard of any anecdotes of people stopping these drugs for good.
* The side effects! My god. From weight gain to libido impacts to whatever else. And these seems like the softer side effects. Sometimes they can be way worse!
* The time horizon for taking medication. Some people take it for years, few people take it until they level off, stop, and take it again when they need it. There is more research on the long-term use than exploring the short-term application. There is no solid proof that they should be taken for years or decades. Yet, people do. I don't like this idea of never stopping.
* The fact that the science and medical community don't truly have a handle on how to treat depression and anxiety is not reassuring. We've been giving medication to people for so long and the mind is still a mystery. New research debunks old research, new drugs debunk old drugs. It's like one big human test trial until we solve the mysteries of the mind! What the fuck!?
* Lastly, it's the for-profit healthcare industry that really upsets me. I equate being on the pharmaceutical companies' drugs to being a slave to them. You're on the hook and you can't just stop! I don't believe any bullshit story they might say to the public. There busienss is keeping people hooked on their drugs, despite any altruistic core. They need to deliver profits to shareholders, and that's the corporate way. So fuck them, they're ""wolves in sheep's clothing"".

***A little about me***

* I'm a person in my 30s and I have been living with anxiety for most of my life. 
* I remember starting to feel anxious and depressed around 12 years old before I knew what anxious and depressed meant. That's as far as I remember beginning to ideate suicide.
   * At 12 years old is the earliest I remember watching my mother always taking some medication for her anxiety depression and observing that they never quite seem to help her. However, she apparently has been on some kind of medication for at least 15-25 years before (I get different accounts from each parent smdh)
      * It was around this time she was incredibly depressed and anxious. She bet all her money on starting an Internet business that didn't work, so she had no money, her boyfriend and she split up, there was so so soooooo much stress in the home, coupled with fears of homelessness. 
      * I saw her bank receipts with negative balances, stacks of credit cards in her office, the phone never stopped ringing with debt collectors calling, watching her lie on the phone to debt collectors - what the fuck, man!? This is not something a kid should endure.
      * My environment at an early age was not a positive one. And it did not just begin at 12 years old. A negative environment existed even before that e.g., parents divorced, physical punishments - belt on the ass when I was little, horrible memories. So I spent a great portion of my childhood in negative feedback loops.
      * A year ago I asked my mother about this and she said that they've never quite helped her. Jesus, man! A lifetime of giving money to the pharmaceutical companies and it just helped her get by, yet she's still not happy.
* When I was in high school I didn't have any friends for most of it. I was bullied early on for my ethnicity and the way I looked, so I learned to stay out of people's way and not be noticed. It was such a sad and lonely time. Even writing this is really heavy on my heart. 
* I suffered in silence for years. Because of family trouble at home, I didn't feel like I could go to my parents and get help. I was all alone in my anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.
* I started going to therapy in my mid-20s for work stress and it was the beginning of a really deep and shared (w/my therapists) introspective journey. Finally I was able to talk to someone about everything bothering me.
* Therapy helped but always wore off. After 4 years of seeing one therapist I could tell that the good feeling of talk therapy was wearing off, and I was just talking about the same shit. I hit a brick wall, I've done the introspection, but there was no moving on from it.
* I briefly saw a CBT professional and picked up some skills. They can help from time to time.
* Today I still see a great therapist. I really helps to have someone to talk to, and I'm trying to move on from my pain from the past that persists through the present. But there is a frustration because I'm at the point where therapy is just a safe place to vent, but progress to a better life not burdened by my past and coping with anxiety and depressing is very very slow. I'm mindful that this can take years the way it took me years to feel like I've explored everything in my life and mind related to anxiety and depression.
* However, I can get so depressed and anxious at times. I have my good weeks and then stretches of bad weeks.

***What I'm anxious and depressed about***

* Writing this down is always a strange experience because when you write it down it never seems to be as bad as you catastrophize it to be
* Frankly, I'm just unhappy on regular intervals. Even when I'm mindful of all the good things to be thankful for, when I am falling back into a state of depression and anxiety, I am feeling horrible. Crying, anxious, depressed, thinking about suicide.
* There always seems to be this weight of discontentment that's ever present. I'm always so focused on the next thing that I don't appreciate the present. Things often aren't good enough for me when maybe they should be.
* I'm very often sad and burdened by the past, anxious about the present and future, and have this deep fear of being poor and broke like my parents. 
   * A lot of my fear and misery is tied to money unfortunately. Although I've gone out of my way to learn about money, budgeting, and investing, I'm still just always worried about it and that the bottom is going to drop. This is because of growing up in a home with money problems and fears of homelessness.
* The rat race of life and the corporate world really gets me down. 
   * I've been someone that has hated their work (probably like most people), and my work has left me on the spectrum of miserable and traumatized to some degree. 
   * The idea of slaving away for money that's never enough, living in places where it has become too expensive, doing work that's meaningless, I just think, what's the point. 
   * And this is when I ideate suicide. Slogging away for decades more to potentially retire with not enough? 
   * I look at my mother today, she's old, broke, depressed, still has to work - she says she likes to work, which may be true, but she also needs to work - and I know she also ideates suicide (apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it?)
* ***Note about work***: 
   * I'm trying to make a change. 
   * I've left my job and am doing a grad program, but there are plenty of existential crises in a grad program. 
   * What I'm fearful of what's next is this work misery. I'm really focused on trying to find a balance of good work culture while still making good money. 
   * I'm praying to God that the next road is one that is happier, if I can ever be just happier.

***Conclusion***

* Well that's it for now. If you made it here, my forever gratitude for reading my post.
* For those of you providing support, friendly suggestions and guidance, thank you thank you thank you! ",mentalhealth

Basically, one negative outweighs a hundred positives. It's not a simple ""being a bit annoyed"" thing. It really makes me go on a emotional rollercoaster and lose sleep over that. One second I'm ok, the next I'm angry, the next I'm sad, etc. It kicks me out of balance so much that I don't even know *what* to feel in the first place. 

I am self-aware enough to realize that it's a problem, but I can't just ""shut it down"". I really boil on the inside, there are full of (subconscious) emotions going on. So all this ""observe your thoughts"" thing just doesn't work, if you *physically* feel those emotions. I can't simply tell myself ""I'm too entitled for everything"" and boom all those negative emotions are shut down. It's like having a phobia of let's say dogs, and telling yourself ""I don't have to be afraid of them"". So magically, you suddenly don't feel any anxiety around dogs?

I mean, you know these auditory hallucinations just before you fall asleep? What I hear every night are screams of agony. Every day is just about me trying to battle my emotions, and trying to be somewhat emotionally stable. 

On top of all of that, I also think a lot about death, about how I'm wasting my time, about what will come after death, etc. I tried the ""positive nihilist"" outlook (i.e. ""nothing matters, so why do you worry about anything?"") but it makes me feel worse as I can't wrap my mind around a ""meaningless"" life. 

My questions would be: Why am I feeling like that, and what could I do to cope with that?",mentalhealth
1697368551.0,My depression gets worse and I isolated myself from my friends,"First of all I wanna put a trigger warning because I‚Äôm mentioning suicidal thoughts!

Hello, 
I am 18 and in like 6 months I‚Äôll graduate from school. Last week (monday to friday) I was away with my school and now I have two weeks holidays. And before I start I need to add that I know what my family did to me in my childhood was bad and can be considered abuse. They got better and better as I got older but now I feel disconnected to my parents. I love them like distant relatives and I live with them like roommates but I don‚Äôt love them like my parents. 
After I came back I cried for a day. I didn‚Äôt leave my bed, I couldn‚Äôt talk or look at my parents I just cried. My teacher is more like a father to me than my actual father and I was one week with him because he was the teacher we did the school trip with and now I am more dependent on him than before. I already wrote three helplines and my therapist because without help I won‚Äôt survive until November but I didn‚Äôt get an answer yet. I was an asshole to my friends so they won‚Äôt text and I don‚Äôt have the energy to text first because what am I supposed to say? I consider texting my teacher tomorrow or something but I don‚Äôt want to bother him. And friday my family and I go to Croatia for 10 days and then I have school again and have lots of exams and I really consider ending my life because I don‚Äôt want to live like this anymore. I can‚Äôt move out until I start university (in a year) because I don‚Äôt have money and I can‚Äôt start working because then school will be too much.

1697368240.0,What do you think about sharing the details of your self help/therapy with your partner?,"
So the backstory is that me(27F) and my boyfriend(29M) have had a really happy relationship from the beginning (almost a year now) but in the last months I‚Äôve been struggling with my mental health and honestly feeling a bit like I‚Äôm cracking under the (self-imposed) pressure of being in a healthy relationship because most of my relationships, dating and family, have been unhealthy. Partly because of my issues and partly because I was attracted to people with issues and I know it stems from emotional abuse as a child and having to learn everything I know now about healthy communication and love after moving out of my moms house at 18. I‚Äôve come a long way, and what I have with my boyfriend is really good and genuine, but I struggle with self esteem, people pleasing instead of advocating my needs which leads to pent up feelings of neglect, which make me triggered, and then I get reactionary. This was the case for the last month.

Well we talked about it and agreed that‚Äôs not what we want and both took responsibility for our parts in it and expressed we want to work on this. It wasn‚Äôt anything crazy, just a lot of small seriously stupid arguments that would have been avoided with better communication/ expectations and one more emotionally dramatic argument which really was my fault. 

I‚Äôd like to go to therapy but the cost is prohibitive.. so I started with journaling, learning about anxiety, I went on antidepressants a few months ago, and most recently I‚Äôve started reading Codependent No More which is seriously so on point and is really helping my perspective. 

I don‚Äôt know if there is even a right answer to this, but would it be TMI to share with my boyfriend what I‚Äôve learned about myself and what I‚Äôve reflected on from the book and other journaling exercises I‚Äôve done recently? They really get into patterns I‚Äôve experienced in my life and also details of how the current situation with him is triggering my anxiety. The main topics are shame, fear of rejection, and deep rooted insecurities that I‚Äôm bad and don‚Äôt deserve good thing/can‚Äôt keep them, plus where I think they come from and where they‚Äôve come up in my life. So basically a lot of things that an warp one‚Äôs perspective on a relationship. 

He‚Äôs really patient and understanding and I want an intimate, honest relationship but I don‚Äôt want him to identify me with the labels codependency or anxious attachment if it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm actively working to improve‚Ä¶ and I also don‚Äôt want him to feel pressure or guilty because of my baggage, like I‚Äôd never want him to just stay with me just because he knows I have these insecurities and he doesn‚Äôt want to make them worse. 

Id love to hear some thoughts/experiences. Is this something that is helpful to share with your partner or is it better to process these things on my own/with my close friends and then share the solutions I‚Äôve found with him?",mentalhealth
1697367611.0,Is there even a point to fight?,"I don't even know where to begin, i don't even know if i should even write all this, but my life as a whole just starting to make me sick. I'll write down my life story in short, if you want to read it, go ahead, and decide yourself if this shit even makes sense to continue.  
  
I'm a 27 male from a 3rd world country, i moved a few years ago to the Netherlands.  
  
Life with my parents: To start off, i was born from an unloving relationship, my parents wanted to prove to their parents, that they are mature and responsible enough to raise a child. Well, as it turns out, probably that couldn't be further from the truth. All my childhood since i could clean up my own shit i was left alone, maybe i was around 3. My parents were always working, being at a friends place, doing anything else but coming home. They left some food in the fridge from time to time, so i could eat, but most of the time they forgot, so i was eating what i could reach... flour, semolina, sugar, sometimes some vegetables and fruits what we had in the cellar. After i reached the age of 5, they only left money for me, so i had to buy everything for myself, i learned to cook some basic stuff. Starting from this point, they were fighting with eachother constantly, and they were always furious from either work, or from eachothers sheer stupidity, sometimes they tried to vent on me, so i ended up being beaten up almost on a dialy basis, because i couldn't defend myself. When i was around 6, i moved to Germany to my uncle, for about half a year, thoose were the happiest days of my life at that point, but unfortunately his wife died in a car accident, so I ended up back in my own country. When i reached 10 or 11 my parents divorced. I ended up being taken away by my mother, which was a really unfortunate outcome, she was way more agressive than my father was. Up until i reached the age of 14, i was beaten up daily for whatever reason, i was almost strangled to death on multiple occasions, some times i ended up blacking out as well. Some of the reasons included poor performance in school, or she got angry in work, or the wildest ones were when she was dating someone, and they break up with her. When i reached the age of 14 I moved away from home to a school far away from home and lived in a dorm. - When i was around 5 I had an accident, i was cycling with my parents, but i fell under a car, i'm still kind of concerned that it was their doing. I couldn't move for a while, my gall and liver ripped out from their place.  
  
Primary school life: I could never make friends, i never knew what i have to or how i have to talk to people. I never had one single friend in school... or my life. In the meantime while all this happened, i was bullied and beaten up in the school by students and teachers alike. When i reached the age of 13, i got tired of everything, i started beating up people as soon as they tried to get physical with me. The last years of my primary school was spent in either in the principals office, or in a police station. I broke multiple peoples arms, legs, ribs, teeth, etc. I had some bullies move to differrent schools i beaten them up so hard. In the end i got fired, and had to finish the 8th grade from home school. Ah yes and of course when i tried to speak to my parents about the bullying, they said it was my fault, and surprise, i got beaten up.  
  
Studies: I learned reading and writing when i was around 4 or 5 with a help of some school training program on the computer, i was bored out of my mind at home, we had no internet or PC games at the time, only books, and a TV with only 3 commercial channels avaliable. I believe up to high shool i basically learned everything from all the books we had until i was about 8. My parents still had their school books, we had a huge book series that kind of looked like a printed wikipedia. When i reached the age of school, i literally never studied, i slept through classes, it was boring, i already knew everything that they had to teach me. Since they bullied the heck out of me, a bunch of times i couldn't even finish my tests for all kinds of reasons. They broke my pen, ripped up my paper, once they stabbed me with a compass, etc.  
  
High school: After i moved far far away from my parents, i started to work in a factory or for the military, depending on which one needed help on specific weekend days, or afternoons in the school. During vacations i was working full shifts. My years in high school were kind of chill, i never made friends, but i already had a huge build from all the physical work i was doing, so no one dared to pick on me, they said i looked dangerous and socially distant. I found love after a year, she was the love of my life, we finished the school together, and moved together right after.  
  
Doctors and other shit: I was forced to visit doctors all the time, i was diagnostized with ADHD, Autism, and a lot of other mental shit.  
  
Love life: We were together for 8,5 years, i was helping her in everything, i helped her with money, she originally came from a really poor family. When we finished school we lived off my salary for about 1,5 years, because she couldn't find work in the area. After school, we got engaged, but eventually, she just packed her stuff, blocked me on everything, and left. She was my everything, i planned my life around her, we basically grew up together. This was 5 years ago.  
  
Work life: After school, I started off at a building engineering company as a simple salesman. The CEO quickly noticed that i was super smart, and i remembered almost everything about every product we had, and after the first month my probation ended, and i could do everything my own, i increased my departments sales by 10 times. After that point i got promoted as an Online Sales Manager, but they kept my salary incredibly low, despite the huge jump in responsibility. This went on for almost 5 years, but i gave up. They asked me to study law, which i did for 1,5 years, and we agreed that my salary will increase accordingly, this ofc. did not happened. I left the company, and since they did not knew how to operate everything what i had build during thoose years, they got into a huge lawsuit, loosing millions in the first few weeks after i left. After i left, i tried to look for something in my own country, but i gave up after 3 months.

  
I moved to the Netherlands, to try my luck. In the past 2 years I'vbeen moving from company to company, since they prefer polish people in every possible position where i worked so far. At the moment i would say i'm on a good place, but who knows.  
  
During all theese years, i never made a single friend, i could never recover from my ex, i never had my own dreams, i have nothing to work for, just my own survival. Since i'm in the Netherlands, I live with alcoholics, drug addicts, and criminals in a workers hostel. I don't know how to talk to people, i don't know how to make friends, i don't know how to find love again. I have no clear point in my life, but survival. I have to work to survive, to buy food.

  
I tried multiple hobbies, and they always gave me a boost, but after a while my interest died towards almost all of them.

  
I'm trying to loose some weight, by going to the gym, since i'm eating a lot of trashfood, and sweets, and sometimes it feels like thats my only way to increase my dopamine levels by a little. As soon as my dopamine levels drop all i'm thinking about is suicide. I have no clear image in my mind, i don't have anything that i want to accomplish, i wish i was a millionare so i can see the world, but i feel like i can't do anything to change anything. I feel like the only thing i can do is escape from my past and country, and live a miserable life in a faraway land, and be a slave for the rest of my life, without friends, love, or a place that i can truly call my home. Even just the thought of this makes me sick. My life is miserable and i feel like i can't do anything to change it, nor do i have the strenght to continue like this. I just want to end it all.

I've gone to therapy over the last 15 years to try to stay healthy and manage depression/anxiety/anger issues but it's so much.

There's just always problems, never ending fires to put out, always having to put my needs second or ignore them. I just lost the ability to cope. Maybe my point of view is so poisoned because of the never ending problems just made it so that a positive outlook can't materialize.

1697366721.0,Anyone else who was misdiagnosed with autism as a child?,"So, what happened to me is that I was diagnosed with autism when I was about 10 years old. The diagnosis never really felt right. Then when I was twenty, I asked for a re-assessment and the conclusion was that I did not have autism after all, which to me was a huge relief. 

I was wondering if there are other people who have been in the same situation? I would love to hear from you. I never really told any of my friends about the autism diagnosis, because people can start treating you differently because of it. And then when the autism diagnosis was removed, I still didn't tell them for the same reason. It would be nice to talk with other people who've had this same experience - online and anonymously.

1697365855.0,I feel like I'm a lie. Am I experiencing some form of depersonalization?,"As in the title, I feel like my self is a lie, that behind the sack of meat that is my body there is no true person. I feel like I'm a layer of contradicting masks, constructed to fit whatever personality is appropriate at the moment. But I can't peel the layers back, there is no source and i feel im lying to everyone every time i speak with them. I also barely remember most of my past, especially my childhood, it's just a garbled mess of hazy events that I mostly just know in the abstract. I know I went to school, but I barely remember being there. All I remember was feeling rejected, lonely, wrong and praying for death.

I think it was then, in 1st or 2nd grade, when I started hiding who I was, and now I can't remember who that was, maybe there's just nothing now. Usually I just chug along, not even realizing I lie, and doing things without thinking, going through the motions. But sometimes, it's like I snap back, and I feel like I'm watching a movie, like someone else is doing things while I'm a passenger in their head. There were times, in the past, where I looked in the mirror and wondered ""huh, so that's supposed to be me?"" 

And it makes me so fucking scared to be close to people, especially romantically. I mean, what can I give them if I'm nothing but a series of lies? Who would want to stay with someone that's nothing, just some mirage of an individual. I dread the idea of opening up, because I've only done that a select few times in my life, when I was at my absolute breaking point. I dread it because I've gotten used to this hiding and deceiving, and I don't know what else to do, I don't even know what side I'd show someone if they wanted to be with the ""real me"".

They had a huge impact on my mental health, and I'm not sure if it's a side effect or some kind of interaction.

at first they gave me some undesirable things like maladaptive day dreaming, and severe hypomania. That went away when I was done with one of the three medications, but now I'm in such a great place mentally. I'm happy without the bad parts of hypomania. I can feel emotions. I actually want to be around people. I don't feel the need to mask my emotions.

I've gotten to know my neighbors for the first time. I don't feel awkward around people. I've made friends. I feel comfortable talking to people I'm attracted to. I feel like what I imagined a happy neurotypical person would feel. I'm finally the kind of person I would want to be around.

Im sorry that im about to type a lot but its just something i really would like to understand about my mental state. My names Joseph and im 17, im male and i have a big problem with figuring out what is wrong with me. to get to the point, i have sexual thoughts about anything. being honest, i really dont find any of the thoughts arousing, but they have been getting worse and worse, which has been a problem for almost a year. to get this out of the way, im attracted to feet and ive always been very insecure about it, even though ever since i was 13 i would act out on it, looking up teen feet, noone 2 years younger than me though, i was very strict about that. in real life, id get very nervous if someone was barefoot, hoping i dont show any signs, even to my own fucking family which made me look awkward. but the end of last year was different. my brother, whod always snoop through what i searched, knew i liked feet and i always pretended like he never knew. around me he would say ‚Äúmy feet really hurt..‚Äù and pose his feet to get a reaction out of me? he shows interest in making rap songs, and not too long ago, i realized some were about me. one of the lyrics had ‚Äúhes just starin‚Äô at it‚Äù ‚Äúi dont want your love, you dont know what love is‚Äù and ‚Äúyou showed your true colors‚Äù which had me thinking a lot. i started thinking he thought i was attracted to his feet, but i swear i wasnt, i was too focused on not looking at him in a weird way that would make him think that. but why would he say im staring at it when in reality that was the very thing i tried to avoid? when by myself, i would video my eyes focused on one thing, while also trying to move it at the same time, but i would never really see my eyes move. i was talking with my step father 1 on 1 about how i thought my brother was making music about me, trying to ‚Äúcalm me down‚Äù. it was all good until he started showing intimidation. ‚Äúoh shoot theres a cop right there, oh never mind, it‚Äôd be funny if i had friend who was a cop.‚Äù while he looked me as if i did something wrong. i felt as if he thought i did something pedophilic, which made me look nervous after what he thought about me, which just made my ass look guilty as fuck. my other brother, whod also shown interest in making music, would rap about ‚Äúits sad, but ill get over it‚Äù ‚Äújust like he know thats my girl, chill, chill, chill‚Äù ‚Äúif he was like that id know he‚Äôd lie‚Äù. my biggest fear before all of this was people knowing i like feet, but now they think i like little kids? im living in a nightmare. after a year of this, i feel so use to it that i dont really show how much i care. our grandma recently just passed away, and i showed no emotion at her funeral, even though we talked everyday, and we were very close. at her funeral i was still very nervous showing up, hoping i dont act weird. me and my brothers took pictures together, and this one picture, taken on my moms phone, will haunt me for the rest of my life. my left eye was staring at the camera, the right at my brother. seeing it for myself, hoping i was the only one who saw it, i deleted it as fast as i could. to this day i feel very uncomfortable about it and never wanna be in public again, knowing i had a lazy eye and worst of all, it eases to something i really wish to not look at, which gets worse the more i dont wanna look at something. i wanna say that my eye problem started a year ago, when i would be too focused on something i didnt wanna look at, but again i didnt even know my eye was doing that, whilst my family thought i did it intentionally. after looking through reddit about ocd, i started thinking positive, but it makes me angry at the same time, because if it is ocd, no one could have made it as worse as it is than my own family. they had me thinking more and more i was actually a pedophile and incest, when all it really was was ocd(not diagnosed, i just believe it to be). they told me i was in a phycosis, my mother sent me to foster care, which i feel is gods way of giving me space away from them, giving me time to heal and think. in the end, when i do heal, i have no plans to keep in contact with my real family which is sad. id alway say the reason i live is to make my family happy, but now they think im a monster. suicide has been on my mind, no intent, i guess its just another intrusive thought. i have a lot more to live being 17, with alot of musical talents and ending it like this feels very unsettling. a tiny part of me is thankful im going through this, because i know it sure as hell made me more matured, knowing the only one who can make me happy is me, and i have to live with that mindset. the way i grew up makes me cringe at emo/edgy depressing comments, but now that im going through it, talking about how i really feel is hard. so sorry for this, but to this day, nothing makes me truly happy right now, which is me being depressed i guess, struggling with a lot of mental illness and anger. i want to get into boxing. i feel theres a lot i could do with my anger. all of my intrusive thoughts, but im never aroused except for female feet which i havnt really been as insecure as i was, compared to what my family thinks about me. i really do plan on getting help about my intrusive thoughts, since much is offered, being in foster care, the problem is just talking about it. after looking through what everyone has to say about other peoples problems, i feel i could find some info on here as to why i have these thoughts and why theyve gotten worse. i know i should just ask my therapist about it but i just want advice from other people who can support me instead of just laughing and seeing me as weak and digusting. please someone help me. give me advice and reassurance. it feels like im at my lowest and i really need it. 

I also only a few questions, if anyone can answer it, id appreciate it so fucking much.

1. Why does my lazy eye only look at things i try to not look at?
2. Why do i feel normal going through this? I do feel really hurt and disgusted and eat very little now, but i feel like i should be throwing up everyday, slowly killing my head and body.
3. I know i said i dont feel aroused by any of the intrusive thoughts, but why do you think theyve gotten worse?",mentalhealth

1697363189.0,I am emotionally drained.,"TW

Also I am not trying to self diagnose I just don't know how else to word these things in a way people will understand. 

I went through a very rough period in my life a few years back and only now am I coming to the terms with the fact that I was suffering a really bad depressive episode. I am not saying this is the reason but one of the many, prior to my depressive episode I lost many people I cared about, was dealing with my parents fighting most nights and coming to terms with childhood trauma that had come back to me. During this time I had planned out many attempts and tried to go through it once but life got in the way. Now I feel I am facing the after affects of coming out of the episode which I'm not even sure is a thing. I think these 'after affects' may be based on how I handled my episode since the only way I i could handle it was to mentally numb my emotions.

My depression ended in a numbed state where I didn't cry or feel sad for almost a year. During my depression I went through stages of numbness as well but it wasn't as bad as it was when my depression ended but to be honest I didn't care. I felt so happy I was glad I had numbed myself. Like I had forcefully removed the bad emotions and all I had left was some twisted version of happiness - euphoria more so. 

After that the new year started and both the depression and the numbness slowly disappeared but I was left to grapple having my real emotions back. For a while I was fine but fights I had had with my parents got worse and I decided I wanted to change so I found myself meeting new people. One of these people I formed a romantic attachment with but I was no where near ready for a relationship. They pushed me into a situation where me and the person were romantically envoled even though I didn't want it. 

I wasn't able to communicate this properly, however, and maybe it was a craving for attention or wanting to feel love for the first time in years, I went along with it. This lead to another downpour in my mental health where I was treating this person and others in my life really poorly through what I can only describe as a bad case of BPD or something similar. I would ghost and love bomb and start fights. My emotions would switch up really quickly and I was scared that even though I knew I was treating everyone badly, they'd leave me. 

I started to self harm again and my anger levels was getting out of hand. Eventually I think they got sick of me so even though we weren't dating as I specially asked not to label us, they sent me a 'break up' text. My mood swings and anger stayed for a while until I was finally done with everyone I had met. Only then did I start to feel as if everything was going back to normal. Sometimes I still experience pretty bad mood swings towards the people from my past. I want attention from them for a day then get annoyed when they want to keep in touch.

This all ended the start of this year and I finally thought I was getting back on track with my mental health until now. I have found my myself mirroring people's emotions, especially the when they are stressed or angry or sad and I feel so drained from it I cant even function. I don‚Äôt know whether its a coping mechanism or something what i just cant handle it. On top of that I fear I may have developed some sort of anxiety and I have a need to do everything right and even the slightest rejection or if I do something wrong and I am corrected, I end up holding in my tears and feeling an immense sadness. I have been experiencing random spikes in my anger, only narrowly catching myself before i physically and mentally hurt the people i care about. The slightest bit of rejection can set me off and I can feel heavily depressed for the next few days. I cannot go into more details because I honestly don't know how to explain it but I just feel so drained at the moment and I don't know what to do.",mentalhealth

1697359869.0,How do I stop my constant seperation anxiety? Need help.,"TW: Suicidal thoughts

Hello.

The last 3 weeks or so have been the hardest of my [20M] entire life. The person I love the most has gotten in to a relationship and I have had really bad depression, seperation anxiety, jealousy, and my libido and appetite have both been gone. I barely get enough sleep. I also got an anxiety attack a few nights ago. For context, I have autism, don't use any drugs or take any medication.

It has become so bad that when the gf of my friend joins or gets mentioned, I feel a ""bomb"" of anxiety exploding in my body. And my heart starts throbbing. 

In general for the past few weeks, I go to bed shaking and with a throbbing heart, barely sleep, and wake up the same way: with a throbbing heart. Throughout most of the day it stays, I just feel it throbbing constantly, and I even see my throat pulsing in the mirror. I also regularly think of suicide, I am however not in danger, as I will not act upon these thoughts.

How do I calm these symptoms? I imagine sooner rather than later it's gonna wreck my body. And how do I get my mind off of her when I constantly think of her? I'm heartbroken and lost. I don't want to cut ties with her because she is my world and only one of very few social contacts.

If you're reading this and any bit of advice comes to mind, please comment it. I am lost and need help really badly, my life is becoming unbearable.",mentalhealth

How are things in there? Is it as horrible as people say it is? Maybe i just don't want to admit that i can't do this alone cause i was always thaught to always do things myself and never ask for help, that i should be perfecto, do things the perfecto way, never making mistakes and everything in me is a mistake, how can i live a good life if i'm broken?

Tried to commit suicide in 2021 whilst in the military was given 10 weeks CBT and denied access to further treatment by the MOD so I left. My fiance told me to stop being silly with my mental health and can‚Äôt understand why I still have PTSD or bad mental health days since I have left the military. I support their view as we all deserve our opinions to be heard and understood. 

I am still suicidal and each time I think about it, I almost feel like I‚Äôm waiting on the train to come one day. But I have my first child on the way and I can‚Äôt commit suicide as my life insurance won‚Äôt pay out, this is vital to my child‚Äôs future and my fianc√© as it‚Äôs sizeable at ¬£500k. 

Along with this my fianc√© dosent like sharing a bed with me and we sleep in separate rooms, she says it‚Äôs for her own benefit as I don‚Äôt sleep well and when I do I speak in my sleep and wake myself up with some of the memories I have. This has a effect on me as it plays on my mind why I am not good enough to be around but I also know it‚Äôs all my fault and it‚Äôs part of my journey struggling to come to terms that I am the issue. 

I went to the NHS for help and was told I‚Äôll be on a waiting list which I understand is fair as there is others ahead of me who need more help, particularly those who aren‚Äôt comfortable with the idea of dying and have a harder time wrestling their mental health. I suppose I‚Äôm lucky I have accepted I‚Äôm hated and my passing has no impact in the world even for those close to me, seen people lose their life‚Äôs and a flag was all they came to be. 

I just wanted to vent as I can‚Äôt complain really I have accepted I‚Äôm beyond helping and I‚Äôm pushing to build wealth for my family when I pass. I just feel stuck in limbo that I know I‚Äôll die and abit of me is still sad that I am not loved by my own fianc√© anymore and I‚Äôll never be the father to my child I want to be.

1697357899.0,I‚Äôm stuck like this and I need help,"Hello to anyone who reads this, I hope your having a good day and am not experiencing what I am. 
Just as a background for this. For about 5 years now. Ive been in so many bad experiences that I‚Äôve convinced myself it‚Äôs normal and to follow the mindset. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll survive‚Äù. 
I‚Äôve always been the guy that isn‚Äôt really the popular or guy that people end up crushing on. Im the guy who ends up like an older brother, there to help no matter what. A guy you can trust and talk to, so that you can find your way through a problem. But that makes it so that I‚Äôm not really the one who gets help. 
See I‚Äôve been just beating myself up recently. All the people, my friends. Around me are all in happy relationships, not me. I‚Äôve helped about 5 of my crushes now, get with their guy. Who just so happens to be my friend. I don‚Äôt sabotage them at all because I don‚Äôt want to manipulate anyone into anything. I just want them to be happy and it‚Äôs all I really care about. I don‚Äôt really get texted or spoken too much outside of when I usually see the people. Their friendly and I consider them friends. I have a shell around me that‚Äôs kinda like a mask that says I‚Äôm fine. Or I have no emotions are what some other people who don‚Äôt know me say. But to get to the point.
 Im lonely, it‚Äôs been getting to me. Ive grown deceptive of everything and I investigate everything as a habit now. I don‚Äôt feel included in anything. Some people who i think of as friends don‚Äôt invite me places, but I ignore it and invite them places anyways. They don‚Äôt text me, I can usually go about a week or two without being texted first by anyone. But I‚Äôll live, all I have now is hope. Hope that things will get better. And I think in order for things to do that I need people who can maybe help me through this which is why I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm putting my trust into people I‚Äôve never met before, because I know people here can really bring back my hopes and dreams. 
I lost my hopes, dreams, ambitions to everything because of my mental health. I used to be a near 4.0 student, now I‚Äôm about a 2.8-3 . I don‚Äôt talk much verbally, I‚Äôve lost my fears in things but at the cost of it‚Äôs because I just don‚Äôt care anymore. I still want to not be alone. But I also want to help people. Helping is what makes me feel included and needed and good. I feel good that people trust me and that I can really do something to help them get out of their depression or dark moments. 
I was in a car driving this girl home from a football game. I had a crush on her, but to her I‚Äôm a older brother. And she started crying. I ask her what was wrong, and she was questioning why anyone liked her and it broke my heart. And I had to explain to her every reason someone would like her. Then she brought up the guy she liked who was my friend. I was sad but I just wanted to help her get better. That‚Äôs the type of guy I am. 
People tell me I‚Äôm a guy who people just happen to feel trusted towards and I w always end up like a brother. 
But I want to also experience the things they do, I want love, I want to be invited places, I want to go on a date (I was cancelled on one the day of the date which would have been my first, I even got a haircut and expensive clothing and my parents were excited for me). But I also want to keep helping people. That‚Äôs all I can really think of, it‚Äôs 3 am right now and I haven‚Äôt slept. Sorry if I repeated anything, but thank you if you read this all. If you have any advice or just want to help I welcome it. I hope you have a nice day.",mentalhealth

It's kinda sad that I want that again someone who I would do anything for. Fuck. I kinda feel pathetic for writing this I mean who am I writing it for. Why would anyone care about my problems. My chest feels tight. Like I know what I want to say but it's stuck. Even now with complete anonymity and I still can't say what I want because of what people will think. How they would feel towards me even though you don't know who I am. I don't know if I want anyone to feel anything towards me. It's not like I don't want attention. I keep thinking am I doing this for pity. So  many contradictions in my head.,mentalhealth

1697354134.0,Friends Forever,"A short story inspired by very real events

I met ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù when we both joined an online mental health support group. From her profile picture, I could tell she‚Äôd been through a lot for a 36 year old. Sarah was bald, very overweight and she used oxygen. She also now had a bipolar disorder diagnosis and so did I (I was diagnosed in 1999).

I didn‚Äôt expect that Sarah would feel up to posting much, but she did, and she was wickedly funny. We hit it off right away. It wasn‚Äôt long before we exchanged phone numbers and soon we were chatting nearly every day. Often we‚Äôd FaceTime so we could see each other‚Äôs faces and share our lives.

We became so close so fast that I felt like I had known Sarah all my life. I learned that she had diabetes, an underactive thyroid, scarred lungs and she had beaten a battle with breast  cancer. I was amazed by her and her strength. I began confiding in her and it wasn‚Äôt long before I was planning a trip to her city.

One day Sarah didn‚Äôt show up to post in our support group, like she had every day. I left her several messages there and later tried her phone but got no answer. I figured she‚Äôd contact me when she had a moment.

Two days went by with no word from her. I got worried, but since I hadn‚Äôt visited, we‚Äôd met online and she lived about 1000 miles away from me, I hadn‚Äôt had a chance to visit. I had no one from her family to contact or any other friends who knew her.

I never heard from Sarah again. I missed her terribly and couldn‚Äôt quite believe she had ghosted me, but eventually of course I went on with my life

Three months later, I got a call from a strange number. I don‚Äôt usually answer those, but this time something (God?) told me to answer. It was a woman who asked my name and then asked me if I knew her daughter Sarah.

I told her absolutely I did and that I was so glad she‚Äôd called because Sarah and I had lost touch. I asked her how she had gotten my number and she told me from Sarah. She then started crying and my heart fell to the floor.

‚ÄúSarah‚Äôs cancer has come back, hasn‚Äôt it.‚Äù I was so upset that I started shaking.

‚ÄúNo. Sarah died by suicide a month ago,‚Äù her mom finally choked out. 

I was stunned. I couldn‚Äôt form words. Sure, Sarah and I were both bipolar, and had talked about her other illnesses too, but she was so strong and funny and friendly!

I said, ‚ÄúI thought you told me Sarah had given you my number.‚Äù She said, ‚Äúshe did, in a roundabout way. I found it in her phone when I got it back from Verizon and got access to it. I read through your messages and realized you were a close friend.‚Äù I confirmed I was and gave her a brief rundown of our friendship.

She then said, ‚ÄúPlease tell me about my daughter.‚Äù 

I spent the next hour and a half telling her everything her daughter and I had shared. We both cried. There were a lot of things she didn‚Äôt know about her life in recent years (after all, Sarah was 36 and living on her own). 

As Sarah‚Äôs mental health apparently declined,  she had withdrawn from her family. I was completely surprised because Sarah told me she was close to her family. Plus she was always smiling and funny and upbeat when we spoke or FaceTimed. Her mother explained to me that Sarah had always hidden the worst parts of her mental and physical illnesses and she had even died quietly by overdosing on her insulin.

She told me, ‚Äúwe do have reason to believe she tried to change her mind at the last minute. She was found with an unlit cigarette in her mouth just steps from the outside door to her apartment building. We think she was going to ask someone for help by getting a light from someone outside and asking for help. But her blood sugar bottomed out and she collapsed.‚Äù

I was so heartbroken when I hung up the phone. I couldn‚Äôt believe that such a vibrant soul was gone from the world. I couldn‚Äôt believe that my life had been touched by suicide when I myself was bipolar and also a crisis counselor. 

I decided I needed to do something, anything to remember her by. At that time I ran a Facebook page called the Empathetrix on which I posted my inspirational collage art for my 16,000 followers. I decided to do one for Sarah. It depicted a little girl headed towards a white light with a backpack on that says,‚ÄùI am in pain.‚Äù Nearby an angel statue weeps and the flowers are wilted. Sarah ran for that, whatever it is; I‚Äôm still not sure. But I‚Äôm sorry, Sarah. I wish I‚Äôd known.",mentalhealth

Bother and I had good times. Most were bad. All were toxic.
busted through the wall with a shot glass in his hand. Scream  ""TAKE THE SHOT"" . I took the shot. Many times went to school absolutely shit-faced. Reached out for help, didn't want to touch it. High school=difficult. Grades dropped to nothing. I had zero respect. Commit injustice towards me, I was on a vindictive path towards you and yours. Fought others to protect friends. Felt like Captive Princess, The White Knight and The Dragon.


Homeless at 16, had my driver's license and a Ford explorer. dropped out, worked for a temp agency, paid every day. Was happy.
Friends no longer associate with me because I dropped out
Went back 3X. Graduated 21.
I cut family.  Incredibly angry. Hatred/resentment.
Life was difficult, chaotic. Hardly downtime. When there was I was foolish. Caught flat-footed and off guard.

 Martyr, atoning for mistakes made. Magnet to the damned. Life had become cumbersome. No running. No escape.

 Friend suffered incredible loss. Cared very deeply for him. Acted the hero. I did it because I cared. I was his only support. After a year he fell in love with me. 
 Relationship I was in became a transactional/maintenance relationship. No emotional attachment. He would use money as a replacement
 Still wanted to be loved and I still loved. I still cared. Too far wrapped up, take on others emotional. Drunk in the kitchen floor off cheap whiskey. Incredibly depressed. Unmotivated, no ambition no imagination. Essentially a shell.
 My friend realized and helped me/forced me? Out of the relationship, in a really fucked up way. I was told if I do not get in a relationship with him he would refuse to be my friend. Only person I had left, could not let him go. I told him that he is making a mistake, and that I am a incredibly difficult individual to be around. Told him he would regret it.
We are still together. 
Life was fantastic, 2 years. Damn near perfect. Going the way I had imagined. Still struggled, not as severe. Outlook was better, colors brighter. Trauma happened.
 Put on  (meds) that I Complete stop, no weaning.  LCSW convinced me to go to inpatient. They wanted to put me on med*Cost too high. Started talking to fam.

Shortly it's May 5th, Getting better. Calming down.
Work in a warehouse taking pictures of clothing and putting it online. I get to work on May 5th 2023 at 7:25am. Go on break at 9:58a, pass a guy on the stairs in blue jeans, a hoodie, work boots and a hat. Think nothing, even say ""excuse me"". Looked like he belonged. One of us. Then I heard the gunshots.
 He ******* my boss and himself. She had broken up a month before, kidnapped her 2 weeks before that day. 60 seconds has ever felt so staged. Everything changed.


 May 5th - October 14th
3 ish weeks later, think I was her? Pretty sure I existed, but Deja Vu daily, unsure and doubtful  if I was in the right area or the right time. I broke. Days I couldn't speak. I couldn't form full sentences. 
Distraught. Body trying to rip apart, exist on multiple planes. Disassociated, shackled to myself. Went back to work for almost a week. Everyday a panic attack. Had to fight me to go inside.
 I forgot how to take pics, could 't comprehend typing. Listing rate from 42 a day to 6. Intense Emotional outbursts. Like the wrath of a terrible god at work, home. Brother started hanging out at our place. 
Anger was rage, the power of hell behind it. It would be lit by anything at any time. Completely over the top. Like a flash fire. Instantaneous, hot as the Sun.
Everyone was a victim. Caught in flame. Lashed out, burning everything and everyone. Used what I knew to tear you apart. We fire took over,  I was pushed backwards, forced to watch it destroy. No power, no control over this monster. 
Shattered into pieces every day. At night I put myself back together. 
Sometimes last for a couple hours, sometimes days. Anger subsided, was exhausted, cannibalizing myself. Feelings of extreme guilt and shame. Couldn't live up to my own extreme expectations; hated myself. I was fallible, susceptible. Mortal.
Couldn't accept it.
 Struggled a month. Watched my life burn to the ground. Brother and I got high. Different kinds. Not sure what I did or didn't do.I feel bad for saying no, wil give him everything he wants just to avoid a fight. Neglected my everything. Health, hygiene everything. Became impulsive, participating in risky behaviors. Overindulgent with everything. Philosophy losophy became, ""I will do what I want"". No care for anyone else, consideration and empathy, gone. Bullshit threshold screwed.
 Current relationship almost ended ( financial stuff that had also happened in that time frame.)


 A month since I kicked brother out. Something said ""Enough""  I'
Not sure what snapped me out. A switch was flipped. Currently  working w/m therapist, specialist EMDR. 
Seen him a few times. Therapy is exhausting. It hurts. From years ago. Stuff I never worked through/out.
Once a week. Every session, I feel everything. Same feeling, Same pain. Years apart. After, I'm numb. No energy to feel.


Currently struggling with anger, fear. Recall memory falling. Response time delayed, info comp speed slowed. Feel confusion, difficulty doing tasks. Lose focus,lose thought. Intense need for organization, to my standard. I have terrible nightmares,wake up fighting. (Prazosin can't remember nightmare but feel the effects)
Paranoid, world is out for me. Waiting for life upended. This is not my universe/not my world.
 Waiting for the other shoe.
Feel as a mimick/chameleon. Different hats/suits for specific situations. Think emotional states put on at any time, but ca to remove. A back seat view me dealing with whatever.
I feel ike a puzzle with no outline. I have the pieces, but I don't have a reference of what it's supposed to be or where they go.
Being Underwater,  murky and thick. RInging in my ears,  far away and high pitched


I feel extreme guilt. For my boss, my coworkers. Failed in being the defender, the saviour. Blinded and could not see a threat right in front of my face. Guilt For every time I had an episode or internal fight . Guilt for being. Shame, worthless. Not enough, never will. Hyper self-critical, beat myself down.
Feel 5 mindsets here with me. A child, a caregiver, a trickster, a numb individual, a demon/pure destruction. 
Myself, single weed in the side walk. Resilient and just ""being"".


Body full of tar,  thick, non-moving. Difficult to breathe.
On edge. Wound too tight. Tightrope walker.
Not comfortable in my skin. Consciousness forcibly transferred 'here and now'. An imposter. A chameleon.
 Became cynical, pessimistic, angry. Hate people. Need connection. Love to help, hate to resent. Blame myself, critize. Tear my self down.
A perpetual Victim. The Victimizer and The Rescuer. I get angry at myself,being weak. Everyday, I'm crazy, am an idiot. Should have known better. Should have been smarter. Hate for anxious, depressed. Am chaos incarnate, existence meant for unpredictable disaster.
A sandstorm in my head, never stops. Buildings far out few.
 Can't grasp recent ideas or memories. Intelligence is waning. I   Intuition works. Sixth Sense for danger. Doesn't tell me when, where, who, what, why. Cant see immediately in front. See  hazard three blocks away, not the hole a foot in front of me. Naive. 
A walking contradiction. Disorganized Perfection. Intelligent and stupid. Kind and hateful. Need connection, hate people.


 At times, I  have complete clarity. Able to breathe. OG me freed
I don't know who that is. How to tell. Its pulled beneath the surface, and it's gone. I am stuck in fog with a terrible and familiar monster.
Tired and exhausted. Trying to understand if it's real. 
Mind is racing a million miles an hour, abrasive, hurts to obtain information. 


I think I know who I WAS. An empathetic, kind, deeply caring, person who yearned for emotional connection and physical  touch/Love.
I'm not sure what I am now. Am I even a human being anymore?",mentalhealth
1697352894.0,Having suicidal thoughts and questioning my worth,"I hate talking about this publicly but my family doesn‚Äôt believe in mental health and I just really would appreciate some advice.

i‚Äôm currently 16 and just started my junior year. I‚Äôve had anxiety, socially and generally for as long as I can remember, but since high schools started it‚Äôs spiraled for me. This year specifically has been kicking my ass. Classes and everything, sure; but the lack of people, friends,  I have in my life for emotional support has been getting to me. My dad doesn‚Äôt support my anxiety; i‚Äôve taken medication and therapy in the past and he doesn‚Äôt think I have it, that i‚Äôm over dramatic. Depression has also developed strongly for me since freshman year, but since last year I find myself thinking about ending my life as a passing thought more frequently. I cry almost every school night because I don‚Äôt want to deal with my classmates nor the stress of being there. I don‚Äôt have anything to look forward to, so why should I go?
The thing is, I got with my current boyfriend 3 months ago. It‚Äôs been absolutely wonderful and he‚Äôs a joy to be with, and a ray of sunshine in every sense. He‚Äôs super happy go lucky, never really upset or anything, all in all he‚Äôs just positive for himself and those around him. Me being the opposite has made me question my worth. Every argument we have I sob in fear that this won‚Äôt turn out. My codependency on him has made me so unstable. He makes me so happy, but without him I feel empty. It‚Äôs not healthy. I want to change, but I have no source to, I don‚Äôt know how. It makes me a problematic partner and I hate it because I want to be the best I can be for him. He‚Äôs aware of all of my issues but this is still a neverending stressed for me.
IMy dad has been especially on me for a lack of a job. For clarification im a straight A student and just dropped out of APUSH because I was so overwhelmed with stress. He‚Äôs been on me ever since, and when I tell him I need to focus on my academics he just yells at me and ignores the fact I also have major anxiety. I never vent to him about anything anymore because I know I‚Äôll get yelled at.
This is so much. If anyone could give a few reassuring words I‚Äôd be eternally grateful. Im just lost and questioning if I should be here. I have no sources of comfort so Im looking to here.",mentalhealth

I don‚Äôt do the bad things but I feel the NEED for validation or my whole days ruined. I have this boss that was once my friend. He treated me like a friend, was all great. One week we barely worked together and I fell apart a little bit mentally because of that. The next time I worked with him another technician he had been working with was also working with us. That really upset me, threw apart my whole day. Just because that got in my head that he treated everyone the same as he treated me. Why am I like this?

1697352228.0,Question about the voices in my head,"Okay , I don't really know if this is the right place to ask, but when I was 8 years old I would randomly get voices in my head telling me to do something extremely bad which I can't say on here and it would be constant and nonstop to the point I wouldn't go to bed or ask my mom to sleep next to me and to make sure no one would fall asleep before I could, I would start sobbing when these would happen, my breathing would get heavier I would have panic attacks. There was a time where it happened for 5 hours straight and I was up till 8 am sobbing and crying and my mom stayed up with me till then not sure what to do. My cousins would try to help me calm down because  these voices would come at random times and it would freak me out a lot, there was a time I went outside shopping and these voices suddenly started again and I started freaking out and panic crying to the point my dad was trying to rush back home in the car and I kept on sobbing in the car freaking out. I would watch a lot of horror movies uncensored because my whole family was a horror lover but they did warn and tell me not to watch it at that time since I was a child but I was stubborn and refused to listen to what they'd tell me. I think it may have been environmental? Because the last time I experienced these voices was when I was 15. These voices would get really bad telling me to do extremely awful things and practically force me but I knew I couldn't because I had good tolerance to handle it tho there would be time where I'd hold my head in my hands begging it to stop.  I'm now 17 and I haven't experienced it since then, but I do get sleep paralysis at times, tho I don't think that's the same thing.

1697352117.0,I'm not sure what happens... wondering if someone has a clue,"Hello everyone, I'm posting because I genuinely don't have another idea... I've asked around for advice but people tend to just look at me as if I'm crazy. I'm a freshman collage student, and I've never exactly had good experiences with school, it's always linked to Incrediblely bad memories... it started off early on in elementary school.  I'm not sure if this is connected to what I'll mention next, but there have been some moments I can't fully understand or explain, and people don't seem to understand when I tell them. One of the earliest to provide as an example was when I was ten, It would feel like seconds that I was sitting at the desk, staring into the faux wood design on the surface before fingers would snap in front of me, the ""seconds"" would turn out to be several minutes. I was diagnosed with ADHD early on, but some things that happened later I'm not sure follow it- not really asking for medical advice more so just a clue on where to even get ideas for what's happening. One time when I was around 7, I was at recess and there was this bug on the ground- I picked this isopod up and held it... before I knew it a teacher grabbed be by my arm yelling at me, apparently I had sat there bug in hand for an hour and the class had left me. But I didn't have a single clue time had passed that much, infact I didn't understand why she was so angry. Events weirder than this happened later down the line, I had a 504 in middle school given my severe ADHD... so I carried my entire book bag everywhere I went regardless of schools policy's. One day after lunch I had forgotten literally everything I needed in the cafeteria, so I went back for it. The moment I picked up my back pack I realized... I didn't know where I was going, who's class I was going to, I was completely and utterly clueless. Halfway through the entire school year, I suddenly didn't have a clue where I needed to be. I went to the office and nervously got there attention.. I told them I was lost. They just... stared at me, eventually one asked me what class I had during that time. I nervously said I didn't know, they next asked for my teachers name. I stuttered as I realized the fact I didn't have a clue, I knew before- I knew this information before but it deserted me completely... The only thing I could think to do is apologize as I repeated ""I'll remember"" A few times. The staff member must have seen my face because she asked for my name next. I gave her my name close to tears not having a clue what was happening and why this information had left me. She searched my schedule and eventually I was on my way to the class having missed a full 30 minutes of class. For years it didn't happen again, at least from what I remember... but recently it did occor for another 2 times. I was going to math class, and suddenly I froze in the hallway as the realization hit me, I didn't know where I was going- I knew it was math class... but not the location, I had been to this class for almost 2 months now, 3 days a week. I knew this information but for some strange reason I suddenly didn't have a clue besides it was in this building I stood In. I didn't move, I stood contemplative untill I heard my professors voice from next to me
""Hey, is everything alright?"" She looked confused to see me standing in the center of the intersecting hallways, I turned to her replying ""Where is your classroom?"" 
She looked even more puzzled at my question
""My classroom?"" 
I nodded feeling confused and lost on why I didn't know
She looked concerned as she said ""I'm headed there now, follow me"" 
I followed her down the halls, she looked back at me asking ""Are you alright... are you sure you're okay?"" 
I nodded replying
 ""I think so... sorry I guess it's just... a lot on my mind...."" 
It had been a stressful week, but this had not happened for years to my knowledge, it had been almost 4 at least. The most recent and last time it happened was as I entered an elevator, I got in and the doors closed, not a second passed before they opened again, I was on the same floor as before- I was puzzled as I exited the elevator, why didn't it go up? Had I always been alone? Was there someone else before with me? I stood on the first floor unsure before I was approached by staff questioning me, I told them the elevator didn't appear to be working.
I was utterly confused when he tried it, making it to the floor I ment to go to... had the split second I looked down to my feet been longer? Did it really go up to my floor? I kept telling myself that maybe it was just bad luck and the sensor went off... but the question that I hadn't been alone plagued me, did I space out? I was there and then, a second passed- am I just crazy?!
 These types of things haven't happened Incrediblely often from what I know... I know it's not like I'm Dory from finding Nemo... but if and when it does happen it's incredibly difficult and scary. I'm unsure what to do as anyone I've asked doesn't really pay the matter mind or think anything of it.  However when these things happen it can cause major disfunctions of my day and even panic attacks. If anyone has an idea if this is something everyone experiences or if anyone thinks maybe they have somewhat of a clue why this happens It would be incredibly appreciated! Just a concept would make it easier to know what steps need to be taken for this, or possible options at the least. Thank you to those who take the time to read this!",mentalhealth

I am a morbidly, chronically jealous. This is not in the context of a relationship and I need that to be made clear. It mostly exists in terms of self-actualization/ career.

I'm trying to learn why. Apparently I feel theres something that lacks within. OK. Now what?

I am doing shadow work journaling and there's like a mental block when it comes to jealousy and memories of being jealous. Perhaps there's trauma there. Now what? Seriously, these observations are almost unhelpful.

Should I try hypnotherapy to get to the source of it? Should I meditate? Have these helped for you?

1697350140.0,Help ?????,"Hi everyone,  
  
I am feeling lost and in need of help. I don't know if I am depressed or not. My family, friends, and girlfriend don't believe that I am. I just moved to Canada as an international student five months ago. However, I am from a not-so-rich family and my dad took loans to get me here.  
  
When I first arrived, everything felt like sunshine and rainbows. But as time passed, everything started to feel bland and black and white. It started slightly towards the end of 2021, where I lost interest in all my hobbies, including playing video games and soccer. Even story games feel like a chore now.  
  
Currently, I feel really hopeless. I don't know what I want to do or what I want to become. I have no energy for anything and don't have any hobbies. Sometimes I get bursts of energy, but it dies away too soon. Everyone around me says it's my problem, and I need to get myself fixed. I spend too much money now, eat too much, and have gained 22 kilos in 23 months. I sleep too much at the wrong time and can't sleep at night when I need to do anything. I become too lazy to do anything and procrastinate a lot.  
  
For the last couple of weeks, I have been laughing out of nowhere. And it's not even a happy laugh. I know how messed up I am, and it feels like I'm laughing at myself. I feel like a complete loser who can't achieve anything. I am really lost and don't know what to do anymore.

The event ""ended"" this year and lasted for over 2 years. Ended is in quotes because it's not truly over, it's only lessened. I don't feel like I'm living in it physically as much, but I still am. Mentally, even more.


Talking about it at therapy makes me dissociate and lose track of time until the next appointment. Talking about it hurts so much. I can barely talk or think about it without crying and mentally checking out for days or weeks or months depending on how bad it is.


The event left me:

-Not wanting to wake up

-Depressed

-Insecure with myself as an individual, my relationship with this person, and the world around me

-Shattered all my self-confidence and made me internalize that I truly am ugly, unloved, and unwanted

-Scared to go outside and be seen by anyone

-Unable to listen to music anymore, unless I want to be triggered and dissociate for the rest of the week

-Feeling so hopeless with everything in life as this person knew all of this was happening and let it continue due to their pre-existing relationship (which is now over and why it isn't as bad anymore)

I am angry at the world, depressed as fuck, I refuse to let anyone close, anxiety attacks, and my physical health has declined rapidly. 

For context; my narcissist parent gas lighted me my entire life, played way too many manipulation games on me, put me through ‚Äútests‚Äù such as; they would play music üé∂ and encourage me to dance üíÉ just to turn it off a few minutes later and tell me ‚Äúyou see, you‚Äôre a whore. You wished you lived like a dancing whore. You act like a saint but you‚Äôre a whore‚Äù or she would encourage me to make friends just to pick them apart, insult them and burn it all down in front of my eyes. This was my constant lifestyle. So I had to learn to suppress every emotion & I felt myself die. My spirit is physically dead. Im a walking bag of meat with no emotions. I have no friends, no actual contact to the outside world other than the ‚Äúinternet‚Äù where I just watch movies because it still gives me a sort of imagination that she cannot destroy. She now plays mind games that I am too tired to even play. She‚Äôs been constantly egging me on to get a boyfriend and to make friends and to enjoy life, but I know that the second I do, she‚Äôs going to destroy those relationships right before my eyes as she has done because it makes her feel content to watch me in pain. I refuse to let my mom do this again to me, even if it means I will die alone. I cannot put more people through that. 

I feel mentally ill due to the fact that I hate humanity with a passion. I hate being alive.

I would watch the same things he did, I would play the same games he did, etc. I subconsciously did all of that too get his approval. I consider myself to be talented in weird areas. I.e. I have a lot of different skills. I'm starting to realize that I learned all of those skills so I could show other people and they could get impressed. I started using slang that I would never normally say just so certain people around me would think I'm somehow cool in a way. I started smoking weed so I could have stories that would make me 'popular.' It's silly, but I feel like I'm obsessed with being the main character in a sense. I am obsessed when I am the spotlight, when I get the attention. I don't let any of that show too much because I don't want to be a dick, but they're feelings that I think I should express somewhere.

First of all, I am here if anyone out there is struggling with suicidal thoughts or you just need someone to talk/vent to. Been there. The whole world has felt dark and like all the colors were missing.

I have noticed a major cycle I do. I do not know what is ""wrong"" with me, but I have this cycle of meeting people > having great moments and having fun together > gets a little serious/too close > I panic and leave/ghost > feel relieved for a few months > circle back around to them... then it repeats all over again.

I have fallen deeply in love with someone and still left them and broke their heart when everything was going amazing. I do use marijuana to numb a little and I have a history of substance abuse.

One of the biggest examples is when I was in suicidal depression- they told me I was lying for attention, and to get out of skipping my finals (I skipped because the score wouldn't matter obvs).

Everything's my fault. They assume the worst out of me. I'm tense around them and sometimes hypervigilant bc they only point out the mistakes or bad things I do and I'm waiting for more negativity. And rarely point out the good. It's true I spent most of my life lacking direction and giving up, but as an adult I'm driven and working hard to accomplish things. It doesn't matter- they don't see it.

I feel like such shit about myself all the time.

They can do nice things too, and they have done several caring things for me. But there's been so much negativity in the relationship, it doesn't outweigh this, it has affected me a lot. For years I've carried some of the bigger stuff they've said to me and I think about it near-daily.

I‚Äôve never felt comfortable sharing my feelings with them, cause they either never listen or they make me feel ashamed. 

So, I learned to deal with everything in isolation.

I resorted to SH and that was how I found comfort. I would starve myself to feel some sort of control, and when I lost a lot of weight, my parents even PRAISED me. I felt that my value only extended to what I could ‚Äúaccomplish.‚Äù I also started cutting myself and other forms of self harm. It was the only way I could find comfort in how much pain I felt. Talking to people about my feelings wasn‚Äôt an option. Over the years, I‚Äôve hurt too many people with my mental health, and so many people left me because I was too much for them. I feel disgusting about how I feel, and I feel nothing but shame for my depressive episodes.

Now that I‚Äôm at college, I expected it to be so good for me. That I would find peace now that I was away from my parents, but my depression followed me. For the past two weeks, I haven‚Äôt left my dorm for anything but classes. Occasionally, if I was already out, I‚Äôd pick up food. And I never want to leave my dorm to get food, so I either eat in my dorm or I don‚Äôt eat at all. On good days, I would go down once to get lunch. I just don‚Äôt have an appetite, and when I do, I don‚Äôt have the motivation to get food or make food. So, I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve lost more weight, but I‚Äôve started finding comfort in it. Like I still have some control.

Last night, something in me broke. My two month long streak of being SH free was thrown out the window. I gave up. I felt too overwhelmed with my feelings and all my friends left for the mid-semester break, and now I‚Äôm here all alone for five days. I feel isolated again. Seeing everyone having fun with their friends and family at home made me feel so out of place.

I always feel out of place. Even when my friends are here, they never want to hang out. So, it‚Äôs not really like it‚Äôs any different from the past three weeks. I started thinking again if anyone would even care if I existed.

I never even planned out a life this long. I don‚Äôt know where it‚Äôs heading. It‚Äôs too overwhelming. I don‚Äôt want to feel this way anymore, and I‚Äôm so tired of pretending like everything‚Äôs okay. 

I just want to give up on it all.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.",mentalhealth
1697318360.0,feeling anxious for seemingly no reason??? need help,"hi everyone first reddit post here but I really need advice and i've reached breaking point. I (24F) have really been struggling with managing my anxiety and depression since about August of this year - so about 2/3 months. I've struggled throughout my entire life but I got into my first serious relationship over a year ago with my boyfriend (24M), he's lovely, on paper everything is absolutely perfect, he treats me well, he's extremely supportive, he makes me laugh, he treats me like a princess, he's essentially every woman's dream man, he's made a lot of mistakes surrounding his exes that I won't go into too deeply (he's never cheated or anything, just things such as hanging on to gifts that have in turn hurt my feelings and going into depth about his sexual history) but he's apologised time and time again and he's working hard to regain my trust. Over the last couple of months I almost feel like I've lost feelings for him and I've been left so confused because he's everything I want and sometimes I feel like he's the love of my life and I'll be looking at engagement rings and picturing a future with him and the next minute I just feel nothing but crippling, stomach churning anxiety. I've been through a lot over the last year - with relationship stress, I lost my dog and my parrot (both of which I've had since I was a kid) within a month of each other, my relationship with my emotionally abusive dad broke down and I haven't spoken to him in under a year while still living in the same house, I've begun SH again after being clean for 10 years and attempted unaliving and I left my job due to quickly building stress and I'm on a 6 month long waiting list for a therapist so I'm on my own - so I'm unsure if this is something that's played a part? I feel so lost, part of me wants to leave him to see if the pain will stop and part of me doesn't want to lose him. I feel like I've got nothing left because he was one good thing I had and now it feels like its crumbling around me. We are on vacation right now and I've spent most of it sobbing. I feel like I've constantly got a weight on my chest. Has anyone experienced this before?? Any tips and advice? I feel like I'm losing my mind.",mentalhealth

1697339610.0,ADHD? OCD? What can it be?,"There is a chance that I may have ADHD. I hate self-diagnosing but honestly this is me just surrendering because it hurts my ego I'm 22M and it's hard for me to explain some of these symptom's because these are my norms so I find it hard to distinguish what MIGHT be considered ADHD vs what's normal. I've already made an appointment to go speak to a psychiatrist about my potential OCD (99% sure I also have that) and will bringing this up as well. Some of the symptoms that make me think that I may have ADHD are 1st, I tend to procrastinate a lot for example, I go to sleep telling myself ""I have to study tomorrow"" then the next day as I'm typing this I haven't studied at all and it's about to be 10:00pm, I can't stay still while seated I have to physically move my legs or hands just to release something and feel good. Always chasing dopamine, eating sweets and even wearing headphones 24/7 just to stimulate myself (except at work and that's because they don't allow headphones). When it comes to school lectures I always get distracted within 5min and start daydreaming (I daydream a lot) I went to math tutoring and while the teacher was tutoring me I caught myself pretending like I'm listening and while I understood everything he taught me I did ask him to repeat himself many times because of my lack of focus. This was also a problems in high school which lead me to have super bad grades and eventually drop out. It's just weird, I've started and finished chapter books before, I have a good reputation at work. My only problem at is work is that I catch myself going back and forth to places gathering stuff that I need in order to finish my work a lot instead of getting everything I need in one go. Honestly, life has been so exhausting. I preform pretty good at work but when I get home I have a very hard time starting what I need to. I'm starting to hate myself because I keep lying to myself over and over about the things that I need to complete. Another major symptom I have is that I tend to change ""Phases"" every few weeks/months. For example, I wasted so much money trying to learn guitar, I went and bought a pretty expensive acoustic guitar, bought lessons online and practiced so much just to drop it the next month and that's pretty much what I've been doing for a while. Picking subjects up and dropping them after I've spend so much money. Anyways, I know no one here can physically help me but I had to rant.",mentalhealth

1697335026.0,I don't know what's happening,"This is most likely more appropriate for r/askpsychology but I'm pretty sure it violates some of the rules. 

I went down a rabbit hole of reading about psychology, and I realised that I possess quite a few dark triad traits (I know it's the dark tetrad now, but sadism doesn't really apply to me so I'm ignoring it). Like I was reading about it, and realised that I display some of these traits pretty frequently. I will say it's mainly machiavellism, but there's definitely a bit of psychopathy and narcissism in there too.

I don't really know what to think, as in general I'm a nice person, but when I think about it, I do manipulate people a lot (not necessary maliciously), and i'm pretty apathetic to tragedy. It seems to me like in the past year or so these traits have developed, and they are slowly worsening.

This summer, I had a job that involved a lot of sitting around doing nothing, as I was supervising, but there wasn't much to do. To occupy the time, I spent probably like 5-6 hours a day all summer creating a plan to completely take over the world. I know this seems crazy but it was incredibly in depth, with every step outlined. I'm not gonna get into too much detail, but it would take about 2.5 years to implement, and whoever executed it would have complete control and influence over everyone. Every government, all the ressources, everything. At the end of the summer I thought to myself ""this is crazy"" and threw it out.

I read that people that display these personality types have a higher chance of becoming criminals, and I'm not necessarily worried about that, but I don't want the traits to become more pronounced.

1697333438.0,Feeling stuck when I should be having the time of my life,"(TLDR down below) 

Hi. I'm 25 (F) with depression/anxiety/ADD/bipolar and two years ago I moved out of the country to pursue a masters degree in a field I've always dreamt of pursuing. The course didn't go to plan and I basically flopped my final project. Passed, but not with something I'm proud of. During that time I also got into a relationship with a man who's from the city I moved to and he turned out to be very abusive and ended up physically hurting me at the end of it. 

I had a rough handful of months after that ended and couldn't even stay awake for most of the days that I wasn't doing drugs. Couldn't find a job or even maintain a strong connection with my own reality. Things started to turn around and I found a job in the service industry (something I always have done) and also found a great group of friends. I still couldn't help but feel like I was experiencing life outside of my body and my control. I have had awful experiences in dating since I got out of my abusive relationship and experienced some severe heartbreak at the hands of \*genuinely\*  narcissistic men (I don't throw that word around lightly). 

I ended up having to come home for a month because I reached a breaking point and decided to see a  new psychiatrist who prescribed me some new meds and new diagnoses (ADD & Bipolar). It's now the end of that month and I'm going back but I can't help but feel like I'm not supposed to live there anymore. Both of my parents have mentioned they would like to see me move back sometime soon and it makes me feel guilty for living so far away. I was packing today and my mom just stood at the door and watched me while she teared up.

I feel like moving back would be a setback. It would be an immense failure for me - and I would miss my friends. I don't really relate to my friends from home anymore and feel like I would slow my personal and career growth process if I did come back. Where I'm from doesn't have many opportunities for what I want to do. I think it would really send me into a deep depression but on the other hand,  I feel like I need to tackle my mental health because I've always tried and shove it under the rug to avoid having to move back home. When I was in highschool I was admitted for telling my therapist that I was going to unsubscribe from life after I left our session. I quickly backpeddled when I talked to the doctors and social workers at the hospital when I realised I would likely be sent to inpatient care. I wish I didn't because high school was probably a way easier time to start life over again after inpatient care while I still lived under my parents dime and roof. 

Mental healthcare is not really an option where I live and I would like to be near my family and the comforts of home if I were to admit myself.  


 A lot of people have told me how cool they think my life is and I feel like everyone would be dissapointed if I were to just give it all up because where I'm from, not a lot of people leave the country, let alone the state. I just want to know if any other people on here have experienced this kind of struggle of having to take a step back in a period of their lives when they should be experiencing live to the fullest. I'm in my mid-twenties, living abroad and have really cool and genuine friends that I love and love me. I want to keep living abroad - but I also miss my family, my dogs, and the comforts of home. I feel like time is slipping away and I'm missing a lot of big life events. I feel stuck. I have half a mind to miss my return flight. My visa isn't up until January of 2025 and up until I came home I always thought I would live abroad for at least another 5-10 years. 

**TL;DR:** I don't want to set myself back by moving back home and dealing with my mental health for real this time. I just need some words of encouragement to move forward or some insight from people who made the decision to move back home (whether it was from abroad or not) and how that panned out for you. ü§ç",mentalhealth

Recently some very upsetting news was given to my partner and I and it has been checking the boxes of all my triggers. There is a possibility he may have to move back to the city we used to live in.

A. He struggles heavily with alcoholism as well as Bpd and all of our contacts and friends from said city are in the bar industry 
B. My own Bpd is causing my abandonment to flair up 
C. Early in our relationship he never cheated but was very secretive about his whereabouts as well as caused me a lot of trauma because of the way he acted while intoxicated 
D. Our financial situation is just now about to be back to normal but because of this news it would possibly put us back into debt/ almost homelessness 
E.

1697331147.0,Prescribed depression medication without being told it was for depression,"This is a bit of a long post, to me anyways, and I don‚Äôt really know where to start. I did really well academically in high school and it was entirely self-driven. My mom never checked my grades, I decided if I went to school on any given day, there was no punishment for poor performance, or reward for good performance. I just had this almost magical ability to sit down and study for hours and then retain that information.

Since coming to college, I have lost that ability. I really struggle to pay attention in class, do homework, and study. It feels like I‚Äôm forcing myself to just stare at a page.

I went to a psychiatrist, got diagnosed with ADHD, and walked out with a Bupropion prescription. She said it was basically Adderall. I asked what the side effects were and she told me it caused headaches when stopping or starting the medication, but that was it.

I took it for a few weeks and it did nothing. She increased the dose and I still wasn‚Äôt any different, but had started losing weight (which is very bad in my case as I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 120lbs).

A friend of mine was also recently diagnosed with ADHD and we compared prescriptions. She was surprised that I was on Bupropion because her brother takes it for depression. Apparently, while it can be used for ADHD, it is primarily for treating depression and weaning people off of cigarettes. It can cause a whole host of things including weight loss and depression, ironically.

Online it says not to give it out to people with eating disorders, and I told her that I had what basically was an eating disorder. Long story short, I stopped being hungry December of last year. I ran a very stupid experiment to see how long I could go before feeling hungry, but decided to stop at four days. Since then I‚Äôve struggled to remember to eat because it‚Äôs hard to force yourself to eat when you‚Äôre not hungry.

You could argue that I don‚Äôt have what is psychologically considered an eating disorder and that‚Äôs why she felt comfortable prescribing it, and I‚Äôll accept that, but she could have warned me. It feels like I was given this medication under false pretenses, and we never talked in-depth about depression. She asked if I had felt depressed and what my social life was like and that was it.

I‚Äôm not going to take the pills anymore and I‚Äôve been looking into other doctors at different clinics because I feel like I just can‚Äôt trust her after this. Sadly, there‚Äôs a four month waiting list everywhere else so I‚Äôm just going to have to power through this semester and make up for it later.

But I tend to notice other symptoms and link them to other disorders while I‚Äôm having a depressive episode. The first time, it was with ADHD. Some of my depressive symptoms overlapped with symptoms of ADHD and my brain made a connection. The second time, it was with ASD. I had a physical illness at the time and it caused me to have issues with social interaction and sensory processing. I linked those symptoms to ASD. I did see a professional for this, but I think he died cause he never got back to me. Whenever this happens, my brain finds instances of me expressing those symptoms in childhood so it‚Äôs not just a now thing.

Now, my brain is convinced I have bipolar II. I recently experienced something that meets the criteria of a hypo manic episode. My brain is now linking all my experiences to that. 

It‚Äôs really annoying. I feel embarrassed to go to a professional about these issues because my stupid brain keeps linking whatever the hell I have to mental disorders I probably don‚Äôt have. I think it is important to mention that this isn‚Äôt factitious disorder. I‚Äôm not trying to deceive people, nor do I present myself as ill, my brain just keeps making connections. It‚Äôs really annoying and embarrassing. I want it to stop.",mentalhealth

So basically long story shortni relapsed after 6 months. When I started forever ago I was at my lowest point in life, eventually I got out of it, but now I'm back in it, and I've relapsed. I want to tell my friends because last time I did it, they helped me. But I have new friends, and yes I've hinted things like it towards them like asking random questions ""have u ever thought Abt sh"" and things like that.

But I don't want to throw it on them. I don't know how they'll react, when I try to tell adults I get mute, and I know I can overcome it eventually on my own, but I hate it, I really fucking hate it, and idk, just two questions

1697330086.0,is therapy making me worse or are things finally catching up to me? is suppression my best option? explanation continued in comment,"Page 1/2

I‚Äôll try to summarize but there‚Äôs a lot to unload. I‚Äôm a 29 year old woman and have what I‚Äôd call a hard life though I haven‚Äôt thought so until recently. I‚Äôve had multiple near death encounters though I won‚Äôt get into that, grew up with parents who were unfit, and likely have a lot of childhood trauma. The thing is that up until now I have always felt genuinely unaffected by it all and able to rise above until my grandfather passed away who was like a father to me and my true hero. I have always saw so much of myself in him. He made me love what he loves, and instilled me to create a career as a botanist. I will never love another human like him.

A year ago he had a heart attack, and I left my home thousands of miles away to go be with family. I always considered my grandparents to be more of my parents than my real ones and thought that they were the only reason I believed in platonic and romantic love. After a month of a traumatic stay in the hospital, he died. I don‚Äôt remember feeling any sort of way because I was only focused on being there for my family, especially my grandmother who was with his for over 60 years since she was 15 years old. I have a history of dissociating so I would guess that is what I was dealing with.

Upon his passing, I found out she had grown to hate him the past three years while I was away. She found out about previous infidelities, and she lost all trust and respect for him. She was deeply hurt, and I guess he never gave her closure in telling her why he did it and grew to resent her for how she began to treat him. My family members are very selfish and narcissistic people, so they were expecting my grandmother to ‚Äújust get over‚Äù my grandfathers passing within the first month and either cut off ties to her or would scream at her for being sad. 

That left me being the only one who would listen to her. I know she needed it, and we have a deep bond and understanding of each other, but in listening I found out so many details I might have been better off not knowing. I found out that their relationship was toxic not limited to infidelity and physical abuse. There was a point that he encouraged her to kill herself then made fun of her for ‚Äúnot even being able to do that right.‚Äù She begged him to compliment her, but all he could say was that she was a good mother and kept his house clean. She thinks he has children with other women, though I don‚Äôt know what to believe. In light of this information, I don‚Äôt know if I believe in love at all since my only example turned out to be a facade.

Months after his passing, she found out that their joint bank account of over $150K had been nearly entirely drained by him. She has lost his social security and now lives alone in their house. In her grieving, she damned him every chance she could get, and declared she hated him and had no reason to live. She also lost her filter and told me about how my parents raised me and my siblings. I have vague memories of my father sexually assaulting me and she confirmed them. My father still wants me to sleep in his bed when I‚Äôm at his home, calls me hot, walks in on my showering, and I caught him peeping and staring at me while I was getting dressed. My grandmother also told me that my mother would poison my brother and I to get attention from hospitals, which would explain circumstances of my mother giving me ‚Äúspecial medicine,‚Äù finding poison in her bathroom cabinets, and having extreme illness as a kid. Apparently these events were confirmed by doctors, and after CPS was skeptical the visit to the hospital stopped. I would still become ill. My mother would insist that I go to the hospital while my father strongly opposed. So I mostly stayed at home alone with them fighting about it.

I wasn‚Äôt allowed by my parents to have negative emotions. If I did, they‚Äôd tell me that they would take me to the ‚Äúkid pound‚Äù to be adopted by another family or euthanized. Any time I felt sick, my dad told me I was wanting attention, so I learned to not express my illness and ultimately not feel it. I still deal with these consequences today and mostly have muted negative emotions and extreme tolerance to pain with refusal to go to a doctor unless I think I might die or am forced to (i.e. being but by a venomous snake or being hit by a truck). Even then I go reluctantly. If my siblings and I argued, my dad would hand us knives and tell us to kill each other. Years ago, my mother admitted they purposefully underfed me because they didn‚Äôt want me turning into a fat girl. I was 37 pounds in 5th grade and am unable to gain weight or feel hunger to this day. 

When I was 16 I tried to kill myself and was forced to go to a psychiatric ward. It cost a lot of money, and my mom had a habit of racking up tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt, so I guess my stay made it financially difficult for them. My dad was ashamed to have a daughter like me because he is about public image and I was an embarrassment for being in a ward, so I never told anyone why I missed school and didn‚Äôt get visits from them in the hospital. I remember my nurse telling me I was a pretty girl and wondering if I realized I didn‚Äôt belong there because I didn‚Äôt open up about anything to my doctors to save my family‚Äôs face, so she assumed I was a normal girl with a normal childhood. That validated my fathers invalidation. After my stay, my parents‚Äô relationship worsened. My dad started working at a pizzeria where I worked saying it was to make extra money for my stay.

1697343550.0,My bf will be raped tomorrow,"
First of all, sorry for my Broken english, its not my first language.
I dont know if this ks the right place to post this but i need help with this.

So, i 15m, have a long distance bf, 16m, we have been together for 4 months now, he is the sweetest boy i have ever met, but, he might kill himself after tomorrow.

So, to start this, his parents, were already very old when they had him. They had a son because of social pressure, and made sure to remind this to him every single day of his life, he had a rather normal chilhood until he was about 8 years old.

At that age, his cousin, who was 21 at that time, started raping him all summer. He put his head into a tub while he raped him as he cut his back with a broken bottle,  telling him how despicable he was and how much everyone hates him.

In school, he had almost no friends, once, his group of friends, made him get into an abandoned building and let him in during the entire day, he got bullied all his life, his mother didnt care for him, because even the teachers bullied him, and they told everyone, he was faking getting bullied for attention. It got to a point where even a teacher tried to throw him down the stairs.

One day, when he was 10, at the exit of school, 2 men started touching him, and he couldnt do anything to stop them, at 11, the school janitor, locked him and tried to rape him, but failed, because some kid entered.

As he grew, his bulling grew too and the agressivity of his cousin too.

At 13, he after 3 scde attemtps, finally managed to make his cousin stop. At that time, life became a bit better for him, he got friends, but then in 2021 everything went upside down

Firstly, his group of new friends, turned on him. They hit him, to the point where he almost bled out,  this happened almost everyday, his mother, didnt care for him and just negleted him. His entire town bullied and hurt him all the time, in this time, he tried to end himself 5 more times.

He got some virtual friends who he could talk to, and distract himself with, but, they both died.
One ended himself and the other one...

She was going to see her virtual friend irl, my bf warned her not to, but she didnt care.
She told him that his scars were disgusting and that he deserved all that his cousin did to him.
That same day, her friend stabbed her because of a disagreement.

Then, the bulling, started to be less extreme.
He still got and gets kicked or punched every time school ends, but they dont try to kill him or try to dismember him anymore.

In 2022-2023 he started going to see a therapist, and he got better, but because of that, he got 9 classes suspended.

Now in 2023, he is in advanced class, he hasnt slept for 2 weeks neither has he eaten nearly anything so he is weak. 
The problem is, there is a teacher, who eventually, got closer and closer to raping him.
First, he massaged his shoulders while explaining to him, then, he started rubbing his nipple, and last week, he touched his genitals. This wensday, the teacher, took his hand when the bell rang and made him stay after class. When there wasnt nobody left, he grabbed his hair and both of his hands, and threw him to the floor.
He tried to scream, but the teacher put his fingers in his mouth. He tried to bite him, escape, everything. 
But he was too weak to escape.
The teacher put his pants down and got closer, but suddenly, he heard people coming and let him go

On mondays, he usually has spanish before break, but because of some issues, he will have class with the teacher that tried to rape him just before break.

We are afraid, that the teacher might make him stay in during break and rape him.

We cant contact police, he already did, but they didnt believe him, they said he needed proof, and also, the officer sons, bullied him, so that isnt an option.

The principal hates him and also neglets him.

His parents dont believe or care about him.

So, what can he do to stop being raped and touched?

He cant miss class because he wants to get an honor degree so he can move out.

What can he do? 

He said if he gets raped again, he will not be able to deal with the trauma, so what can i do?

1697316142.0,I've been feeling depressed and disgusted this past week ... how can I get my shit together ASAP?,"I need to get my shit together ASAP because I'm in law school and need to focus.

This past week, it was our fall break. I didn't really get much done. I stayed home, cooked, spent a day with the family, and that's about it. 

The international events made me feel terrible. I was watching all the videos that would come up on my feed. I noticed it was affecting me and I deleted my social media apps off my phone this morning. 

On top of that, I lost 2 of my friends over these events. I posted a story acknowledging the horrible things happening in Gaza. While denouncing Hamas, of course. But two of my friends replied, accusing me of being a Hamas supporter while they both straight up said they do not care about the events because they hate Muslims (they actually admitted this ...). 

Anyway. I'm just feeling like shit now. I feel like I should've gotten more work done over break. I can't seem to focus when I do sit down to study. I feel guilty. I feel lazy. I feel upset. 

What's your guys' advice to getting back on track ASAP? I'm going to look for a therapist but that's going to take at least a couple weeks. Just short term so I can get back into the grind before I fall behind in school.

Thank you. ",mentalhealth

1697314404.0,What can I do I feel so lost,"I'm 17 turning 18 in a few months and for the last 4 years I've been dealing with a lot of mental issues that have been ruining my life. For my whole life I've been dealing with symptoms of OCD, my first memories and experiences were OCD. My dad was and still is an abusive alcoholic which I can't really remember anything of even though I should since my mother and brother tell me he used to do all kinds of traumatic things like hitting us with objects and screaming and hitting my mother I really only remember the good things of early childhood which people told me is a defense mechanism of my brain to protect me. Which I think is also one of my reasons my OCD came into my life. OCD really started effecting my life when I turned 13-14 ever since I had intrusive thoughts about a certain topic in my mind and head that never left me and stayed in my mind for the whole day and sometimes even in my sleep it's something I think about when I go to bed and when I wake up. The thing is I'm turning 18 soon and everyone around me at school and work is growing into adulthood and worrying about certain responsibilities etc. And yet here I am still getting thoughts about something that isn't even important. It feels like everyone around me has grown up but I haven't, I haven't really 'grown up' , for 4 years my mind didn't even have time to process growing up my mind was stuck figuring something out there is no awnser to.

1697314113.0,How can I stop being so angry all the time and lashing out at my family?,"Hi everyone. Posting on here because I‚Äôve had a rough past two weeks and I feel like my mental health has really deteriorated with no promise of getting better and I feel really down.

For some context, I‚Äôm a 22 year old living with my Mom and my Stepdad. They have a history of being verbally abusive with me and when I was about 15/15, slightly physically abusive. I‚Äôve had to deal with this for many years, and it‚Äôs affected me a great deal. My Mom shouts and swears at me a lot, blames me for a lot of things and in general can be quite nasty. An example of this was two weeks ago when I was coming down with COVID, and I had told her I‚Äôd wash my dishes in the morning as my head was hurting a lot and I felt so ill. She proceeded to bang around the house, call me a ‚Äòfucking prick‚Äô and things like ‚Äòlazy‚Äô ‚Äòuseless‚Äô etc. It was really scary to be honest and the first major episode from her in a while.

Fast forward to today and I just have a lot of repressed anger about this and previous incidents. She refused to apologise for swearing at me and told my family members that I was the one who brought it onto myself. This always happens and I just feel like I am sick of this cycle, but I have no way of getting out.

I absolutely want to try and get out of it, but there‚Äôs times where she does try to apologise in her own way (kind of bury it under the rug and act nice before it happens again). I‚Äôm used to it but recently I‚Äôve become really conscious about my own anger. I just get so frustrated and cut her off even if she does try with me lately and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm just going to mess things up even more. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is I don‚Äôt know how to deal with my anger towards my family and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm turning into a really unpleasant and horrible person. I really do want to try with her, but I just feel so damn angry all of the time

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can cope with this and avoid lashing out?

1697312365.0,Being prescribed medication before receiving a proper diagnosis?,"Before 2013; I didn't know how long it would take to diagnose someone with a mental disorder worth prescribing psychotropic medication over. I didn't know that most sessions with psychiatrists would be something like 5 to 20 minutes long on average and that they will prescribe medication to you after only one session.

I was first prescribed Klonopin and Lexapro by a psychiatrist to treat anxiety and depression back in 2013. It was only after one session and it lasted just a few minutes. Since 2013; I've met with four different psychiatrists from various different practices and they all behave pretty much the same way. Within my first sessions with them; I'd get them sighing at me, rolling their eyes at me, yawning at me, rushing me along, etc. With the last two psychiatrists I had; they simply asked me what my previous psychiatrists were prescribing to me and just continued to prescribe to me more of the same.

I first went to see a psychologist with a PhD. in order to have myself evaluated for any and all mental disorders, personality disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, etc. back in 2016. He diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. This diagnosis appears in my psychological evaluation report that he gave me. Before that point--such a diagnosis did not appear in any of my medical records with the other mental health care providers I had already seen.

I was first prescribed an antipsychotic (Abilify) in 2017 and was taking it throughout late-2017, all of 2018, and early-2019. It was supposedly meant to treat anxiety and depression. My most recent psychiatrist decided to stop prescribing it to me.

I developed hallucinations for the first time in October of 2019. I was involuntarily committed to a hospital in August of 2022.

I know I could just go out and do it and I don't want to continue with a ""but"" now, so I won't. I will just say that the Realisation of me having a certain potential and feeling very good and self confident about it, is coming in very rare phases and is not always there. I just went outside walking and listened to music and felt so confident and I know this sounds unhealthy socially, but I think it's also because it's the feeling of agression I get, when I feel that I have been told a lot as a kid, that I can't do certain things or that I'm not able or my parent even implied that I was ill psychologically, which is of course a very bad and also completely wrong message to send. And sometimes when I feel like all of that is in the background of my mind and I, at the same time have evidence that they are wrong and it's true that someone is or was mistreading me and i don't give a shit about them in that way anymore, I feel so energized.

Didn't sleep for days and hallucinated seeing devils after taking Zopiclone.

Since then pain in the central part of the forehead. Paracetamol and other painkillers don't work. Have to keep clenching jaw, opening and closing it to try and break down the pressure in the central part of the forehead (pain is nowhere else). 

Behaviours are... thought there was a deeper meaning to numbers on license plates. Thought they could heal people at one point. Constant thoughts of being a bad person, and making mistakes. Thinks they are going to prison. Paranoid that people are against them.

Back and forth between mental health teams, A&E due to being crippled by anxiety, feeling depressed and just want to lay in bed watching TV to distract their brain. Pain is 24/7 in their forehead while awake and constantly picking at it with their fingers and gyrating their jaw.

Wtf is this shit?  Can't see any similar stories of the pain in the forehead. Trying to help my brother find the cause. MRI scan showing nothing, medication hasn't helped so far ( currently on Mirtazapine 45g and Venlaflaxin 75g both at night, recently given Sodium Valporate 250g two times a day which has seen a recent decline in mental well-being) should we be asking for PET scan to see wtf is going on with his forehead/brain?

1697324698.0,Man boobs ruining my life,"So I've been a chubby kid ever since I can remember and have had a big/loose chest. That's just how my body stores fat. I remember in kindergarten, a boy mockingly asked me why I had such a big chest during swimming lessons and pinched them. It was the first time I felt that my chest was something abnormal. Somehow, this lsmall interaction stuck with me, and I never went for swimming lessons again and still can't swim at all. I know it's kind of silly, but Im surprised too at how much a kid of that age can get embarrassed about their body.

Nevertheless, this stuck with me. As I grew older, my chest grew bigger, and I became less confident, especially when puberty hit. I got bad at things I used to be good at, like debate and football because I was so self-conscious about my body that I couldn't concentrate at all. Eventually, I stopped doing all my favorite activities like debate and football, and my school life and grades were severely affected.

Now, fast forward to today, I'm in college, and my man boobs are still literally affecting my future. I have zero confidence because it feels like everyone is judging my big moobs. Even though most of it might be in my head, things are getting worse and worse. My friends make fun of my moobs (not bullying). I slouch forward to make my moobs less prominent, but this has destroyed my posture and caused back pain. I don't go to college and club events, parties and I haven't even explored my school campus in the 3 years I've been here because I'm too self conscious.

I tried to get over this by going to the gym. But I'm too afraid of wearing a tee because my moobs are so prominent in them. I can't wear a hoodie because I live in a warm climate. I can't go to the dining halls because I feel so self-conscious, and I end up ordering food for 2-3 meals a day (my school conveniently has excellent food delivery services). All the bridges that could help me get better seem to be burning because of my self-consciousness.

And need I mention, I can't talk to girls. It's not that I'm afraid of them or something, but I feel too self-conscious in front of them. I don't know why I have this image of a perfect me and can't seem to do anything because I'm not it. I've met so many good girls, but I chicken out before anything starts.

I've yet to see a doctor about my moobs, but I'm pretty sure it's all fat, given I had them pre-puberty as well. I'm soon graduating from college, and I know that if I continue to miss opportunities because I don't feel confident enough, I will lose big time in life. Has anyone here gone through this? Can you guys give any advice?

I(24 F) have always thought that if I don‚Äôt like something I can change it. It‚Äôs what always kept me going. I can change my appearance, and who I am. I can change the people I surround myself with, and the place I work. But I always end up in the same place. Unhappy. It‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault that I feel this way.

I want to figure out some more handable coping mechanism for some stuff that bothers me since a few years. Yes I know... Talking and Therapie all helps but I'm not asking for this kind of advice. In my circumstance I just try to get through it till I can allow myself to really cope with that whole shit. Right now my coping mechanism is keeping myself busy to a level were I am ill every 3-4weeks because my body can't handle the stress I'm exposing it to. I always crave for days without any obligations but when I got nothing to do I start to spiral down and getting small panic attacks - I can deal with them but obviously it's bothering me and they are putting me back every time.

So I basically ask for better ways to not cope with stuff... I know it's not healthy but I'm sure a few of u can understand what I mean. Maybe we can just exchange some tips and tricks to get trough - would be rly nice <3

Thankks 




PS. I Don't have a drastic kinda traumatising horror story like Trauma - I'm just a person that suppress emotional feelings and it helps me to keep going and to support the people around me when every thing else breaks down.

Right now I am having a terrible mental breakdown, you see,  I am not a wealthy person, I can hardly move outside of my city without hurting me a lot. You all won't believe the happiness  I've got when I heard that a solar eclipse was about to hover above my city, in it's most beautiful glory.

 then I went to buy protection but didn't find any, the entire city got them. I knew the risks of looking at it, so I avoided my very best to look at it, I only proceeded to see it, when an amazing couple I've met in the park gave me a filter. Everything was wonderful until I got home, and at the moment I am writing this post.

So, here comes what is killing me.

I admit, that although I knew the risks, before I had found any protection I couldn't resist trying to take a few quick glances at it, but everytime I did that, the sun was still there and my behavior was to immediately turn my head away from it. This happened a couple times, with me always looking away in less than a heartbeat.  
A friend of mine told me this wonderful sentence:

So talking to her about things just has the negative effect because I've always had problems about felt guilty for having a good life.

I tell her that I dont really feel good about my body but she just always brings up the fact that she has body dismorphia when I dont.

1697322649.0,Possible Traumatic Event?,"I (20F) think I may have a form of possible PTSD or cPTSD from something I experienced in my childhood/early adolescence. 

From when I was about 11 years old to 16 years old, I was involved in the world of professional ballet. (This isn't the typical dance-class-after-school type of ballet- I mean the intense, 'Black Swan'-esque, psychological nightmare, training 40+ hours weekly, Russian coaches screaming at you and hitting you with a yardstick type- think the Red Room from the Black Widow movie). I was involved in this highly strict and professionalized world for about 5 years and it completely wrecked my life for that entire period of time. I didn't have a social life or friends because all of my spare time was spent in training- usually from about 3pm after school to 10-11pm at night. It was constant belittlement- you were insulted by coaches and your self-esteem was broken apart until the coaches were your only sense of validation. Injuries were rampant. The worst aspect was not feeling in control of my own life. I didn't control my life- the coaches did. I had no autonomy or decisionmaking power of my own and I felt trapped for years. 

Anyway, I quit when I was sixteen and was finally able to muster up the strength to just admit that I couldn't do it anymore. I was severely depressed and didn't see a future to my life since my life felt like something that wasn't mine. Soon after quitting I developed what seemed to be some sort of panic disorder- I would have these random, seemingly unprovoked awful anxiety attacks where I would just start throwing up and crying. I'd be getting sick to my stomach for hours, the room would be spinning, I'd be shaking and I'd lose all ability to have coherent thoughts. I'd almost feel trapped in my own body. The attacks were unprovoked- they weren't typical anxiety where they would happen when I was nervous or before important events, but literally were random. Since then I've gotten a handle on it- I'm in university now, I'm a straight-A prelaw student and I graduated with high honors and a 4.0 from high school. I still have the anxiety problem, though the physical symptoms are much rarer and more controllable now. I saw a therapist years ago and was diagnosed with severe general anxiety disorder- but i NEVER had any pattern of mental health issues before the years of ballet training. I never had even been the type to get anxious, and i'd never had a panic attack in my life. I occasionally have these episodes where I have this paralyzing fear of losing control over my own life and I feel like someone else is going to seize power over my life again. It's just this basic fear of losing decisionmaking power. I dissociate sometimes when the anxiety gets that bad. I also have very little memory of the 5 years of my life I lost to training. I don't remember any specific incidents from that time period; it's all a blur between ages 11 and 16. I have a very good memory otherwise for other parts of my life, so I'm not sure if that's some sort of way of my mind blocking it out. I have developed pretty bad rage issues also since that time (which I never had before)- I'll get abnormally enraged over these tiny little incidents like someone chewing too loudly or a bus driving too slow on my way to class. Once again, I had absolutely ZERO mental health issues prior to those years. I really don't want to self-diagnose here but I feel like some sort of trauma could be a possibility. I'd like to know so I can go about getting help for it. While the physical symptoms are almost nonexistent at this point, the mental symptoms are still there, and I still live with this odd constant fear of losing control over my life. Any thoughts?

so i have been struggling with OCD and anxiety disorders for years. For the most part, it all ends up revolving around the fact that I have an incredible fear of death. I can't cope with these fears anymore, they've been dominating life and for months and its reached a point where it sucked out all the enjoyment out of me. I feel bad most of the time, I'm irritable, I don't sleep well and a lot of the time i just randomly start crying because I can't take it anymore. According to all these tests, I'm suffering a major depressive episode, mostly because I've been thinking of suicide. I'm not actually considering it though, I'd never do. They always say thinking about it is already a bad sign but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to commit. It's ironic, of course, because I'm so incredibly afraid of death. I would never kill myself, but everything is just too much and I just want my peace, which is why i might have had the odd thought about it.

  
The funny thing is, even if I could get my OCD under control, I think I still wouldn't have any meaning in life. It always sounds so pretentious, especially because I used to make fun of people like that. Now I just can't see the point in living. Sooner or later you die anyway. I can't enjoy the moment at all if every day could be my last. I have never lived life to its fullest and I will most certainly regret a lot of things when its finally time. The thought of death becomes even worse in case I'd get mentally stable because then I'd have all the fun and enjoyment back and I'd never get enough of it. does that make sense?

""The Coddling of the American Mind"" proposes antifragility as a cure for safetyism, emphasizing that exposure to challenges and risks, rather than protection from them, strengthens individuals' resilience and mental toughness.

  
I'm new to Reddit and have noticed that a lot of words are censored. Understandably, they are hard to hear. Words such as ""abortion,"" ""suicide,"" or ""sex"" tend to be censored in some fashion, such as ""aortion,"" ""s\*\*cide,"" or ""sx.""

  
My question to Reddit is, is it a social miscalculation if I don't censor these words? Will these words truly cause someone physiological duress? If you yourself have this experience, I'm curious about how you feel when seeing these words in their direct form rather than the censored form.

1697300812.0,"I wanted to help my sister, going through depression","Hey, hello. I needed help in understanding my sister's situation right now. I'll give a brief context, hoping that helps.

I (27M) and my sister(24F) are very close. But I have to move to a different city for work. Recently my sister started having episodes of anxiety, body pain and panic attacks. And she consulted a therapist and the therapist said she is clinically depressed. So the TLDR is I wanted to help her, but not sure how to. I am going to state things that happened and things I did and needed community's help in giving me directions.

We are from India, if that matters. So quick brief context is,
- Our childhood was not great. Mom and dad had a lot of fights and disagreements, such that they were stayed separated for 4 years and now they are back. But dad was bit of an alcoholic at that point in time, causing whole lot of wreck in the family's peace. So bit of troubled childhood.
- 2 years back, I moved out of my family for work. So she and I spent a bit of less time over the time. And she too started going for work.
- This year one of her close friend went to UK and that is what I feel like the start of the intense sadness and etc.
- Also, in the mean time, she was hung up on buying a lot of expensive things, because her close friends could, but because of our financial situations my parents advised her not to, that led up to a lot of quarrel. From what I have seen, she is feeling bit of financially crippled because her close friends are bit well off. Not sure if this factored into what she is going through, but I feel like this contributed to a lot of quarrel in the house.
- And her workplace is a place of medical field, where is used to work with healthcare people, and the process. She did Masters in Social work and working with hospitals. So she knows more about mental health than I am. She reads about those things and work with these patients as well. Plus her day to day work, she had to see few patients suffer and sometimes worse. I am also afraid whether this could have contributed to her disturbance. 
- But this change in her life, with financially well off friends, the recent work place, quarrel at home, feeling less achieved (she talks like that often), is the new things that happened in the recent times.

Now coming to the things we did,
- My parents are bit old fashioned, but I have gave them a whole talk to not force her to do anything, considering her mental health is not great. And they are so helping right now. She starves intentionally sometimes, and my mom tries to feed her, atleast some juice etc.
- Her boyfriend is also very supportive, taking her to beach, or some cafe etc. 
- My sister (another sister) and I are also helpful. I moved back with her to keep an eye on her because she did self harm (cutti*g her wrists) multiple times. 
- I tried getting her some books, drawing books, things that she can do if she is so physically exhausted etc. But nothing works.
- I have planned to take her with me to my city, away from the home, and also asked her to take 2 weeks work-off, so to see if any of those are triggers and she can experiment a new place with new routine.
- She met a therapist, she felt not okay. then found another therapist. then we checked a psychiatrist and they gave some tablets, and now one of her senior folk at work suggested to get second opinion - so we might be visiting this new psychiatrist as well. IDK man. Is jumping one expert after one expert with just one session is good? idk, she feels not okay and I dont want to force.
Few more observations.
- She has her ups and downs. She is active most time, and dull and drained most times. And sneak upto her room when people are bit busy and cut herself.
- She says her head is paining a lot to an extent she wants to cut her. Not sure how to deal with this.
- But if it comes to meeting her friends, or something thats important to her, she makes up her mind somehow and does that. Like even though she was dull throughout the evening, she just gets up to meet them. I will be canceled for asking this, but can she put the same motivation to not cut herself?
- Also I feel like she knowing a lot of depression and the symptoms of depression (because of her work), she overthought to an extent, she started feeling this? Can this be possible? Again, I know I will be cancelled. but if that is case, I can ask her to consider different field with her MSW degree. (something other than healthcare)
- She listens to depressed songs, sad songs, reads only sad books. Is that normal? I mean, again as a rational approach, shouldnt we not go deep into the rabbit hole that tries to kill us?

I might have left some details. But I can help once we have some inputs coming in. Cause I am confused. I have made my family and people to act certain way to not trigger her or something, but not sure how long they will do this considering they might not have a greater understanding about what's happening. So I need to understand this as well.

I know we should deal with kindness and so, but is there a chance, that could be taken advantage to stay the same way, like not putting in necessary efforts? I know I read through so many posts, and people said they might not have the energy to even wake up from the bed, but then how to go towards healing?",mentalhealth

some context: my mother also struggles mentally and all throughout my childhood i have seen her in and out of physciatric wards, her most vunreable moments, and scary moments. i still dont know what shes diagnosed with but from what i can assume i think it might be BPD?? she has told me straight up she just has a bit of depression and anxiety but i know its more than that

shes fought with my dad for years and years and i need to know whether these fights are abusive or normal.

it usually starts with me hearing screaming, whether on the phone or in person (irl hasnt happened for a while) i will hear my mother scream and cry and accuse my dad of things like cheating, sneaking around and other outrageous things. she says pretty horrific things to him and i dont know the full story obviouslt and i dont rlly know what he says back, but from what hes told me, he doesnt know why this happens and she blows up for seemingly no reason. my dad has sat in my room crying to me not knowing what to do or what hes done wrong and all i know is that he would never do alot of those things (this doesnt mean hes perfect or anything he also says some pretty hurtful things to my mum but i know his character)

its so hard to summarize this but when she gets like this, she will kick him out throw his stuff away call him and his family dirty names and so on. thats just with him.... but with me?

me and my mother have explosive arguments aswell.

for example i get extremely mad and my anger gets so bad that i dont know how to control it and i will be very destructive. throw things, multiple holes in walls, hurt myself yell etc. these arguments dont really come from much, it could be as simple as me getting mad that she isnt listening to me (i usually get mad first) and then all of a sudden i go from 0 to 100 and punch my wall scream my lungs out and whatevers closest to me gets hit or hurt, even if i dont mean it (ive hurt my pets a few times) it feels like i dont have any control in these moments like im so hot and and being burned alive and my body just throws a punch or gets taken over by something and then immediately after i dont know why i did that and start crying because i dont feel like i even did that. i feel so guilty and ashamed of myself and then i just freeze

so anyway when i get mad she gets mad aswell and does very similar things to me. some things  happen: she has threatened to get me taken away multiple times, threatens to call the cops or ambulance, almost everytime she takes my entire door off and i dont get it back. my door handles broken from being smashed and my door has holes from her banging trying to get in. she takes all my devices and its just overall very scary and i get called very similar things to when she fights with my dad. its so scary and i feel so unsafe. it never gets physical tho.

the next day after this would happen, she would wake me up saying ""hi darling do u want breakfast i love you"" ,be laughing on the phone to friends, cleaning the house doing normal things and i cant help but be so confused. how can u do that to me and act normal after.

after this happens i always hate her so much to the point i cant handle it, but i also have a side of me that misses her. i dont want to be mad at her, i know she loves me more than anything in the world and does everything for me, i feel bad for her because i know that shes not perfect and that shes very similar to me. i know the way she was treated by her parents and i want to forgive her but i cant because of what she has put me through. she always says how much she misses me, and seeing her face sadden when i dont reciprocate affection is terrible, and hearing her cry behind closed doors. i just want to get rid of the wall ive built and just want to give her a hug but i cant let myself open up my heart to her because i dont know how long untill theres another scary moment, and shes treating me like im trash.",mentalhealth

My parents are still wrapping up a shitty divorce because my mother is a narcissist and abusive piece of crap. She did everything she could to keep me and my brother away from seeing my dad. I was basically used as a trophy and treated that I should shut up and be a spectacle than be heard. Sort like an accomplishment that I was stuck with her and not him.

My dad describes me as I was a shell of a human being. I'm five years my dad has one video of me laughing and none of me looking genuinely happy in photos. 

Two years ago I managed to get the guts to run and move in with my dad after over six years of that hell hole. I've been depressed since I was 8, and have a skin picking disorder that was a majority of my s/h throughout the years. 

Living with my dad is good, so much better than where I was, I've started to try and rebuild. But things are quickly starting to spiral again. I'm so frustrated because I feel so alone. I started to rebuild enough that I understand that I'm no longer needing to hide all the time so locking myself away feels like genuine loneliness and I don't know what to do. Hiding and shutting up is all I know to do.
I've been put back into school, and over the years I've been lucky enough to continue advancing through grades even though I've never gotten anything except a few lucky grades and I honestly don't know how I got through 8 and 9. 

But now I'm in a new grade and I'm juggling 7 classes for just this semester. So I'm really struggling to try and keep up even though we've barely started. I'm already getting behind in a couple classes because I feel so burnt out and done with life.

My dad works full time so I barely get to see him when he wakes me up and then leaves for work and I sleep in until much later since I don't feel I can actually get up when he wants me to. Plus I've struggled with insomnia for many years so going to bed early has been really hard. 

My dad comes home around five or six and by the end of the day he doesn't want to do anything but watch the news. And once he's done watching the news he gets on the phone and talks with his new girlfriend who lives a couple hours for us practically the rest of the night. On Tuesdays he's also busy, on Wednesdays he helps at a recovery group late into the evening (around 10) after work so he's barely home for an hour. And then Thursdays he has meetings for his recovery group. And Fridays I have a youth group to attend that I've started to go to less and less.

So I barely see him, I feel like I can't connect with him since I'm stuck at home, alone, on my own for hours. I have no interest in dating or anything, but whenever I bring anything like that up my dad teases me about boys and it really irritates me more than I think it should. But a whole lifetime of having all my feelings downplayed like that makes me feel like I'm back at square one.

I feel like I'm losing my dad to his girlfriend and I know that's probably a selfish thought. As I write this I'm alone in the house with nothing to do except watch TV and draw because he's travelled a couple hours to be with her. I don't have many friends except one I talk to on the internet who lives in a completely different country.

I'm completely losing interest in things I once loved. I'm so caught up and anxious about school, trying to battle seven classes and the teachers constantly telling me to pursue things when I don't have the time. Or feel I don't. Starting in an art class my art is starting to feel like a task more than something fun and I'm scrutinizing it so much more. It's not fun anymore. I don't have any time to play my guitar and learn. All my videogames I've played a hundred times and I don't have anything new. My family can't afford to get a new ps since my PS3 is dying out. I don't mean to sound selfish or like I want this, I genuinely just want something else that might make me feel happy. 

I feel so numb and like I have to compete for my dad again after just getting him back. 

He's been my lifeline and there's so much else I could spill onto the table. 

I felt pushed to make this post because one of my friends recently hung himself because of false pedophile accusations by some kids doing it as a joke and have zero remorse. I've tried to stay away from a bunch of social media platforms and haven't taken an interest in them because of shit like this that happens. I honestly don't know where to go from here. I want to die without offing myself, I just want to simply not exist. 
And with all the crap happening in the world it doesn't help. And therapy is pretty much the last option because of it's cost, and I have almost no way to get there because I'm still struggling to get a driver's license.

Worst of all I can't even cry. With all the shit in my life and how horrible I feel I haven't been able to shed more than a few tears. I feel like I could cry a river and feel some relief but I can't even have that..

I feel slightly better just dumping a bunch of this stuff. Apologies for it being so long, I tried to keep it as short as possible.


Tldr: I'm close to completely giving up, feeling numb and losing all interest in my passions. And back in fight mode over a relationship with my dad I just seemed to get back.",mentalhealth

1697312861.0,"I'm 15, feel like my life has been on pause for the last 5 years. Help.","I'm gonna start out by saying I'm not particularly great at writing or grammar, and this will probably be a mess of different thoughts as I don't know what else to do.

**A little about me:**

I'm 15, from Australia and I moved the the UK \~4 years ago. I have autism and ADHD (Only got diagnosed last year), I have always been on the chubby side(Due to no interest in sports and I like baking) but over the past few years I'm now overweight. 

I would say I am a very sheltered child, I have no brothers and sisters and my family is comfortable financially. I love my parents and they do everything they can and only want the best for me. I was a B grade student and had enough friends in Australia.

**The Problem/Story (I don't even know, I've never written anything like this before)**

Up until I was about 9, I was very happy and content(with a few bullying hiccups along the way). I got moved to a different school which was a highschool so there were older students, I also was the only one from my previous school who moved there so I had no friends, eventually I made some but there were some real assholes and I seriously thought about killing myself. I had also been exposed to porn and drugs by older students (I refused drugs but it was still in the environment.) Then when I was 10/11, My father got a job in the UK, I don't think it payed much more but my parents wanted to experience living in another country, I was openly against this and didn't want to move. We arrived in the UK right as covid hit, so a lot of things were closed. Eventually I joined a school and because Au and UK school years start at different times, I was joining in halfway through a curriculum I didn't know. I struggled to make any friends as people made fun of my accent and I didn't understand the street lingo or culture. I went to this school for about a year. Also during this time I got a gaming laptop for my birthday and I started a downwards spiral into severe gaming addiction. I replaced needing real friends with online friends and I sunk over 4000 hours into games in about 3 years. 

After I was struggling so much at this school, my parents pulled me out and enrolled me into an online school, I really struggled with ADHD symptoms which led to me being unable to do the work without being distracted by video games or youtube or twitch etc. My parents then took me out of this for a year so I could trial medication (Such a long time because waiting times were astronomical). Over this year I basically had no social interaction and rarely went outside, I had no friends to meet with as I had made none since we came here.And here we are now, this school year. To be fair, i've really tried hard at doing the schoolwork this year and I'm doing okay. But I'm quite literally terrified to go outside and to talk to people other than my parents. I feel like I haven't changed since I was 9, I have the same skillset, I don't think I'm any smarter or have gained anything from the past few years. I decided to quit games and now I'm so incredibly lonely as now I don't even have my online friends to talk to. I have been going to the gym for a while with my dad, lost a bit of weight but that is it. I don't even know who i am anymore, I don't know what I'm interested in, I don't know what I like doing, I.. just don't know. I used to love drawing and reading books when I was younger but I feel no attraction towards them now, I want friends but I don't know how to find any, I don't even know what to say in a conversation anymore. 

Sorry if that was hard to read, I'm lost at what to do.

1697312776.0,URGENT - Suffering from anxiety & panic attacks for weeks,"I'll try to be short and concise

About 2 weeks ago my girlfriend started getting major anxiety attacks, which is warranted because she was under stress from a number of factors: *(roommate moving out, big exams, health concerns from putting pressure on herself to go to lots of workout classes, and feeling on the urge of passing out after every workout class)*

She has had a 2 month anxiety episode similar to this years ago, but not at this level.

It's like she has spiraled down into a dark hole and can't get out. Some moments are better than others, but it's now very very hard for her to do anything. She is feeling constant sadness and strong anxiety, to the point of having panic attacks in public. She can't drive, she can't go to the grocery store, she can't even get in the car with me to pick her mom up from the airport. It's as if she is waiting on/expecting something bad to happen, at all times.

The only thing that helps (a little bit) is playing her video game and watching TV, which helps her to not focus on the anxiety, but if she's not doing either of those 2 things, she is back to feeling like shit. She has barely left her apartment and is in bed 95% of the day. Her mom and I have tried to help her get out of her room, but every she does she starts believing she'll have another panic attack, which leads to another panic attack. She's told me she can't stop thinking, it's a non-stop flow of thoughts that make her feel like shit. Most notably always thinking about ""when will this go away"" and ""will I be like this forever?"" which only makes it worse on her.

I don't know how to help her, but I'm being as supportive as I can be without trying to tell her ""do this"" and ""try that.""

We both live out of state where her primary care is, but we were able to get her some medication a few days ago for the anxiety, but it only helps a little bit. She has a phone call with a psychiatrist on Monday, but that's about it.

I don't know what to do, or how to help.

Any suggestions is appreciated.",mentalhealth
1697312127.0,I'm worried and need serious advice for my sister,"This will be a long one so if you either don't have the time or patience I won't hold it against you. For the others, please bear with me. I'm in dire need of advice. I don't know how to handle a situation like this but I fear that if I don't make an effort, things will get much worse.

I have an older sister who I love dearly. She has helped me numerous times in the past and I simply owe her a lot. She made it clear to me what I wanted to do most with my future in a part of my life where I was seriously lost mentally.

Today my sister had an overall bad mood and whenever that's the case, I just follow her orders, do what I can to help while being understanding as best I can so that she neither gets the impression, that I don't care nor think that she's a tyrant and I'm afraid of her (I used to be afraid of her when I was younger,  since she would scream at me for doing something stupid or selfish). Then as the day got closer to the evening she seemed seriously fed up and said that she has an anxiety attack. 

She wasn't hyperventilating, visibly shacking or screaming but was simply pissed. So I thought the best course of action would be to give her some space since she didn't want to talk about it. 

Obviously, something triggered her. There were several times in the past where she got extremely angry at us (me, second oldest sister and mother) about something due to our laziness/negligence (like not properly cleaning the kitchen or cooking too late since she hates to eat dinner past 8 pm.) 

Then later at the dinner table, as we were eating, she tears up. Our mother came home from work 15 min before and already asked what was wrong as soon as she saw her but she insisted that she didn't want to talk about it and pursuing the question would have angered her more (it has in the past when she was upset). Our mom is that type of person that would want to say anything rather than nothing just to fill in the silence so she pretended that nothing was wrong. 

Our household started fairly toxic with our father having serious trust issues with everyone around him and assertiveness/aggressiveness against any stranger. Things only got worse once he started collecting serious debt and then would physically abuse our mom. She divorced him and he had to go to jail for a year but that was for another reason on top that I can't get into. All of this happened pretty early in our life (I was roughly 5 to 8 and my oldest sis roughly 13 to 16 years old).

My sister always has been very controlling of my life. There've been cases where she seriously pissed me off, with me saying some messed up things to her, but I've always immediately after regretted it and apologized. The story above probably contributed to her need of control alongside her being the oldest. On top of that, when I was born our parents told her that she needs to be the one to look after me and apparently I was **her** responsibility. Maybe not the best thing to say to an 8 year old but I'm probably just overanalyzing. 

I can't say whether or not she's facing a form of depression but I'm seriously afraid, that she might have very negative thoughts. She once visited a therapist that our mom goes to and absolutely hated it due to them being too much of a ""and how does that make you feel?"" therapist (too passive).

I've tried to talk with her about things but I either don't know what to say or she just isn't convinced of what I'm trying to tell her. Our mom ain't a big help too, since she just patronizes her constantly.

Please give me some advice, it's just not fair for her.

1697298539.0,Dissociation? Weird mirror thing?,"Yesterday, my mom was pretty drunk, and it got me thinking lots about my whole childhood. It really messed with my head, and I think I had a rage attack. I started throwing stuff around in anger. After doing that for a while (and accidentally hurting myself in the process), I, without much thought, just grabbed my coat and went outside.  
  
I walked for a while. It started to thunder and rain, but I continued. It was pretty late (around 11 p.m.). I kept walking in places that had no lights or were generally unsafe.  
  
Once I made it back home, I immediately went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. My eyes were weirdly wide open, and for some reason, it seemed like my face was moving?  
  
I then went to my room. What I'm a bit worried about is that I don't remember anything that happened next. Once I woke up, my phone was dead, which is really weird since I always charge it before I sleep. I still feel pretty weirded out by the whole situation.

All of my friends are long-distance right now, and they think that I'm happy and killing it. I'm trying so hard to let them know that I've been struggling again but I can't bring myself to say it. My friend on the phone the other day even said, ""it makes me so happy to know that you've been doing so well."" How am I supposed to tell him at this point that I'm not.

It's been a while since I last SH'd, but I got really close to relapsing yesterday. I know I can't do it right now because I'm moving abroad soon.

1697306593.0,All of these fucking mental health subs have the opposite fucking effect on me,"What is the point of venting on a sub, hoping for someone to notice and genuinely show support, when I have to fight others for it. All I wanna do is shout at people to help me. All I need is to just clickbait people and snatch a lifeboat away from others. It's fucking dehumanizing to come here and hope someone will just help me a tiny bit out of my worst fucking episodes, only to be ignored. I saw a month back someone begging for upvotes on r/SuicideWatch and receiving hundreds. Literally just telling people ""Hey, I feel a little sad, updoots to the left"". Fucking braindead, all of you. All of the people, who fall for this. Even in my darkest moment, all I am is a contestant in a sick game show marketplace, competing for the affection of the burgeoisie. Like real life, like school, like jobs, like everything. No place in my life is safe from having to compete with others and dance for others sick entertainment.

And I can't talk to people either without being met with the same cookie cutter responses. The truth is no one knows the specifics of my problems and can only recommend me the most bare bones stuff. ""Go to therapy."" Very fucking cool, I have social phobia and the waiting lists extend into one year from now. ""Oh, you're not that horrible."" I don't fucking care, all I care about is to finally fit into society and not fear other people. ""Oh, I know a site for your problems."" Chances are, I've seen em. It's like talking to AI bots and having to specify every part of your sentence to fit into the language recognition algorithms of the other person. And then I still look back and get a response and realize I should've said this or that instead. So I might as well have shut up, since I get nothing out of it. Even now, pick a flair to signal to people, whether you state pre-approved opinions or whether you're being silly goofy and just angey. That way you can signal to people, what their pre-approved opinions on the post are. You can't talk about that yourself. FUCK YOU IM NOT JUST ANGRY MAYBE MY ANGER IS BASED ON SOMETHING REAL

And I can't show my true face either. I wanna just go somewhere and shout how much I fucking hate people. How much I want people, who remind me of myself too much, dead. How I'm ready to pull the trigger every day now. I have all the chemicals I need and can end this shit now. I am fucking ready. I just want to show my true colours. But due to fucking Reddit rules, all I can do is shyly imply my hatred and my issues, so that people can shyly talk me down. When no, this isn't a small issue in my life. It's everything, IT IS EVERY SECOND OF MY LIFE NOW. ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS THIS. My last thread got fucking locked, because I was too much of a fucking moron. All people giving out opinions about mental health, when they'd kick someone in the chin for having a symptom that affects them. You support me only when it doesn't personally fucking affect you.

So go on, ignore this post too, play a charade like everyone else, try and talk about the same points as before. I'm ready. All these mental health subreddits gave me is a profound hatred for every aspect of humanity. If I was in the Oval Office right now, I'd drop the nukes on the whole world and wipe out all of humanity. There's nothing more to fucking save. Human unintelligence was a mistake and I wish someone was smart enough to end the worst experiment in history. BURN ALL OF IT",mentalhealth

1697292818.0,Is it ‚Äúnormal‚Äù not to be interested in forming new relationships?,"I‚Äôm not really interested in actively meeting new people or becoming more than acquaintances with people. I am pretty sure I‚Äôm also aromantic, so I feel no desire to have a romantic relationship. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt care about people- I care about my family and my lifelong best friends, and I consider myself a pretty empathetic person. However, I don‚Äôt care to form or keep new relationships. I‚Äôve had many friends that have come and gone throughout my teen years (I‚Äôm 22 now) and I realize now that my parents don‚Äôt try and encourage me to make friends/hang out with people, I don‚Äôt really miss them. I feel bad for saying that; they were all nice people, don‚Äôt get me wrong! There‚Äôs no way to say it without sounding mean, but I guess I don‚Äôt care about my old friends enough to try and maintain or rekindle relationships with them. I have 2 friends I consider close, aside from family. I‚Äôm also pretty close with my brother, in that I tell him things about my life I wouldn‚Äôt tell my parents or other siblings. I enjoy hanging out with these 3, and I care about them and their happiness. One has been my best friend for the majority of my life and I feel very blessed to have her. I guess I don‚Äôt feel like I need any other close relationships. I‚Äôm not interested in dating at all, and sometimes I think I‚Äôd like to have sex but ultimately I mostly feel indifferent about it and I think I‚Äôd be fine just fantasizing instead.

I don‚Äôt feel lonely or like I need to form new relationships, so this is not ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù in the sense of causing distress or wanting to fix it. I am just wondering, is this very unusual? It seems like everyone else is really invested in romance, in making new friends, puts in a lot of effort to keep up with old friends etc but I don‚Äôt really care.

1697292107.0,I need advice how to get better,"I actually don‚Äôt know how to start. I have mental problems for 3 years now which started with panic attacks, I was thinking I‚Äôm going to die, wanted to escape somewhere even I didn‚Äôt know where, my head, hands and legs were going extremely numb I was sure I was having a stroke or heart attack.

Those things suddenly stopped until one night a thought occurred while I was sleeping with my girlfriend and it went like ‚Äúwhat if you stab and kill her while she sleeps‚Äù I was extremely panicked, I thought I‚Äôm crazy, I‚Äôm a bad person, and so on. I felt like I‚Äôm going to do that, I was really drowning‚Ä¶ and those thoughts just switched from my girlfriend to my mother, to my friends‚Ä¶ it was horrible.

I went to neurologist and he prescribed me SSRIs, two types, I had to take 1/4 3 times a day from one of them and one whole pill from the other, I was taking them for I think 9 months, then I stopped, then things got worse again I started them second time for a short period.

Now I‚Äôm off meds for year and a half, and I‚Äôm feeling worse again. Please tell me what to do I don‚Äôt want to live that way anymore, I‚Äôm desperate. I have intrusive thoughts that I‚Äôll punch my girl, or when she‚Äôs not around that I‚Äôll punch myself. It even got to the point where my head gets numb every time I come back from work and kiss her for hello. I can‚Äôt sleep well, and when I don‚Äôt have these harm thoughts I have others that I‚Äôm going crazy because I feel detached from reality sometimes, confused and not clearly thinking.

I‚Äôm afraid of being alone but at the same time I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll hurt people next to me. I read so many things maybe I have OCD, maybe anxiety, maybe both, I don‚Äôt know I just want it to stop and I want to lead a normal life. Please if someone goes trough the same thing, give me advice.

I'm a 17yo girl who's seeking for help. I live with my parents. My dad is too strict and protective with me and mom is abusive. She's always lying and insulting me for no apparent reason. She actually says she has a reason but they are lies, those things never happened and were never said. She threatens me. She says that I'm killing her and I'm gonna cry over her death. She says she's the one who's being abused and also that she's the only good person in the house. But she makes me feel invalid for my pain and my emotions.  According to her I'm always happy and I WANT to make her feel bad just bc I'm bored. How am I supposed to want that when I'm the one who cries while she screams pretending not to be screaming? She always reminds me that the pain I caused her is bigger than the one she felt when her mother, her niece and her sister died.

1697287838.0,I don't understand the pint,"I'll start with saying this is not a pity party nor am I trying to garner validation.
I grew up in a very abusive household dad left very early on, I was left with with a violent uncle and a spiteful drunk of a mother who favouritised my sister (my sister actually confirmed this, she is disgusted about it and has called mother out about it)
My school life was me being cruelly bullied, not much physical but always verbal and psychological, and at best I was just left out.
I didn't even get to leave the nightmare of my mother's house until I was in my early 20s.

I have no friends because for some reason they always leave me, I am always there for people but not a pushover, I can't keep friends and I started to wonder if it was me? Or was I doing something that I didn't know was wrong? I literally can't think of anything.

I have a longtime gf but I don't dare tell her about anything I'm going through most of the time because I can't explain it to her and I know she has a mountain of her own issues which she is going through.

It's not that she doesn't care, she just can't dedicate her time and mental energy to it because she has a lot of her own problems.

I have thought about ending it so many times, but truth is, what is the point?
If the afterlife exists then I am not going anywhere nice and if it doesn't and we just stop existing then I'll get there soon enough anyway, I can list all the places right on the spot of where I chose that if I did that's where I would.

I struggle to be happy in the moment because I know I'm not in the grander scheme.

I am not good at anything, and I know that I am not, please don't tell me I am at something I am really not.

I am quite unintelligent, slow to learn and I can't learn things as quick as most.

I have no qualities that make anything doable without a huge struggle, I suppose really I am just so tired of life and and everything that it involves.

I wish I could just stop existing completely, I have no purpose in this world, I am just here with no purpose.

I just needed to put this somewhere, I have no other outlet to do this.

1697301126.0,I'm tired. I want help but I don't know where to look for it,"This turned pretty long, I'm sorry if it's inappropriate in any way, I just wanted a place to let it all out and maybe get some advice if anyone ever felt this way.

I've been feeling very bad for years, I tried going to three different therapists at different points of my life. The last one told me I use a coping mechanism where I push something under the rug so I would avoid negative feelings, this is why it took me so long to realise something was wrong with me. Every time something happens I use maladaptive daydreaming to imagine a life where I have everything this one is lacking. It mostly being understanding friends that I feel good being around. I noticed in the last year that I started spending more and more of my time maladaptive daydreaming, because I feel like,  outside of my family whom I love very much,  there is nothing else for me here. But I am aware I am wasting away at my life and one day I will regret it. Yet I can't do anything to change my behavior, because everything seems boring. Taking a walk alone is boring and lonely and scary sometimes because people on the street look at me weird (because of my short hair i guess). 

I never feel comfortable, in my body (gender dysphoria), in my behavior. The fact that I'm a people pleaser has ruined me. Yet on a good day if you ask me how I am, I'll say great. It's only the bad days that hit me like a truck and it makes me realise how much shit I put up with, but then I go back to sweeping it under the rug and thinking I'm dramatic. I don't have the energy for my family, to call them and spend time with them. I'm always tired but I don't know what from. Everyone thinks I'm lazy, but I am just too worn out, not even feeling like doing the things I used to love, let alone doing chores or similar. My memory is bad, I forgot a lot of basic things that middle school students should know. I have OCD but I'm used to living with intrusive thoughts and obsessive habits and thoughts of ""if i don't put my perfume on 5 times someone will die"". But I guess that too can wear me out. I'm angry all the time, thinking of all the times people bullied me, harassed me, made me feel like I'm not worth being alive, and I just let it happen. I don't know what's wrong with me honestly. It's just a little bit of everything but it's obvious I did this to myself with my anxiety and overthinking. I don't know how to stop.

I come home from work and don't feel like doing anything until tomorrow when I work again, I only cry because I get 4 hours after work for myself, I keep thinking ""this can't be how I spend the rest of my life"". I want to quit work but my family lives easier since we got one more paycheck in the house. I am finally not a burden, I'm contributing. If I told them I want to take a few months off just to sit with myself and figure it out, my dad will have to take on all the burden, financially. I don't want to trouble him like that again. I just finished college and my sister started hers.

I only have energy to scroll on my phone. Yet I have these overwhelming thoughts that I'm wasting my life, and I want to do so many things. I want to spend time in the nature, and learn to play the guitar (I've been trying to start for 12 years?? It's insane that I still haven't when I want it so much). I want to do so many things but I don't have the energy for anything. I should probably continue with this therapist but she's so expensive and we've spent months without any improvement (in my opinion), all she told me is that I have OCD, which is so obvious honestly, but all the other things she didn't help with, it feels like she's stalling or something, I don't know I just want to feel okay. She did tell me I'm putting on a mask because i want to entertain people, i want them to feel good in my presence, but then after when i stop doing it and want to show them my real personality, they don't like me anymore, so i go back to it. She called me a Jester. I think of dying sometimes, i dont want to die, i really dont. But i feel like it will be the same in the end since im not really living. It's overwhelming,  like a cycle that keeps repeating and I want out, I get these panicked thoughts that I can't take it anymore and in those moments I have to do something but I don't know what, I don't think of really hurting myself but logically it's the only way to stop feeling like that every day. 

I'm wondering if getting a prescription for some pills that will motivate me (dopamine or serotonin i forgot and i dont have the energy to google, yes it's that bad lol), is better than trying to find my own way out. Two of my therapists suggested it (as a last resort after basically telling me they can't help and giving up on me). Cause I've been going down, for years and i don't know how to help myself when even showering is hard. I wonder if I'll be more proud of myself if i make it on my own, without pills. Or should I just take them and get this torture over with. I wonder if i'll get addicted to pills and if i try to stop taking them will i feel even worse.

My mum atleast for the first 6 years of my life constantly put me in the care of my grandma (Dad's mum) after the age of 6 it was limited to weekends because of school.
Throughout the years I've been remembering more And more shit from my past. Such as my grandma (mum's mum) literally threatening me with suicide anytime I came home with a bad grade... I was in third grade at the time. Next was my mum's horrible boyfriend which we moved in with. He forced me to rip my own tooth out, sat me down for 5 hours writing a stupid sentence from a book because my writing wasn't ""perfect"" And took me to some big Playground where I almost died. What did my mum do? I hear you ask? nothing. And years later she still denies any of it happening.
Lets skip ahead. To this day whenever there Is a disagreement I get threatened or insulted or belittled. Other times they Are sweet enough but then they pull stupid shit like this And I can never say no to anything. I can't even set proper boundaries because they completely ignore them or again insult And threaten me. Again there Is a mess somewhere And WHO gets blamed? Me.
I hate this fuckin house with all my heart I don't even Have a say in what can be in my room, and anytime someone visits or even just throughout the day they just BARGE IN MY ROOM WITHOUT KNOCKING OR ANYTHING AND THEN THEY INSULT ME FOR HAVING A PERCEIVED MESS DESPITE THE ROOM NOT EVEN BEING MESSY. 

There Is So much stupidity And bullshit but posts Have a character limit as far as I am Aware so feel free to ask in the comments And I might make a post about other much more idiotic shit in my life.
This Is a sort of vent post but seriously Tell me Is this abuse? Because if I brought this up to the people I am talking about in this post they'd just say ""Thats normal"" or ""That never happened you [random insult]""",mentalhealth

1697284234.0,Negative outlook on future,"For context I (24M) just graduated college and it took me about a year to find a job in my field. So close on so many 2nd and 3rd interviews for salaries of 60-70k which is reasonable for the NY area. I ended up getting an offer for a little over 40k and took it because something is better than nothing. I have about 50k in student loans and had to take on a car payment to get to work reliably. Now I am in the office doing something kind of unrelated to my field 45-50 hours a week no OT, and after taxes, health insurance, and just student loan payments I end up with about 15 an hour which is absolutely horrible in this area and id make more working at a fucking Amazon warehouse 50 hours a week. If I moved out of my moms house with these rent prices I‚Äôd be left with basically no money. It‚Äôs hard to accept I will never own a home, never be able to support a family without struggling. I struggled throughout my teens and college and hoped it would be different once I graduated but no. I had a pretty rough childhood so my mental state was already shit and because of this I‚Äôm even worse I self harm like once a week and idk what to do I‚Äôve never been this bad before. Sorry for the rant but I need help.

I‚Äôve never sought help for mental health before but I think it‚Äôs long overdue. Idk how any of it works though like if I have depression does a doctor or a therapist diagnose me?

1697282630.0,How to be institutionalized in Canada,"Hello, I was wondering what the steps would be to have myself committed to psychiatric facility in Canada? Preferably with minimal cost/ estimations as I make very little money.

I‚Äôve been struggling with suicidal thoughts since I was 7 and first diagnosed with clinical depression then. I‚Äôve only acquired a laundry list of diagnoses, I try to be a productive member of society (go to school on scholarships, work multiple jobs and volunteer when possible) but I‚Äôm at my limit. For days now I‚Äôll go 25+ hours without sleeping because I‚Äôm so anxious, then pass out for 6 and the cycle repeats.

 I feel I‚Äôm a danger to myself as I‚Äôve relapsed heavily into self harm to cope with recent life events (homelessness while fleeing domestic violence, I was raped and SA‚Äôd multiple times this year, and the man who killed my father was let off in court with a fine because the police destroyed evidence after failing to investigate properly.)

1697281259.0,Parents died during the covid crises and now I am like a ghost,"M24. So my parents died two years ago during the covid crisis one after the another and I have been through a range of emotions since then. My home was taken over over by the landlord so I had two weeks to take my stuff from a home in which I had lived all my life and leave for my relatives in the same city. First 1 and a half month it was disbelief and absolute break down of my ability to work. So my relatives sent me to my uncle and aunt known for the strictness and discipline ""for correctional purposes"" within a week or two I was at odds with my aunt due to the unkind things she used to say about my parents that they should have been more strict with me they coddled me and I shouldn't voice my opinions and I should have figured by life out by now. This bred resentment and anger towards her deep rooted anger that is and went into a silent bubble for almost 9 months . I have always been a guy that followed my passion but nevertheless I took up a generic corporate job and saved up money to leave the place even though my aunt was not allowing me to leave and we had arguments about that too. Then I moved to another city away from all the relatives and it has been two years since everything has happened and I have switched jobs too which align with my passion too but now I feel completely hollow and empty. I am living with you could say a group of friends who I met in the new city but I see them happy with their families whenever they visit or they're significant others but me I feel I am unable to associate with anything or anyone completely hollow and see through sure I go to work I am also the weird comic relief in my office and friend groups (at least I believe so) but I can't seem to feel anything I want a bond or a connection but I run away as soon as someone tries that I emotionally rebuke them I sometimes turn towards alcoholism to forget my hollowness to feel something.

It's been 9 days since I received a call from my nephew (my best friends eldist) telling me that his Dad was dead.

Her place is only 10 minutes away from ours, so I rushed oved there and law enforcement had the place taped up as a crime scene and he was still in the back yard. Mom, my wife, myself and the police all sat there waiting in her living room waiting for the coroner while he was just a few feet behind me with only a brick wall. After the police left, my mother described in detail what she saw when she opened the door. Descriptive details of his body position. 

I have constant flashbacks and intrusive thoughts related to that morning. Im very triggered by certain words, and when people mention death casually, I start to get triggered. I'm an ICU nurse with over a decade of experience,, so I've dealth with trauma and intense sorrowful situations, but this is just absolutely crippling at times.

I‚Äôve always struggled, i‚Äôve had really bad anxiety for most of my teenage years. I‚Äôve had bad days here and there that ultimately developed into bad weeks. But it always got better. I recieved therapy for emetophobia from march-august. I felt the best i ever had during early august.

However as august drew to a close, and exam results got nearer, i got worse and worse. I didn‚Äôt leave the house, i could barely get up. I blamed this on exam stress, but looking back i don‚Äôt think that was it.

Results day came around and i did good (all As and A*s). But i didn‚Äôt feel happy. I knew how to act happy and look happy but i just didn‚Äôt feel it. School started a week or so after that and it just got worse and worse. 

My confidence has gone down so much, and my anxiety surrounding emetophobia is slowly creeping back into my life. The only place i go is school, and even now im finding it difficult to get up in the morning and go. I love school, i love the subjects that im doing and i love the routine, but im just not enjoying anything.

He would be on and off drugs as well but was sober when my mom wasn‚Äôt. He starting struggling and felt it was unfair for him to take care of us by himself which resorted into him relapsing into drugs as well. He would also beat my sister occasionally if she didn‚Äôt clean the house or cook when she was only 11/12. Once my dad relapsed he stopped working and got us evicted.

1697269384.0,How do I get more help for depression/anxiety?,"Hi all! I was looking for support in the form of what in the world should I be doing to get more help? What does the path look like? There's a lot going on with me and im verbose, which can understandably irritate some people so if you want to stop here before context I understand! The main question is just what is a concrete path to finding more about the root cause of my depression and anxiety so that it can be tackled more efficiently?

I'm in therapy currently, I really like this style (somatic) and therapist, she has taught me a lot. I've done DBT and talk therapy in the past too. My mental health, which I have basically always struggled with, has improved a lot since high school. I was raised in an abusive/dysfunctional household, and I also suspect maybe being born with something that was never diagnosed. But... its still effecting my life and now relationship negatively at 25. I seem to have a cycle of maybe 1-2 weeks holding it together, then start to get increasingly overwhelmed by stress caused by work, chores, socializing, life events, plain ol pointless background anxiety etc until im past my tolerance level and am just an anxious overstimulated mess, then depressed mess as a result of that, for 2-4 weeks.

I am at the point that my partner of 8 years is overwhelmed by me and my ""constant"" stress/overthinking/negativity. I understand. It hurts nonetheless. He needs me to take more steps to control these spirals. Its at the point that he is so spent from my stress cycles that as im approaching them - i notice them earlier due to my somatic therapy -  and try so hard to keep it under control, he is getting frustrated with me after only a few days, which makes me feel unsupported and isolated, so i spiral faster and harder since i feel like im suffering and being blamed/invalidated. Again, I understand the position hes in. Thats just my perspective.

So his plan is trying to find professionals that can help me find the root cause - lifestyle, hormone levels, chemical imbalance, comorbid conditions, diagnosis etc so i can find solutions to deal with it on top of weekly therapy. Medication terrifies me, but im open to it.

I jumped the gun last week after another fight, since i still hadnt contacted any professionals since our last fight, I emailed and did a phone consult with a psychologist (thought it was a psychiatrist at first) my therapist referred me to. I say jumped the gun, because i made the phone consult for 2 days later after an unusual 6am workshift on 4 hours of sleep, without discussing with my therapist any of it or organizing any of my notes.. I was trying to show my partner im taking him seriously, and i have social anxiety/phone phobia so I was trying to bite the bullet so i couldnt put it off. Bad idea, basically feel like i choked. I had such a hard time understanding the evaluations he offers even after an hour on the phone. In the end I was offered an autism evaluation (which i inquired about, I suspect it or adhd) and a neuropsych eval instead of psych eval? Which doesnt sound right, it may be because i mentioned autism/adhd?

I'm going to discuss this next week with my therapist properly. But until then i would love some advice or support, Im going nuts knowing im hurting my partner so much, feeling really down about feeling broken/wrong/like a victim tbh, even like an imposter now that im in an upswing after an honestly really bad downswing. And completely anxious, even irritated that i just have no idea what im doing. The path isnt clear and not knowing what im doing is a huge trigger. My therapist even suggested getting a psych evaluation isnt the way to go - I thought getting a proper eval therefore mental illness diagnosis would be the first step to open up resources for care plans?

Im really just...lost. Thanks for reading if you did.

1697282733.0,i think i am ready to settle into the disappointment mentality,"
i am here to lay it all out and pour my truth and soul into this, and ask for your genuine feedback

I really feel like i am screwed. i am going to be completely transparent and say that i am most definitely an asshole, who is selfish/ greedy and most definitely a narcissist. For some reason i have this narrative in my head that everyone and everything around me is solely focused on picking out my flaws and my issues even though i know that nobody actually cares.  i work so hard to look like and be like my ‚Äúown character‚Äù or my ‚Äúown self‚Äù but i always feel like i am copying someone else. i feel like people are constantly watching my every move and waiting to pick out my issues and put them on display for everyone else to see. I feel like this is impartially to do with the fact that a lot of people see me as fake and unreal and this is because of the fact that as i was growing up this was quite literally the only thing I presented to people. I presented myself as a fake person and then people started to see that, but my issue lies within the fact that once people see that, or once people see you for that negative light that you once were people dont ever really stop seeing that. its like you have no chance at improving or ever becoming something else in someone‚Äôs eyes because thats the only light they will ever view you in. Once you make a mistake it seems like thats all that people will ever see you for and so i feel like i kind of have a right to live up to that expectation now maybe? is that wrong of me to feel that way? i feel like its kind of showing how weak and insecure i am. almost like in the sense of how instead of choosing to get better i feel like i just have to live up to the bleak standards that people have for me. i have always felt like this when it comes to my parents or family especially. For some important context i was adopted as a 2 year old from an extremely abusive and neglected environment. i was told that i witnessed my birth father abuse my birth mother and was subjected to that abuse myself. now i know this doesn‚Äôt really mean anything, but i have always felt like the little things like this really shaped my mind into the shit show that it is today. I cannot for the life of me understand and really develop what love is and it absolutely horrifies me every night. I sit awake and ball my eyes out because I don‚Äôt understand how i simply cannot comprehend how to love someone. its not just even romantic relationships, its family and friendships aswell. for some reason i just can‚Äôt seem to connect with anyone on that level of mutual love on respect i know i am supposed to have, but i just simply don‚Äôt. love is something your supposed to just have and not supposed to feel like you have to have it. i feel like i am supposed to love those people (ie my family) instead of just loving them. and this is how i feel with people who i even have the balls to let get close to me. which by the way if i haven‚Äôt set that up well enough yet, i am now. I really dont let people get close to me. I feel like it makes me weak and vulnerable and every-time i have tried that, i feel like i just always end up losing. i always end up losing more of myself that what i thought i signed up for and i feel like its slowly eating away at my mental health. i feel like i have to love instead of just doing so. yet when it comes to some random person i don‚Äôt even know, or someone off of the streets (ie homeless people or people who seem to have ‚Äúless‚Äù)  i feel like i need to give all the care and all of everything i can give to them to them. i feel like its kind of my duty as someone who has more to give to those who have less or aren‚Äôt able to get more and i feel like that ties back into the narcissism that i feel like ive got. i feel like an asshole and I really despise myself because i feel like thats all i have ever known to feel about myself. i am mean, i put my parents through hell as a kid and they still would come back to my screams and tantrums. they would come back to me cursing them out and giving them hell ever chance i got and we would just always end up in the same vicious cycle that i feel like i have always known since i was that 2 year old girl. i know i am doomed and my mind is broken and my views are very warped. ive got a lot of baggage and i hate myself for it, but i am hre asking for help because I don‚Äôt know what to do. i feel stuck in this cycle of carnage and i feel hopeless. i need help",mentalhealth

1697257643.0,i am nearly 18 years old and i can't empathize with people,"so, the title may sound a bit funny  but anyway. since i was a child i feel like i can't empathize enough with people and that isn't something i worry but i find it rather curious about myself.

 i haven't had much contact with other people either, so i never directly learned how to emotionally behave with people the right way like having a strong vinculum; so much so i can easily cut off (or ghost) people even if we know each other for years. 

i was raised separately from other children, my parents weren't much present in my childhood as well as most of my family (that loves calling me a weirdo ever since). i barely remember my parents unless when they were like fighting bc they fought a lot. 

mother told me to be always kind to everyone even if i don't mean it and that's what i usually do. i smile, i nod, i got a sweet voice on (i'm a female), i lie. i was also told that empathizing with others was the right thing to do, even if they were my enemies, but there is; i can't. i didn't think it was natural because people told me it wasn't but i also didn't reflect about it. it's not like i thought all day about how they felt or put myself on their place and this is the hardest to me.

i already hurt a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù (i have some difficulty w/ using the word friend w/ anyone lol) with something i said related to a trauma she has; it wasn't directly to her but somehow she felt bad about it since apparently it was related to a trauma of hers. i was called out by her partner and by pure pressure, i apologized; but deep inside i didn't want. i ignored her for a whole week after that bc she made my ugly ass apologize like why i should it? i didn't say it directly to her but anyway we are in good terms now but i still can't feel bad for that and sometimes i feel like i will probably hurt her and others again someday because i don't mind my own words.

i heard them talking about their problems but didn't feel like it was important. i don't know if i can say it's narcissistic but, it wasn't about me and it wasn't my problem so i thought it wasn't important. i was just acting like my mother told me. to hear people and be nice.

 i tell people not to empathize with me because i probably can't feel for them either. i've already wrongly disdained of other people's traumas, even when me myself was neglected and felt abandoned by my family so i dont think anyone should really care about my traumas  or problems. a lot of people still hear me and it's surprising because i directly tell them they shouldn't really care.

to me it depends a lot. i feel like i can feel bad for children and babies; but teenagers and adults i couldn't really care much for them, or what happens to them. i can't even feel guilty for not caring about others in a deeper way and by others i also include certain family members.

in fact, inside my family; most precisely my father, has some issue with not expressing empathy and guilt/remorse. i don't know if it's genetical but, sometimes i think my environment played a huge role as well.

maybe is normal not to care about  some things isn't it?  i was told to get professional help fast as i could've a personality disorder (i don't really considerate any of it) but i am just completing 17 years by this year and next year is when i am 18. to older people or anyone who can relate to me, do you have any thoughts about it? you can be mean if you want ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è",mentalhealth
1697265115.0,"I had a revelation, but at 39... So whats the point?","I'm a 39yr old divorced male. I've pretty much met all my goals I had in life. I had a son, I've achieved my dream job as a Welding Engineer shortly after some time in military intelligence (35L). But I've never been overall happy... About 3 years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive Type, which explained a lot but didn't answer all the questions of why I'm like the way I am; indifferent to anything and everything. I assume depression has it's hand in it as well because I have either lost altogether or at times, the will to do anything I used to enjoy. I was an avid guitar player and collector, they've all been collecting dust for at least 3 years now. My life consists of going to work, then coming to an empty house with my two boxers. I just end up doom scrolling on my phone until it gets late, then I take a shower then go to bed. Even on the weekends this is about as exciting as my routine gets. I have no friends circle, I don't go out besides for things like groceries. Outside of work the only communication I have with other people is online to a very select few. 

A few seemingly random event's and thoughts that came up recently forced me to look inward for my problems. I don't want to go into detail because it will distract my train of thought. But the topic of empathy came up while I was speaking to a friend online and as I just finished telling her how I can only think of two times in my life I've ever woken up in the morning feeling rested. Since we were talking about empathy, I realized there's only two times in my life that I've felt what I understand as empathy. Once involved my son being sick and another involved my senior dog... 

I think I'm a sociopath.

I don't have all the characteristics that immediately would make one think sociopathy. But I have the majority of them such as: Impulsive behavior, Trouble with responsibilities, Generally superficial relationships, Difficulty recognizing emotion, Lack of empathy for others, and emotional detachment. There's ones I don't relate to like heavy drinking or abusing drugs (I swear drugs just don't work on me, I've tried every stimulant under the sun with zero effects. It has made me wonder in the past if my dopamine receptors even work.), constant lying, deception and manipulation. I may not care how someone feels overall. But I have a sense of fairness, and I don't see that as fair.  

I just don't know where to go from here. I feel like I'm too old and too set in my ways and I highly doubt there's effective treatment. Especially therapy, I tried it for anger management in my late teens and I just couldn't take it seriously. But I've lived 39 years without being happy, at least anything beyond excitement over an event or achievement, nothing that lasted over 24 hours. I don't see a point, I just understand the problem that has no solution.

1697276625.0,Living a bad life,"Just gonna be honest from the top, here: this is gonna be a long, structureless, pointless rant. Your time would definitely be better spent on pretty much anything other than reading this post. It‚Äôll be a miracle if my shame doesn‚Äôt see me take down this post within just a few minutes of it going live, anyways.

To introduce myself: I‚Äôm a (currently) fat white guy. 27, going on 28 - and I really don‚Äôt want to live to see thirty. Not out of some fear of the future, or losing my youth‚Ä¶ none of that stuff really matters to me. I guess if I could put why I feel that way into words, it comes from a strange sort of hope. That I could maybe get just one good thing out of my life; maybe some sympathy for having died ‚Äúyoung‚Äù. Maybe to add to some sad statistic that might weigh on others‚Äô minds, and maybe change the way they treat the less fortunate. Something. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any other good I can do in this life anymore. Just too tired and bitter for anything else

Just gonna keep laying out my grievances from here. Personal woes - not even touching upon how much the world‚Äôs best me down. Everyone deals with that, of course.

For starters: I‚Äôm ugly. I won‚Äôt let anyone argue with me about that, or ask me to post face, just so they can judge for themselves. I‚Äôve always known it. I see myself in the mirror every day, after all. And, removed from my own perspective, I‚Äôve also been told by strangers (online and irl), friends, family, etc. Even managed to wrestle that admission out of my mom, some years ago. 

I don‚Äôt know how I got beat with the ugly stick so hard, since everyone else on both sides of my family at least look average‚Ä¶ but yeah, I indisputably was. Crooked and upturned nose, misshapen head, slim and ‚Äúscary‚Äù eyes, weak jaw‚Ä¶ the list goes on and on. And that‚Äôs just my face! That‚Äôs not even bringing up the rest of my disgusting body. Chronic acne starting in my teenage years that I‚Äôve never been able to fight off, even with all the medications and dermatologist tips in the world. Plenty of deep scarring from that, too. That, and from ingrown hairs and boils, cysts, etc. The skin I live in alone makes waking up unpleasant.

I‚Äôm also poor, have a wide array of chronic health issues, and I‚Äôm asexual. That last one is probably a blessing at least, because I‚Äôve never had to deal with sexual frustration. Nope‚Ä¶ just your average crippling loneliness, and the fear of what‚Äôll happen if I somehow outlive the only person who really cares about me (my mom).

I said I‚Äôm currently fat in the beginning, and yeah - I am, for now. I‚Äôve fluctuated from being skinny to fat since I hit puberty, and I even had a short phase in my teen years where I was pretty ‚Äúin shape‚Äù, all things considered. It didn‚Äôt improve my body image, but I figured it‚Äôd be worth pursuing.

It took until last year for me to work up the energy to pursue getting a GED, and even that just felt like a waste of time in the end. I‚Äôm still just gonna be working dead-end jobs forever - and with how little I‚Äôve got going, I don‚Äôt see that changing anytime soon. I‚Äôve got zero motivation to try and better myself, frankly. I don‚Äôt see how I could make this life redeemable.

To close this whole tirade out: I‚Äôll just say that I‚Äôve never really felt like I‚Äôve had any real reason(s) to live. Frankly, I feel so inhuman internally that I‚Äôm amazed to not have been deemed autistic or anything like that by any of the counselors or therapists I‚Äôve blown money on over the years. The only diagnoses that have stuck are MDD, and complete anhedonia (starting around 7 years old). 

The only treatment left that I‚Äôd say would have any potential to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me would potentially be magic mushrooms‚Ä¶ which aren‚Äôt legal in the state I live currently. I‚Äôve mentioned this before on Reddit and elsewhere online, resulting in multiple people contacting me with offers to sell them or be my psychonaut - but I‚Äôd prefer to try them in a professional medical environment. Which isn‚Äôt currently available to me at the moment, for the variety of reasons I‚Äôve laid out above (legality, financials, inherent drive, etc)

My existence has been so utterly sad to witness that it‚Äôs resulted in my mom falling out of religion. I rendered her inconsolable for several months at age 14, when after a severe mental break and prolonged stay at a mental health facility, I told her that I felt ‚Äúlife maybe just isn‚Äôt for everyone‚Äù. She came out of that experience having grappled with her faith, now profoundly atheist and spiritually detached. I felt bad about it at the time, and tried to convince her that I‚Äôm perhaps being punished for misdeeds in a prior life - but I don‚Äôt think that kind of gnostic belief could ever connect with her on any level.

I know I cause her excruciating emotional pain, and that used to depress me - but I just don‚Äôt have the bandwidth for that now, I guess.

I‚Äôm just going to cut things off here, ‚Äòcause I could genuinely keep dumping my thoughts forever. I‚Äôm just as weepy when I‚Äôm not drunk, anyways. Thanks for reading, I guess. I don‚Äôt know how anyone could help, but knowing that a stranger cared enough to read through this whole mess is kinda sad/cool",mentalhealth

For many years now, maybe about 3, I have had an imaginary girlfriend in my head. I talk to her, mostly when I'm alone. For example, when playing video games or watching movies. She has a full name and likes and dislikes, and I know exactly what she looks like. I know all her family members and when she was born, stuff like that. She's kind and let's me be open to her. She's kind of like the 'perfect' partner I guess. What's even more odd, though, is that she doesn't refer to me by name. Whenever I'm talking to her I pretend I'm another character I made up. I'm 17 now (almost 18 in a few months) and I feel like I'm getting too old for this. I've always had imaginary friends (sort of) since I was in elementary school but they were mostly at night, before bed. I talk to her every single day. Not out loud, just in my head. 

Both of these imaginary people started out as characters in a book I was writing back in middle school. I always thought I was just being creative and brainstorming but I haven't wrote in over a year and have no interest in it but she's still here. 

I have a few friends and I enjoy being with them, but I don't have many. When I'm with them I rarely think about her, if at all. I'm also an only child, if that helps.

1697253676.0,Feeling No Longer Capable of Living a Normal Life,"I feel I need someone else's perspective on something bothering me. The person I usually talk to is currently on maternity leave and I literally have no one to talk to. Sometimes sharing stuff online backfires at you but I'm trying my luck here. 

I'm 42. I grew up a positive, happy girl with lots of ambitions and dreams, though lonely in my surroundings, being almost an only child. My one wish was to grow up fast so that I can have a companion in life. Never felt my childhood was similar to other people my age, because I was surrounded by people way older who fulfilled a traditional social castes. At a very young age, I watched my siblings get married, have kids, deal with adult problems. I figured that was automatically what I was also supposed to do--grow up, fall in love, have kids, and deal with a conventional life. 

During my adult life, I couldn't settle for what people around me wanted me to settle for. Because I come from a very small closely-knitted community, people surrounding you usually set you up and everyone becomes involved in everyone else's business. As much as I felt happy being in my surrounding and around others, I never felt understood well. I was usually a supporter--the babysitter, wonderful aunt, obedient family member--I did what others wanted to me do; I went along with everyone's expectations just to avoid conflicts, but deep down I wasn't sharing or communicating on an equal level. I felt it was a mistake to conform, because that meant I was adapting; and not really resonating with who I really am. At the same time, I didn't have the social or life skills to pursue my own thing. I just stayed within my environment, refused to conform or settle, and continued dreaming of a day when I magically stumble on what I regarded my perfect life would be. 

So much has happened in my 20s and 30s. The biggest turning point was getting tangled up with bad friends, obsessive, narcissistic personalties, and abusive/controlling ones. Drama, stress, and tension made me want to avoid conflict more than anything and that propelled me to get back into my own shell to stay safe. Due to being psychologically/emotionally abused as a child by a relative outside my immediate comfort zone, I lost my ability to trust people. I grew up into an adult who constantly felt targeted due to the horrible experiences I've been through (obsession, stalking, plotting to ruin my life). I decided to remove myself completely from the spotlight and just live quietly. I stopped socializing, I stopped mingling, I stopped being spontaneous, I stopped doing anything that puts me out there in the spotlight and at risk of being a target. That made me feel safe. 

Fast forward to my 40s now and life is so difficult. I'm still in my immediate surrounding being a caregiver. I wouldn't change it for anything. I genuinely accepted that being a wife, mother, or someone's partner in life is simply just not in it in the cards for me. I made peace with that. 

I'm busy doing my own thing--hobbies, keeping my space organized, gardening, and settling into middle age. There are days when it's immensely difficult due to physical pain that suddenly took over my life. I suffer from horrible neck pain that is making my life miserable. There are days where I can't sleep, sit, or do simple things. I can't read or study. I can't sit on a desk and try to learn something new. It's an on and off switch. One day I'm fine; the next I'm feeling crippled. 

I got used to picking myself up. I no longer expect anyone to understand my pain or tailor to my depression. Sure, sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and give myself a pathetic 2 or 3 minutes of crying with the woes of ""why me, why couldn't I have someone to just help ease this pain--just say something nice to me or make me feel safe"", but then I just flip, get up, tell myself to suck it up and move on. I'm good at that now. 

Since I graduated from grad school, I've been toying with the idea of getting a pet. It's like having a baby fever or something. I've had cats and close connections to cats my whole life except for the past decade or so, when I discovered I have mild allergies. I still toyed with the idea of having a companion. I remember how nice it felt waking up in the morning when you feel your worst and thinking, ""I can't afford to be depressed, my cat needs me"" or ""I'm feeling like shit right now, I need to be around my cat and just forget everything"". I miss that feeling so much. 

A few years back, I shared that urge of getting a pet with a close friend who wasn't supportive of the idea at all. I felt hurt, because whenever I shared something I was doing--still studying despite being in my late 30s at the time or wanting to get a cat, it was always met with some kind of unsupportive remarks. The biggest slap to me was, ""cats are bad luck, why are you getting one?"". She went into details about why they're bad luck and till this day, I can't forget that conversation. I'm not superstitious and on a logical sphere, I know it's crap, but it affected me so much, I began synthesizing stuff happening based on her theory, ""oh no, a negative incident did happen when I was in contact with a cat that one time--could what she's saying be true?"". 

It sounds so bizarre and illogical, but I think it just resonated with a pre-existing fear of always having things ruined for me. It intensified that hesitation, more fears and doubts in me. It's ironic, because she struggled so much to be a parent. She must know how it feels to want that maternal feeling. I already expressed to me, having a cat is like having a baby. My motivation is to fill a void inside of me that feels so cold and emotionless. I feel dead inside. 

While I pushed aside her words and moved on with my life, I still find myself incapable of making simple decisions like this. It made me self-reflect and realize I'm no longer capable of making simple decisions normal people make everyday. 

I found the cutest kitten the other day and contacted the person. It was so difficult to push myself to do it. I figured--that's it. Just do it. You have the experience, you have the means. It's a chance to bond with a best-friend, feel human, develop healthy emotional connections, etc. 

I still can't do it. 

""You barely have energy to lift yourself up on sick days, how will you be able to handle a cat"", ""what if you decide this and then realize you can't have a pet"", ""what if it gets too much; you're not used to having a creature (human or animal) around you 24/7""

I would never put my own selfish gains before an animal's and I would rather get hurt than hurting someone else, so I just decided not to get a pet anymore, but deep down I'm so hurt. 

I'm probably going to be fine accepting this as a new reality similar to letting go of a dozen other wants in life. I just can't help feeling like crap. I feel like the safest thing for me is to continue living like this, alone and deprived from any healthy emotional connection with either human or pet. It made me realize how difficult life has become for me. I have gotten so used to avoiding conflict to feel safe, I'm scared of making decisions in life. And due to more complications like health hiccups, I feel more incapable now. It's awful. 

I guess that brings a level of feeling some kind injustice. Like the best part of my life were robbed from me, either by others or my own self-sabotage. I'm probably over amplifying things right now, because I feel very emotionally vulnerable right now. I'm probably going to reread this later and roll my eyes. I just felt like I needed to give myself the chance to pour it all out and tell myself it's okay to feel like shit and sound like shit for a little while.

1697239701.0,I‚Äôm Spiraling,"I started college a month ago and was really excited for a chance to make new friends. I always feel like I messed up my chance at making friends in elementary school by how I behaved. However, I feel like everyone but me has made at least one friend. 

I became an RA (resident advisor) before school and moved in three weeks before everyone else. I get on okay with the other RA's but none of them are in my course and I don't hang out with them outside the job. The other residence never invite me to anything, despite me seeing them hanging out on the floor. Whenever I pass by, or say hello, they go quiet and I overhear them say 'it's the RA'. The only person who I would consider an acquaintance (one of my residents) will strike up a convo with me in passing but other then that we never talk. I attended the start of term events for making friends and got peoples socials, however that doesn't have seemed to done anything to help. 

I know that I might not be the most interesting person, especially at an art school, but I feel like this has been happening all my life. On any sports team I only make acquaintances with my teammates and at any job/school I've been to I've really only ever had two friends. One of them is currently in a different province and the other is swamped in schoolwork so I never see either of them, and it's hard to find time to talk to either of them.

It's starting to really get to me and I can feel myself spiralling (this is just a part of it). idk what to do.

1697256405.0,Do i have bpd?,"

I just want to tell you why i think i may have bpd and what got me into it, so if you can help, tell me if this could be bpd or not. i don't have access to therapy so i can't get professionals thoughts  on it , i know without professional it is practically improssible to know for sure  and there is not much you can say but i just want to know if   this could be it (i should probably  add that i am 17 and i know at this age you cant really get diagnosed with it but still...).

 I have always described myself as an ustable person and one time i was watching a movie and in that movie they described this one girl as an ustable, and as someone who changes her mind often and as someone who doesn't really know exactly what they want and something like that and they said that she had bpd, so this description felt a little too personal so i decided to get more information about bpd, when i read the symptoms, some of them made so much sense , some of them not so much. The ones that really made me think about it was the chronic feelings of emptiness and  unstable self- image or sense of self. I have always felt empty and i feel like no matter what i do, nothing will fill this void inside me, it just follows me.also i have never really understood who i was, in the past it was hard to even say what did i do in my free time and what my hobbies were, it got better, now i think i know what i enjoy doing in my free time but still i have this weird feeling like i don't know who i am and i cant even describe this feeling very well. I  have never attempted suicide, i used to self harm but i never intended to harm myself seriously, it was just the way of dealing with everything.it was the way of grounding myself and the way to fight my emptiness.I know that dissociation is one of the symptoms of bpd but my dissociation is so bad that i think i may have separate disorder like DPDR i have the feeling like i have had this my whole life and its just constant there is no time where it goes away. These are the thing that i strongly relate but there are also things that i dont relate or don't know if i relate or not. For example fear of abandonment, in my childhood i was not abandoned, i don't really understand if i have this or not. I feel like people with fear of abandonment are kinda clingy but i am totally opposite, if i have the feeling that someone doesn't want to spent time with me and they are about to abandon me ( i cant really trust my feeling about these things cause even slightest things makes me think that they want to abandon me) i get really distant, i try to totally cut them out of my life. Communication is real problem for me, especially when it comes to my feelings. I am not sure about the emotional instabiliy either, i feel like under my every feeling and emotion  is just again emptiness. I dont know about splitting either, it is really hard for me to connect with poeple and to be comfortable with them so i can't really express my emotions that clearly towards them, i have this one close friend, and sometimes i feel really amazed by them and i am glad that i am friends with them and other times i feel  idk how to say but like almost disgusted by them. I dont know if it is bpd thing or just regular. People with bpd are really expressive and explosive and things like that and i am nothing like that, that makes me think that i dont have it.I never express anger, a lot of people have said that they have never seen me angry or even upset. i wouldn't say that i have a problem with controlling my emotions.

1697246065.0,Caught feelings for a girl I barely knew and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her,There‚Äôs this girl at school who I had liked since I saw her for the first time. Well about two weeks pass since I first see her and I decide to approach her and ask for her socials to get to know each other and whatnot. So I go up to her during lunch and start a conversation with her and things go surprisingly well to the point I thought it was a dream. I‚Äôm not even kidding when I say that everything felt so natural as if it was meant to happen. Well things go well I get her socials and I send her a message so we start talking over text as well. This goes on for a couple days and one day after school we talk about going over to her place to hang out for a while and maybe smoke a bit if that‚Äôs the mood. Also yes I know smoking isn‚Äôt good for me especially when I‚Äôm still in high school but I only do it once every couple months and at most a couple times every like two months. Anyway we get out of school and head over to hers where we hang out for a bit before things get more inappropriate to put it in a sfw way. Things happen it was good and after we walk over to a park near where she lives for around half an hour before I head home. Everything felt so surreal as if I would wake up at any moment and realize it had all been a dream. I laid down on a bench and had my head on her lap while she played with my hair. We talked and laughed and she would occasionally go down to kiss me. It really was the happiest I had been for a while even after that day we continued to talk and hang out in and out of school. Well until about a week and a half after that day that she suddenly changed and didn‚Äôt want to talk to me. She didn‚Äôt talk to me for most of the day but near the end of the day she apologized for it and said she was just having some problems and was in a bad mood. Whatever right? I say it‚Äôs ok and we start talking again like usual. The next day I decide to skip 6th and 7th period and she says she wants to go with me so we sneak out of school and we talk while we‚Äôre out walking to a park near our school. It was strange though that she kept bringing up why I liked her and why I was interested in her but I told her truthfully what I thought. She seemed happy but like she felt bad about it too. Around 3 or 4 hours pass and out of nowhere she says she wants to leave. I ask what‚Äôs up and she says she isn‚Äôt good and just wants to leave me but doesn‚Äôt want to hurt me. I tell her to leave if she wants and she walks away while I just sit there and watch. In the moment my first reaction was to laugh for some reason but I went completely silent after. It didn‚Äôt really hit me until the next day that I woke up feeling like complete shit knowing I just lost the first girl I was ever so interested in.  I woke up to no messages from her and honestly it felt awful. It‚Äôs been I think about a month by now and I really don‚Äôt feel any better about it.

1697263674.0,I do not exist.,"Legally speaking, I do exist. I have physical proof of my existence, but it‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs just chicken scratch on a piece of paper.

When you do something wrong or different, people usually look. For example, if you were to walk into the wrong classroom, the students in the class would glance at you, nothing your unprompted presence, If I, however, were to walk into the wrong classroom, nobody would bat an eye. If my existence isn‚Äôt acknowledged by others, should I even acknowledge it myself? Perhaps I am just a fragment of somebody‚Äôs thoughts, an imaginary friend.

This invisibility is nothing new. I‚Äôve been avoided my entire life. During my elementary years, the only people who talked to me were my teachers and my single friend. And although I claim that I‚Äôm not actually here, this single friend was the only person that saw me. Maybe I was her imaginary friend.

This feeling of inclusion was blinding. This friend of mine was incredibly toxic. And when I say that, I don‚Äôt mean your average ‚Äúshe spread rumors about me‚Äù or ‚Äúshe forced me to do drugs.‚Äù This girl, this *monster*, that I befriended was so much worse. As much as I‚Äôd love to go into the details, this post would be more like an autobiography, proving her unhealthy prominence in my life. I‚Äôd like to blame her for my severe alienation, but it must be deeper than that. One thing is for sure: she definitely did not help the case.

I know I‚Äôve always been a little different, for better or for worse, but I‚Äôve always been told that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all special in our own ways,‚Äù so I brushed it off. Unfortunately for me, what makes me unique isn‚Äòt special at all. Rather, it‚Äôs more of a curse, being so ‚Äúunique‚Äù that complete and utter loneliness follow me no matter where I go. Despite saying that I‚Äôve been purposefully ignored for as long as I can remember, I did get more attention when I was younger. However, I think the loneliness built on top of each other, eventually leading me to isolate myself without even realizing it. But I don‚Äôt want to be isolated. I want to be seen, to be heard, to be *acknowledged*.

People know me, yes, but they don‚Äôt know me as a *person*. I haven‚Äôt met a single person who has even come up with the idea that I have emotions. Whenever I try to display emotions to people I thought I could trust, I‚Äôm met with people‚Äôs faces cringing, and an ‚Äúokay..?‚Äù Or they just turn my emotions into their own, usually by claiming their situation is worse. I‚Äôm a huge people-pleaser, usually at my own expense, and therefore when people do see me, they see me as an asset. Nobody knows my favorite color, my hobbies, my interests, etc. And it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt try to share. Whenever I try to tell people about about myself, I either get bored looks or interrupted  by people saying that I shouldn‚Äôt always talk about myself, when in reality, I‚Äôve barely made it a word past ‚ÄúI.‚Äù (Unfortunately this post does not help support this.) Due to this, I‚Äôve stopped talking about myself altogether. People love to talk about themselves, no matter how boring they are. The only things I say are in response to somebody‚Äôs selfishness, such as useless advice, useless commentary, or anything useless for a useless story that they say because fhey‚Äôve run out of material. Unfortunately their lack of words doesn‚Äôt offer me any chance to speak about myself.

There‚Äôs nothing more I want than attention. (This paragraph might be a little controversial or triggering so this is my content warning.) Everybody wants attention, as it‚Äôs part of human nature, but when somebody is extremely deprived of it, they become desperate. I would do anything for acknowledgement. I‚Äôd allow myself to get bullied, I‚Äôd be fine with getting a chronic illness, I‚Äôd purposely allow myself to get injured, I‚Äôd even kill somebody if it really meant that people would pay attention to me. (I probably won‚Äôt kill anybody, I think that it‚Äôs just a reoccurring intrusive thought I get.) Sometimes I wish something terrible would happen to me, just so somebody would look my way and maybe even say ‚Äúsorry,‚Äù whether it be for my condition or how ignorant they are.

I‚Äôd like to add that it‚Äôs not depersonalization or dissociation. I see through my eyes and my eyes only. There is no feeling of being in a dream-like state, or viewing myself through third person.

And to add evidence to my claim of invisibility, here are some situations that have happened to me, just in the past week:

\- I was sitting at a table with three other people. Two people were going to go somewhere together when the third person, still sitting down, claimed they didn‚Äôt want to be alone. But they weren‚Äôt alone. I was there. Not a single person at that table even glanced in my direction. Nobody said my name. Naturally, as normal humans do, they all went together and left me by myself, as per usual.

\- In class, the teacher asked a question, expecting students to raise their hands in order to answer. However, nobody did, so I raised mine, as I knew the answer. I‚Äôve never risen my hand in this class before as most people usually have their hands raised before mine and I don‚Äôt stand a chance against them. Anyways, the teacher looked around the room, disappointed, and decided to just on somebody random, disregarding my arm firmly raised towards the ceiling.

\- In class, we had to ‚Äútalk with our shoulder partner‚Äù regarding the lecture, and I spoke, actively trying to participate in class, but with no response from my counterpart. Not even eye contact. In fact, I couldn‚Äôt even see their eyes. I was looking at them, trying to converse, but they were faced forward, their hair seeming to cover nothing but the eye.

\- I went to get lunch from the cafeteria and was confused about one of the foods they were serving. Naturally, I asked approached to ask a question. At my school, the lunch servers usually to comvey to others what they‚Äôre serving, as there are several meals offered per day. I walked up to this guy advertising his section via voice and began to speak. At first, I thought he didn‚Äôt hear me, so I spoke louder. And louder. He never looked at me. If he had saw me, he would have at least tried to serve me food like he was to other kids.

I was only expecting this post to be a paragraph or two long, but when given a voice, I try my best to milk it of every opportunity. I have so many words locked up inside of me without a key. And if anybody read this whole thing, kudos to you! By the way, if anybody has anything I should research to find out more about this‚Äîpossible mental disorders, causes, treatments, communities, etc.‚Äî please let me know because even though I find comfort in it, I hate this alienated way of living so very badly.

She's withholding my Lexapro until I can go and do a full panel fasting lab where they look at my organ function. I'm down to one pill. Idk when is it gonna be the right moment to take it, because I can't remember how long it takes to get lab results. They said I don't get the refills until the results are in. I have something important going on next week and I don't know if I'll be stable. Emotional dysregulation for me feels awful. I'm afraid one day I'll make me snap at someone or say something hurtful.

I‚Äôll ask him to play and if he says ‚Äúnot right now‚Äù I‚Äôll bug him later and then get mad if he says no but then he doesn‚Äôt wanna play BECAUSE I freak out so I have to not freak out even though I am freaking out and if I say anything about it it becomes worse and I just spiral into doom. 

I will get really fucking mad about whatever and want to punch or throw or break something or hurt myself and when he tries to tell me to calm down and stop I lose it and walk off but I don‚Äôt wanna walk off and I feel like I have absolutely no fucking control over anything.

He says things like I just tell myself I can‚Äôt do it and it‚Äôs easy to blame other things/people then myself but it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm blaming things it feels like there‚Äôs something WRONG with me. 

I don‚Äôt make enough money to go to therapy, and realistically, when I have, it only helps for a little bit and then it feels like I‚Äôm just talking about the same shit all the time, and my meds have been the same for like a decade and my doctor is hesitant to change it and so am I really.

Some moments I am fully thankful and happy and the most excited to have him care as much as he does and some moments I hate the whole world and don‚Äôt give a shit about anything and then immediately spiral into self hate and unaliving thoughts and how terrible I am and I just feel lost and stuck and confused and I don‚Äôt know what to do or if I‚Äôm okay or what.",mentalhealth

1697246382.0,Effects of an overbearing mother,"So my mother has always been controlling. She says she has bad anxiety and stuff, shes prescribed medication but doesn‚Äôt really take it. I‚Äôve had issues with her for years but I am now going to be 20 soon and am in college. I‚Äôve tried expressing my feelings and how it affects me before but any sort of criticism like that she takes as an attack and gets emotionally abusive, as she tends to do. Shes been like that as long as I can remember and I think it has really affected me in terms of development.

 Past a certain point I became ruled by anxiety too. I have a hard time saying no to people, I have a hard time connecting and communicating with people, especially women, low self esteem and so on and so forth. These have been problems I‚Äôve struggled with for years but after my move to college I thought it would gradually improve especially now that I‚Äôve started to prioritize living a healthy lifestyle. However it has been 8 weeks and I still have no friends here. I feel awkward eating alone, I don‚Äôt go to parties or do much in my free time because I have nobody to do it with. It‚Äôs so lonely and I‚Äôve felt lonely for so long. 

My mom texts me at least 10 times a day, and when I recently asked nicely if we could make a goal to text me less, she said ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù, and starts using everything she does for me against me. I‚Äôm not too worried about how to erase her influence over my life. When I‚Äôm ready, which will be soon, I can lay it all out, it will probably be rough and I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt see my family for a while after that but it‚Äôs nothing ive never dealt with before with her.

My main concern is whether or not I can change and live a life I‚Äôm happy with. I want to have a social life so bad, I‚Äôve wanted to date for a long time but have never even kissed a girl yet. I‚Äôve been in an out of talk therapy and idk if I‚Äôve just been seeing shitty therapists or what because I never find any solutions or revelations, in fact that only ever happens when I‚Äôm on my own and thinking a lot. I‚Äôve been trying to put myself in uncomfortable situations and develop hobbies and healthy habits like meditation, working out, and journaling, but any improvement I see is marginal at best for all the time and energy I spend thinking about improvement. I guess I‚Äôm looking for some advice or something, or maybe some confirmation that I can change and live a happy life. And I just kind of needed to get this out there.

1697228994.0,Personal Essay,"The Importance of Men‚Äôs Mental Health  
The issue of men‚Äôs mental health is starting to be recognized more and more but there is still the stigma surrounding it. The stigma of being a man‚Äôs man and having to keep inner thoughts to yourself is harmful to each other. The changes experienced in a young man‚Äôs life when trying to find out the kind of man they want to be. The issue of loneliness significantly impacts the mental health of young men, making their daily lives and academic pursuits difficult. My essay will try to shed light on the topics and dispel the stigma associated with male vulnerability.   
Men often face challenges and hurdles when it comes to their own mental health. In college the societal expectations and traditional gender roles can create pressure for any man. The need for men to be seen as strong, resilient, and in control of their emotions. With the task that seems so easy of just reaching out for help to men can be seen as a sign of weakness or vulnerability. This can be discoursing men from reaching out for support. Studies suggest that traditional norms of masculinity make it difficult for men to acknowledge their mental health struggles or just being open with their emotions. A study published in 2019 from the Journal of American College Health found male college students often look over the mental health programs and services on their campus due to the stigma surrounding the topic. The fear of societal judgement is keeping young men from the tools to help them. In the same journal article, they talk about how the competitive academic environment and high expectations in college can add to stress and anxiety for male students, leading to a more likelihood of mental health challenge‚Äôs during their time in college.  
College can be drastically different then home life, moving from something you are so comfortable with and having it all change. The issue of loneliness is a significant concern for men‚Äôs mental health in the context of college. Societal norms of masculinity have an emphasize on independence and self-sufficiency, with that has the outcome of men to hesitate in making social connections and communicate feelings of loneliness. A study published in 2017 by the Journal of Adolescent Research in the relations of traditional masculine norms and the increase of a feeling of loneliness among college aged men. The study yielded that traditional masculine ideals was connected to higher levels of loneliness and decreased willingness to seek out help. Aside from scholastic responsibilities, adjusting to a new social environment and other demands of college life can also make loneliness more common. Developing focused interventions that encourage social interaction, emotional expression, and a sense of community requires a recognition of and a focus on the issue of isolation in men's mental health.  
To promote an environment of open communication, understanding, and support, it is important to lessen the stigma that surrounds men's mental health. The most significant components in fixing this issue are education and awareness efforts. Stereotypes and preconceptions about mental health can be debunked by distributing realistic information about it, including the tools that are accessible and the typical problems that men face. Targeted educational initiatives have demonstrated promise in lowering stigma and raising mental health literacy, in a 2016 study published in the Journal of Mental Health. Additionally, it is beneficial to challenge society conventions and attitudes and encourage open talks about mental health in both official and informal contexts. An article published in the American Journal of Men's Health (2018) highlights the importance that is to mainstream conversations about mental health among men, emphasizing that open talks can encourage getting help and eventually reduce stigma. In the end, we can successfully fight the stigma attached to men's mental health by creating an atmosphere where men feel at ease to discuss their issues and seeking help.  
In this regard, there is no denying that awareness and comprehension of men's mental health have grown, but progress continues to be hindered by persisting stigmas. The general notion of being a ""man's man,"" in addition to the pressure to keep emotional thoughts private, can be detrimental to men's mental health. Young men struggle to navigate societal expectations and define their identities, particularly in the early years of college. Men experience more difficulties because of loneliness, which affects both their everyday life and academic endeavors. It is necessary to address the stigma attached to male vulnerability, and this essay is intended to debunk certain myths about it. College can be an emotionally draining place, and it's important to comprehend how gender norms affect men's mental health. We can strive to remove the stigma associated with men's mental health by encouraging candid conversations, learning, and the development of a supportive and understanding society. It is critical to foster an atmosphere in which men feel at ease talking about their mental health, getting support, and eventually overcoming social norms.

1697254064.0,I feel lonely,"I wanted to preface this with explaining my background for context. I am 20 years old, I really enjoy what I am studying, I have straight A's, good relationships with professors, and have interned at some cool places (at least I think they are cool). I also used to play college sports, I was really good in high school but once I came to the D1 level I burned out and lost my love for the game. I still try to stay fit going on daily runs/lifting when I can. It is safe to say I am a fairly ambitious person, and thankfully in good health so I live a generally good life.  
However, I feel very lonely sometimes. I am grateful to have some good former teammates and guys in my life, but in general I feel like theres only so much you can open up to another guy. I want to be able to talk to someone about the more emotional parts of my life, and some of the inner conflict I face. I also just want to be able to hug someone sometimes, I feel very touch deprived in general.  
I am not the person that really likes going out, I try to force myself to go out to be sociable but it is just not what makes me happy. I am also a bit shy/awkward so I am not really smooth at talking to people at bars or parties.  
A lot of my friends tell me to I should start talking to girls and reaching out to them. I keep telling myself I should but I am slightly introverted and need time to recharge my social battery (especially with my busy schedule and the field I am in requiring me to constantly interact with people). I just chalk off not actively chasing as being ""busy"" and keep procrastinating doing it. Part of it, is that it feels unnatural to me.

1697232357.0,I feel hopeless in life right now and I feel like I need to talk about it,"I'm sorry if this isn't the correct subreddit for something like this. I will also warn you that this will be very long, I have years of pent-up feelings and emotions that I have never been able to talk about and I'm gonna try to see if I can let it out through Reddit. I will also warn you that this is gonna be a pity party, and I'll try not to sulk as much as possible but it's inevitable that I do in a post like this.

Let's start with why I have to do this in a Reddit post. I have no friends (see, pity party). I haven't had friends since high school (I'm a sophomore in college). And even then they weren't really friends- I had people I talked to in school but I never has anybody that I would do things with outside of school. Fast forward to today and I don't even have people I talk to on campus. I'm a transfer student so I'm new to this campus but it's been a couple months now and most people would have at least made some sort of a friend. People always say that college is where you meet so many amazing people but I just haven't. I don't know how to talk to people and when I do it's always awkward. Sure, I'll occasionally answer a question from a dude in my Python class (I'm a computer science major, really shocking right?) and I'll work on group projects obviously but I don't have friends. I don't know how to make friends. I am incredibly lonely. And yeah, the fact that I'm unloading all this in a Reddit post of all places probably made that obvious. But it really is bad. I'm 19, only ever had a couple of real friends in my life that all drifted apart. It's incredibly pathetic and I hate myself for it. I don't think I'm that unlikable. I mean I know I'm weird but I really don't think I'm that weird. I just want to have SOMEONE I can do things with but I don't know how to do that. My days are the same everyday. I wake up, drive to campus (I live at home with my family, which I know isn't doing me any favors in the making friends department), go to class, go home, do homework, play video games, go to sleep. Rinse and repeat. Every single day. I'm just so lonely. 

I absolutely hate my body and everything about me. I know that's not an uncommon opinion and I'm not exactly revolutionizing the idea of mental health problems by saying I hate the way I look, but it's clich√© for a reason. Everything about me sucks. I'm ugly, overweight, I have insane gynecomastia that I can't afford to remove that has killed my confidence since I was 13, I have a pathetically small *you know*, and I'll probably be bald by the time I'm 25. I am everything that women find undesirable all combined into one man. I'm just so depressed from it. I've tried dozens of times to lose weight to at least *try* and improve myself, but I fail nearly everytime. I just have an intense appetite that I can't ever seem to satisfy and I means I just eat like crazy. It also makes deficits really hard to stick to. My most successful weight loss experience was losing 40 pounds actually (I went from 220 lbs to 180 lbs) but I gained nearly all of it back so I'm back to square one. I know it's not supposed to be easy but I wish I was strong enough to do it.

I also don't mean to sound like I'm resentful towards women. Believe me, I'm not. I promise you I'm not an incel. I'm not mad at women for any of my problems (and maybe I didn't come off that way and I'm just rambling but anyway). I just really want a girlfriend. Falling in love and starting a family is practically my only goal in life but that's not gonna happen if I can't get my act together and fix myself. Granted, a lot of the things wrong with me aren't really fixable but I can at least try to make up in other areas. I just wish I was better, you know? I wish I was good enough to get a girlfriend but I'm just not and I probably never will be. I can't seem to have the discipline to lose weight. And my gynecomastia will probably never get removed because I need to lose weight to deal with it. And there's nothing I can do to fix my *you know what* so I'll always have to compensate in that regard but i just hoped that I could make up for my shortcomings. I just don't feel like a man. I'm pathetic. I'm a man with an embarrassingly high-pitched voice, literal boobs, and a below average manhood. I'm not a man and I never will be. I just hate the idea that any girl I'm lucky enough to get close to would have to compensate with a bunch of things wrong with me. It sucks too because I feel like I would be a good boyfriend? (This is where the incel energy comes in lol). Like I said earlier, I don't think I'm a bad person. I wanna fall in love and give my girlfriend the world and I would do anything for her. But that's obviously not true because I can't even lose weight for the idea of a girlfriend haha. It's just that overall, I'm so incredibly below average and instead making an attempt to improve myself I just sit around and sulk.

My family situation also just makes me scared. My mom has early-onset alzheimer's and it's getting worse by the day. I think I'm still in denial about a lot of it (even though she's been diagnosed for over a year). My dad is an alcoholic. Granted he's not as bad as he once was but he still indulges on the weekends sometimes. And with him having to constantly grapple with my mom's condition it's like I can truly blame him. I'm just so scared for the future. Both my parents have chronic diseases and I have no one to talk about it with. I just have to navigate through this by myself and it's so exhausting.

Now that I get to this point in the post I'm realizing that a lot of the smaller stuff I was gonna talk about that would have made the post incredibly long are probably not worth writing here.

1697239524.0,Loneliness is hitting hard..,So I've dealt with anxiety for years now but I haven't had it hit this hard to the point of every day being a struggle since I was 18 back in 2017 but ever since last week I've been suffering with such a terrible loneliness feeling that has brought me a great deal of anxiety on top of it.. and It seems it's ever since this American girl I'm close with told me about the places she's been in America and how nice it all was and it really kinda hurt me for some reason that I couldn't be there with her  and go to all these nice places with her and its really made me hate being stuck in the UK with only one real friend and nobody to love and idk I think I might have accidently fallen for this American girl cause I always feel sad when she's not around and desperately feel like I want her with me.. and we talk all the time and have been affectionate with each other even though we're not officially together.. but I think I made a mistake in doing that because it's recently become something I'm getting anxious and feeling awful about because I want her with me so badly and I want to go to these places so badly but I just have so much I need to work out in therapy still including a fear of planes because I fear feeling trapped.. it all just sucks and every day feels hard and I don't want to do anything cause I feel so sick with anxiety and I just don't get why this feeling has come back so intensely out of nowhere..  i have somewhat recently started some new medication (I'm about 2 weeks into it) but Is it possible that would make me feel worse this far in? Idk.. its Citalopram 10mg so its not even a big dose and I was gonna get a higher dose because I felt it wasn't doing much for me but idk.. I'm just hating everything right now and really struggling.. I've already been feelin scared about what I'm gonna do with my life cause I just have some lame part time convenience store job and now I'm having to struggle with intense loneliness and anxiety on top of that.. sorry for this not well written rant I just needed to kinda vent even if nobody cares..,mentalhealth
1697238824.0,Wondering if anyone can relate to this?,"Question: does anyone else start cleaning and then find it hard to stop once you get a rhythm going? üòÑ

I came home from my PHP (Partial Hospitalization Program) today after spending 6 hours basically doing...not much at all (we had Art Therapy which means I got MESSY with paints like a toddler and it was a BLAST!!!!) and I realized my sons' room was a holy MESS! The 3 boys (21, 19, and 13) share a large open room and are complete slobs...as teenage boys tend to be. üòÇ So, I started by cleaning out by the radiator and finally fixing the wooden top that had fallen inside the cabinet (it just sits on top), getting all the garbage and clothes out from behind it. 

TW:insects mentioned

>! The roaches were all hiding inside the radiator where it is warm, so I had my Raid ready and blasted those little buggers to he** where they belong. !<

I moved the mattresses, boxsprings and got all the garbage out. I don't have a vacuum at the moment (one has been ordered and we will get it VERY soon tho!) but I did broom sweep the carpet, which wasn't all that difficult. I then noticed the mess behind the boys' dresser (and more of the above in the spoiler) so I cleaned that all out too! I swear, I went to shower and when I came back out to the living room afterwards, it was like being in a new apartment!!! It looks fantastic and I'm so proud of my two boys who helped me so much! My daughter (16) and other son (19) are at work, so it's just the 3 of us here. I ordered Subway and now I'm relaxing ... Finally. I'm exhausted but overjoyed at how the apartment looks. My eldest (24) is coming home to visit (he lives in Rochester NY) and I can't wait to finish the little nook room we have and allow him to come home to a CLEAN apartment for once. My Depression has been so bad lately but I kicked it's butt today and got stuff done! I just wanted to share something positive that happened!

1697236725.0,Is it ok to take a mental break?,"Hi new member!
I‚Äôm sure just from reading other posts everything that is happening has become overwhelming from a mental health perspective. 
Maybe it‚Äôs a rhetorical question maybe it‚Äôs not. But is it ok to just ‚Äúseparate‚Äù yourself from the news to think of other things that make you happy? 
I‚Äôm a Jewish American. I‚Äôm like so many others horrified by this week. But the guilt and the‚Ä¶uselessness feeling I guess? over not being able to do anything and feeling safe so far away from everything and watching the events unfold has started to really strain my already strained mental health. 
Am I ok to feel ok about just turning it all off and focusing on fun aspects of my life (in my instance researching and betting (albeit very small) on football). Every time I read an article on football strategy d I keep having this nagging feeling that I‚Äôm not supposed to enjoy ‚Äútrivial‚Äù things like sports at this time and I‚Äôm supposed to just feel guilty and upset about Israel (not to mention Ukraine etc etc). I keep putting myself in the place of an israeli right now and feeling horrible for being an American, not because of any political or whatever, but because I‚Äôm at least in theory very safe and far away. 
Do others feel this way? How do others cope with these feelings?

1697249927.0,Something That Helped Me,"Hello. So I just wanna preface this by saying this isn't for everyone, and that I kinda stumbled upon this by accident. I was doing research for a book I'm writing and I got into this hobby that just changed things for me. And yeah it's just a hobby but this hobby like, immediately improved my mental health in the day-to-day. I was already on a healing journey and made progress, I feel like this just kinda sped me over the last bits I needed.

I hope this works for you too.

But the hobby is called Speculative Evolution. Basically it's the hobby of creating a conceptual alien planet with atmosphere, host star(s), moons. Maybe even other planetary bodies. And then you research these environmental conditions and how they may result in the emergence of life on that planet, and how that life may evolve over the planet's natural history.

It sounds weird but it's a lot of fun, because it's deep knowledge, it's creative, scientific, mathematic, but the sheer implications of everything in it just helped me feel good in a very existential way.

As I was going through my specevo project I kept learning about how life formed on earth, and the pressures and issues faced by life in order to evolve, and just the genius learning and adaptability of our genes. It was like magic to me and I couldn't believe it. I told my fianc√® my main take away was because life itself isn't conscious, then that means the wild forces of nature form their own equilibrium. And the things in nature change in order to force this equilibrium. If over billions of years, somehow I have managed to be here and exist, then that to me means that I am, in some way, essential to life.

And the thing about that is, if I am, everyone is. The potential of our existence was locked in the cosmic particles of stars that exploded to make our world. And through billions of years of climactic chaos, primordial change, genetic mutation/adaptation, plagues, mass exitinction - somehow life determined that I - *we* - were essential to the advancement of *life.*

It just made me happy. I felt, feel, *so* incredibly connected to the world and I feel like my place in it, though small and tiny, is not insignificant. I feel good about the world, and I have a renewed appreciation for the flora and fauna of the world. It's also reconnected me to my art as I draw and paint the creatures and plants I make. It's fun and it's gifted me this incredible stance on existence. Of course I still have bad days but since getting involved in speculative evolution, life has just been better.

If anyone wants to give it a go, here's some links to the resources I use(d).

1697228186.0,"My friend was put on Keppra and her behavior has since become increasingly worrisome. How does she get help today? Please read below, TIA","My friend (28f) was put on Keppra at the end of June after having her third seizure in a year. Since then, she claims to have been feeling aggressive and within the past week her words/thought process are really worrying me. She is displaying symptoms of psychosis. She has a history of substance abuse, mania, and psychosis. She‚Äôs been to rehab and inpatient multiple times, but has been sober from alcohol and doing very well for the past ~8 months. I did not see this coming. 

When she had her last seizure, her doc had just cut her off her Valium script cold turkey. She was also on adderall (not prescribed). Since then she saw a new doctor, who specializes in addiction, and he has been tapering her off valium and put her on Keppra for seizures. She smokes weed and is sober from alcohol. 

Like stated in the title, she has been saying far-out things this past week and showing signs of psychosis. 

She went to her ‚Äúaddiction doctor,‚Äù earlier this week, and he told her to wait until she sees her neurologist (in a few months,) to get off the Keppra bc she might have epilepsy.

Today, my friend went to the hospital looking for help because she can not think straight. I‚Äôm texting her now and she said, ‚Äòthey said they can‚Äôt help me,‚Äô and to see a neurologist. I know that checking into inpatient is an option, and she is open to it. She packed a bag in case they want her to stay. 

But, I guess they haven‚Äôt told her to check in. What should she do? How can she get help today about her medications and symptoms? 

Is inpatient the only option?

Two years ago i was 170cm 96 kg, and i decided that it was over. I kicked bad food out of my life and in a year lost approximately 10 kg, but everything went really fast from this year. 

I have quit alcohol and processed food and had a calorie deficit everyday for 6 months. Ngl i really hyperfocused on my weight and was weighing me every morning until, in 6 months, i made it to my goal : 69 kg.

The problem is that i‚Äôm still absolutely complexed by my body, can‚Äôt take off my shirt in public and even skipped every summer beach trip with my relatives to avoid having to get myself topless. 
i still feel like i am an obese ugly man when i talk to a pretty woman and am really lacking self confidence. 
i still see my face too fat and my body too and its to the point where its the only thing i watch when i facetime someone. 

Yesterday my doc weighed me, fully clothed with my plateform shoes: barely 60kg

I don‚Äôt even know what answer i‚Äôm looking for i‚Äôm just getting concerned because i‚Äôm obviously not seeing my real self in the mirror.

1697239516.0,I Don't Want to Study,"I feel so stupid typing this but, i started uni about a month and a half ago. I have depression and social anxiety, so i did a lot of planning before the semester so things would go smoothly. I have a college diploma, but it was close enough to commute, but now that i'm getting a degree, i live about a 2 hour drive away from home. First time away from my family for more than a week.

Everything started out okay, but then towards the end of the second week, i found out i didn't register for all the courses i was supposed to take. 4 courses became 6, and 4 of those six are physics chem, bio, and calc. needless to say i've been kind of lagging for at least 1 course because i end up having to shift proprities to catch up. Especially with calc since all my functions knowledge was not put to use during my 2 years in college.

MIdterms start next week, and i'm freaking out. Right now i'm trying to study, but as soon as i cover a concept, i just want to do anything not related to academics. I've been crying more than usual, and can only work in short bursts. Like i can spend a whole day in the library just studying, but my brain will not let me do as much the next day.

1697224649.0,"On a self-mastery journey to perfecting myself, but I feel like I‚Äôm starting to lose my mind.","I‚Äôve been going through a journey of self-mastery for quite a while now. In 2021, I had a strange occurrence where the day following a party, my vision on one eye blurred out and I got in a state of unexplainable confusion, where my thoughts were hard to think about and I generally couldn‚Äôt form thoughts properly except from what‚Äôs going on. Since that day, I‚Äôm not sure if something changed with my brain neurologically, or psychogenically, I started noticing negative changes to how I think and perceive reality. 

I started noticing that particularly socially, my conversations started to get more bland and I found myself lost for responses and ideas. This increasingly grew, and the brain fog started getting really bad. Soon, this brain fog was the only thing on my mind throughout the day, and every small stimulus could bring me back to the thought loops that something is wrong with my body. Thoughts just didn‚Äôt want to stem out and connect with other neurones (eg. If I look at a tree, I‚Äôd just think tree, and it was an effort to make the mental connections)

For almost 2 years I was convinced that this was some sort of brain abnormality, and it caused my subconscious to grow this monster of negativity and anxiety, constantly thinking that it can‚Äôt think. However, a few months back I started to find answers to my questions and clarity on my situation via the wisdoms of self-mastery, which included being aware of my subconscious activity and understanding why it works the way it did. Prior to this, I only really felt like myself a few times a year; clear-headed and articulate, confident and happy. After learning about myself and finding wisdom about how the mind works, it felt like a breakthrough and transcendence. With the amount of valuable information I‚Äôve learnt on how to live life happily, I was seeing myself be in my best forms multiple times a week. 

To make it clearer, I think of it in a way like this. My negative (default) state, is how I usually am - foggy thoughts, bottlenecked personality, low memory and recall etc. Then I have my positive state, where I feel like the a decent amount of the wisdom I need to incorporate into my life to make it good is available. Then I have my perfect state, where it genuinely feels like all the wisdom is available to me, starts to make sense on chasmic levels beyond basic words, and all of it feels like the final puzzle piece was put it. During it I feel euphoric and unstoppable, and I realise that anything in this world is possible and I can be and do whatever I like in the perfect way. I feel so intelligent and positive and all my doubts and questions feel insignificant, and I know that if I make this way of thinking permanent I will live the best life I could imagine. I feel safe being mindful and thus my head is filled with perfect ideas and principles of life, and it feels like I‚Äôm in full control over my thoughts and reality.

However, these states keep fluctuating. Maintaining these positive and perfect states is difficult, because I find myself forgetting the wisdom I need to incorporate and it turn it reminds me that I‚Äôm not that perfect envisionment of myself. I‚Äôve learnt that I‚Äôm a toxic perfectionist, and while I understand that true perfection isn‚Äôt possible, my ideology of perfection is achievable. My goal is to reach this state at least 90% of my days, only feeling negativity when it‚Äôs truly justifiable and valid. My purpose in life is to impact people in positive ways, be that by making them smile, laugh, motivate or help, as it works symbiotically with my happiness. When I feel like people see me as a positive impact, it brings a positive impact to me too.

Now, since the last few days I‚Äôve been trying to microdose shrooms to assist me in this. I‚Äôm not sure whether this is caused by this fact, but the last few days my thoughts and negative states have been worse than ever. It feels like my mind is so quiet, but my subconscious is filled with negativity, and the fact that I can‚Äôt think genuinely leaves me feeling numb and empty. It feels like my subconscious is gaining full control over me and I can just watch it through a glass wall. I really can‚Äôt explain it but I feel so out of it, and thinking feels like I‚Äôm just reading words out a book instead of formulating them. I can‚Äôt focus on anything and can‚Äôt stay mindful, as I‚Äôm soon reminded that I‚Äôm not thinking the way I want to be when I‚Äôm in my positive states. I forget the wisdoms or they stop having meaning, and it‚Äôs like I forget who I even want to be or what this perfect person is. Reading back my wisdom bank doesn‚Äôt help, as my brain needs extensive algorithm style evidence to prove it wrong and that I‚Äôm fine and already this perfect person deep down. I don‚Äôt think the fact that knowing that this perfect state of me is possible, as it makes me crave it more when I can‚Äôt even remember what it is. It‚Äôs really started to drive me mad and I‚Äôm hoping that this isn‚Äôt me losing my mind. What can I do to help me ground myself?",mentalhealth

1697223800.0,Help me understand,"I am in a bit of a mental pickle and it's not something recent. 

I don't know where to start but in short I struggle to keep my mental health stable. Sometimes I feel manically amazing and start doing stuff I would never normally do like wasting money or other really impulsive actions. Then suddenly I will lose whatever I felt. I'll go from feeling near superior to everyone else to feeling like I'm at the bottom of the food chain.

I've tried loving - and that's what I struggle the most with. It's not like I'm not sexually or mentally attracted because the times I have been in a relationship I've been very active. But then suddenly out of literally nowhere it feels as if I can't love anymore. It's not a feeling of losing emotions for someone but rather a feeling that I can't love.
In the two first relationships I ignored this as the the love feelings would come back after some days or hours. In the third relationship I broke down crying to my s/o because I felt the love loss feeling again and I started apologising to her as I explained the entire thing.

I hate this. I want a future with children and a loving family but I can't seem to be able to love properly as I don't want to hurt anyone.

It's not just love being affected but also friendships. I feel I can enjoy a person for so and so long and then suddenly something changes inside of me and I feel I don't want to talk to them. But then I am suddenly okay with them again - and as you can figure this has ruined a lot of friendships.

I have sort of neglected this for years, but did actually seek help when I was younger. My psychiatrist shrugged it off as hormones but now I'm older and I only feel it getting worse.

It might be worth noting my mother is disgnosed bipolar - which might be inherited.

After half a dozen sessions over a few months I feel like I talk in circles, and the few therapists I've seen try to deflect my concerns. They diminish my concerns. They assume I'm being dramatic. After explaining my situation for a few sessions only then do they concede that I'm not making this up, and by this point I've lost interest in talking to them. My most recent therapist actually said something along the lines of, ""Oh, that sounds serious. I was assuming this was going to be a non-issue, but I see this is a real problem."" This is the second therapist who's told me something like this. At that point I'm like, ""Why am I even here? If you don't believe me, why am I even here?""

I've only tried one type of depression med, but cost is scary for me. The one I tried made things way worse. I spoke to the doctor, and he said he was going to prescribe me something new. I picked up the new script and it was the exact same thing as before. It kinda turned me off the whole thing, but honestly I think it will help me.

1697222890.0,Ended long term relationship now struggling with purpose,"32/M I just got out of a long term relationship. We were together for 3 years and lived together for over a year. I wouldn't say it was a ""toxic"" relationship but it was not good for my mental health. I would street more about going home than I did going to work. I stayed with her because my luck with finding women is very low and my rationale was it's this or nothing so this is better than nothing. 

I got promoted to a new department at work and there is this woman who was super attractive and very fun to be around. I've been cheated on so I would never do anything like that. So I practically blew off the woman at work I may poke fun and do ""light flirting"" but nothing crazy. Well she was the catalyst that convinced me that I'm not stuck there is a chance for me to find someone else. So I ended my relationship with my girlfriend and asked her on a lunch date. She denied me because her mom was out of town for her birthday and she was going to celebrate now that she's home. I just played it cool and said we'll maybe next time.

The next week I was going to play things by ear to see if maybe I was picking up her just being friendly as flirting. Well she came back even stronger with flirting. If I was resting my foot on my knee she would slap it off, my other co worker hid her drink and chips and she went to me and started choking me, so I tickled her and she smiled at me. So I'm thinking hell yeah things are good. 

It's now Thursday (the last day of our work week) and there is a happy hour, I talk to her and let her know I'm going (in hopes she goes too). When I show up everyone is talking about relationships (every single person is friends with her which I didn't know yet) one dude keeps talking about how good his lunch date was that he went on... Well it was with her. And they went at the same time I asked her to go out and have lunch. So her name is every 3rd word out of his mouth and I play it cool and stay for a while. Apparently, she was going to show up to the happy hour but ""had something come up"" so she didn't go. 

I get home and text her and basically tell her that I knew they went on a date and he seemed head over heels about her, and I just got out of a long term relationship and not looking for a serious relationship right now. If she's wanting something serious that we should stop flirting but if she isn't looking to dive deep into a relationship that we can go get Friday the 13th tattoos tomorrow. We'll she left me on read so I'm assuming that our tattoo date is off... No biggie

He prefers big tits, big butt. He's called my breasts ""grapes"" and my butt ""egg"". To be fair, I wasn't working out when he first met me, but I've been consistent and in even better shape than ever before and I'm 6 months postpartum. I workout 45-60 min at least five days a week, eat well and not out of boredom. I know it will take time to grow muscles, and I'm trying to advance in weights lifted etc, so maybe it's a time thing, but he always said when he was younger he went for a guy's ideal. And then when he met me he tried caring more about personality, which, is a huge slap in the face to hear. As far as I know, every girl wants to be a guy's ideal, or maybe that's just me. He said their personalities weren't great, and he was just being vain.

He said he can ""like cookies but not have them in the house"" as a metaphor about it, but it's a huge deal to me to be my guy's type. I wouldn't have even entertained this relationship had I known that, but we're deep in it now. Build wise I'd say I'm like average to athletic.

We do plan on having more kids and we're not super well off financially so I can't just go get a b\*\*b job which is the only way to fix that issue. And all I can do with the other is just keep working out hard, which I do at home but he keeps saying I should do at the gym, but with what time? I take care of our baby, clean, cook, work, etc but still make time for workouts that are very intense.

Idk, this is kind of a rant but this is making me incredibly depressed. Of course I want to be the ideal, but I'm afraid I never will be, or worse, that I'm just lazy and am not putting in the work. So like I said I'm trying to push myself even harder with workouts and do more leg focused and glute focused with heavier weights, but in the meantime I feel like crap.

Self love is so difficult for me. I dyed my hair red which was the most selfish thing physical look wise I've done since I was previously blonde and I know he prefers them. On top of this, he doesn't think I'm good intimately. SOOOOOOO, I'm feeling low.

Even when I do feel ""good"" emotions, which I'm lucky if it happens once a month, it feels like a secondary emotion? Like, in the sims having Mood: Miserable (+inspired) Not to mention, even my bad emotions feel secondary most of the time. Hollowness is always there, stronger than anything

I'm fucking scared that I'll never be able to feel happiness sober again. I haven't even tried substances yet, so I'm also scared they can't fix me. At this point I'd do anything.

Sometimes I do self destructive behaviors just so I may even worse; it's honestly better than the hollowness. Sometimes I stop eating/restrict a lot, then I binge eat, sometimes I cut myself. I'm not sure if it counts as self destructive, but I go on spending sprees as that gives me something to look forward to- even though I really can't afford it.

I'll do everyone a favour, and tell my (sob) story succinctly.

1697218368.0,Struggling with Indecision and Apathy,"I've been wondering whether to post this or not; I don't even know if this is a real problem. But for the past few years, I've been living in a state of constant uncertainty, and I need some insights or advice..

It's like I'm living in a perpetual state of 50/50, where I no longer feel strongly about anything.Whether it's a significant life decision or even the simplest daily choices like what to eat, I often find myself stuck in a perpetual state of indecision, as if I'm perpetually balanced on the fence,  and it's even causing me to lose touch with my own values and principles.

For eg- On my birthday, everyone was eager to go out to eat, and I was simply going along with the plan. However, when one member of the group couldn't make it due to illness, the thought of canceling the entire party crossed my mind, and surprisingly, I felt quite content with that idea, equally okay with celebrating or not.

 I've been a vegetarian by birth, but now I feel absolutely nothing when it comes to the idea of eating meat. It's like, ""Eh, it's okay if I try it, and it's also okay if I don't."" This indecision extends to my college classes as well. I attend most of them, but some days I just feel unmotivated or lazy, and I don't even feel guilty about missing them.What's deeply concerning is that it got to a point where I had studied diligently for a midterm exam, but on the day of the test, I just couldn't find the motivation to take it. I was fine with both taking the exam and not taking it. My family was planning a vacation to my favorite resort, and I found myself completely indifferent about whether we should go or not.This might sound stupid, but sometimes I see a homeless person, and part of me wishes I could be in their shoes. Failing out of my engineering degree or living as a homeless person doesn't seem to bother me much.

This constant 50/50 feeling has drained the joy out of everything, and I don't want to keep living like this. I'm 21, and I wish I could feel more strongly about things. Have any of you experienced something similar or have advice to share? I'd really appreciate your insights.",mentalhealth

1697230319.0,I am lonely and I miss my family!,"This just me complaining about missing my family, I am happy about any supporting words.

I moved out of my family home (mother, father, two siblings and three cats) a year and a month ago now, to go study, about four hours away by car, 6 by train or bus, to go study in a different country, as I also want to build a life there, because ours is not that well off. I am the eldest daughter. I really love my studies and everything I do here, I am also moving in with my lovely boyfriend soon, so I am really doing well. Sure, I have a LOT to do, I work and study full-time, but it is working. However, I just really, really, really miss my family.

I used to live in a pretty big, but due to the weird layout still cramped apartment with my family, and I really liked it. It was never really quiet and there is always someone to talk to and spend time with. I loved being given tasks like doing the laundry, cleaning the kitty litter or the kitchen, taking out the trash...I loved watching movies and shopping for groceries with my mom (who is more like my best friend), cooking family meals and discussing pop culture with my dad. Not to mention spending time with my annoying, but lovely siblings, who would play stupid songs on the guitar with me and play videogames as a team. I would always buy or make them lunch and hug them every day after school, help with homework, etc. And the cats would follow everywhere I sat, to cuddle or get their daily 14:00 snacks.  I went from a bustling household, to living pretty much alone. 

Nothing quite feels the same and I miss them all greatly. I understand this is a sacrifice I have to make for my studies, but I am so sad. Genuinely so so sad. I call with my mom and dad every few days and I always call first, but my siblings don¬¥t really bother. They are unreachable. The worst thing is the realization that I will probably never live with them again, unless everything goes to shit here and I lose my job.  I have friends here, I have lovely people around me and still I miss my family so intensely. I just want to go home, but now when I go it feels like their lives have gotten easier without me. No, they are not financially supporting me in any way at all. I just miss my family and I wanna go back to the way things were. And I am sad because I know that will never happen again...

His current delusion was getting worse, but somehow it overlaps with the things he wants to do when he's normal.  
  
I heard the latest from his mom that he said he wanted to start a new life. Quit drinking, smoking weed, cigarette, everything. Hence he asked to be placed into a rehabilitation clinic. This is something I have heard from him before his relapse. On our holiday he told me that he wanted to quit weed and he wanted to seek help when he's back. When he still talked to me in the hospital, he also said he wanted to quit cigarettes but he knew he couldn't do that when he's in the hospital. For context, we live in the Netherlands. He wanted to make everything new, but he said he doesn‚Äôt want to go back home. He said that him and me are already over. He also said to his mom about the marriage, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt promise I‚Äôll be in it forever‚Äù or something like that. It really hurts me.

Reading on the internet I had read that in the first psychiatric visit they usually ask you to do a questionnaire, which however was not done to me... also because I suspect I also have ADHD

1697206464.0,I did so well today - controlling my tears in public,"Ok so I don‚Äôt advocate in the slightest bottling up emotions. However sometimes crying in public can make us feel worse in the long run. 

So last year I was in active trauma at my work. I would get to the point where I would start crying and when I start crying I can‚Äôt really stop. Whether that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm neurodivergent, have complex trauma, or both, who knows.

Today I went into a training group for a new job. I asked a question in front of everyone and the man answered, very passionately, quite forcefully about why we don‚Äôt do what my question was about. I don‚Äôt know if it was because I struggled to read him, felt triggered because of trauma from many authority figures in my life, feelings of humiliation or all of these together but I felt my eyes sting and start to tear up. I didn‚Äôt initially want to leave obviously because the training hadn‚Äôt finished yet, so i focused on my breathing. But it wasn‚Äôt helping and at this point I couldn‚Äôt focus on the training so I excused myself to go to the toilet. Took 5 minutes in the toilet, let myself tear to an extent while I just continued focusing on my breathing and telling myself I‚Äôd been triggered unintentionally, felt embarrassed and told myself I was going to be ok. I knew my face would go red as soon as I was tearful because I get rosacea and eczema so I was scared about going back into the room. I put cold water on my face and it didn‚Äôt make much difference but I managed to stop the tears and walk back in with a smile on my face. I apologised, explained I was hot and felt my rosacea flaring up, and had to go put cold water on my face. Not a total lie but just lied about the reason my rosacea was flaring up. They were cool with it and I managed to complete the training. 

Of course I cried more on the way home, but I told myself my adrenaline will be going for about 90mins and something about understanding the physical aspect of being triggered emotionally helped me from going into a spiralling.

As I said I don‚Äôt advocate bottling up emotions. However I‚Äôm sure most people can appreciate that crying in certain places just attracts attention which makes us feel worse in the long run. I do feel I was able to do this because I‚Äôm not in an abusive situation anymore whereas last year I just couldn‚Äôt stop crying when I started whatsoever. 

Obviously if you are at your wits end and can‚Äôt take it anymore, just cry where ever and please get help from someone. Im just now in a better place so feel more able to do it now than last year. 

So yeah I feel I‚Äôve managed to win a recovery challenge so to speak. I guess we can‚Äôt really recover if we don‚Äôt get a chance to practise recovery. It‚Äôs almost 90mins up after the trigger now at time of posting this and I can feel the adrenaline has almost gone. Yay!",mentalhealth
1697189400.0,I don't feel love for friends: is this mental illness/trauma?,"I am unable to feel love for friends: is this normal?
I am able to love, but I am only able to love romantic partners. The sheer force of the love I am capable of having for a partner is immeasurable, it's something that consumes my entire being, it's like a constant high (not talking about honeymoon phase, but the love itself). They are... everything. But friends? I feel nothing.

I was always like this. I had 0 interest in friends growing up, I longed for romantic love before I even had even lost all my baby teeth. I would avoid people and sit by myself in school. My teacher wanted to send me to therapy but my father refused. I just... did not want them.

Now, I do want to say, I was isolated from kids until age 8, no siblings, and that I faced heavy bullying, so that probably skewed things, but even with that, there is simply no innate desire in me for friendships.

I have ""friends"", and it's not a matter of finding the right person at all for me. I have ""friends"" who consider me one of or their most closest friend. I know every inch of them as people. I have known one for 7 years and by all accounts we are ""best friends"" and close. But I don't feel anything for her? If I could get a free burger by throwing her under the bus, I genuinely would. The only reason why I have ""friends"" is because I see the benefit. I see someone who will do things for you and give you free stuff and possibly be good for job opportunities. But I don't feel anything for them. I cried with them, they cried with me yet even then my heart is stone cold and my emotions were because of social protocol and because it feels like I am a main protagonist in a movie. I have had periods where I force myself to maintain these relationships (tired me out, 0 emotional benefit, only because I stand to gain material things) and periods where I just ignore everyone until, frankly, I have a use for them.",mentalhealth
1697227187.0,What's wrong with me,"This isn't part of my question, but I think it's useful context. A few years ago I started to faint fairly regularly after taxing my body too hard, but I was told that thus was pretty normal for teenagers and after a few tests it was determined that nothing is wrong with my body. 
I also always got a really weird uncomfortable  feeling when watching films where people take drugs, I noticed how I felt the need to scratch my arms and I got weaker in my hands when watching scenes with drugs, but I have never taken any drugs (except alkohol). 

Now to the important part. One and a half years ago a police officer came to our school to give a presentation about smth, I don't 100% remember, but there was a part in his presentation where he talked about drugs and described their effects. While he was describing them I felt the effects he was describing a bit and then slowly felt tingling in my arms and got tunnel vision. Before I could talk to anyone I fainted. This was while sitting down and not after any physical activity. 

Since then I haven't fainted anymore, but about half a year ago when watching a youtube video about someone who had a bullet in his brain and you could clearly see, that he was in great pain, I got the same feeling when watching drug scenes, my arms began tingling, I had to scratch my arms, I got tunnel vision and on top of that I started hyperventilating. I stopped watching the video and got in my bed and tried to calm down, but it only got worse. I started shaking and loosing control of my body. I only lost complete control over the top half of my body, and I could still move my arms a bit, but my hands were completely locked and I was shaking on my whole body. In the end the only way I could alert my parents was by breathing so loud that they heard me. It got a bit better once they came, but they still had to call the ambulance to check up on me. The doctors still said that nothing was wrong with my body. 

Since then I get these kind of panic attacks? pretty regularly, about once or twice a month. They never got as strong as the first time, but they got pretty close. I have to fear that it might happen every time I watch something related to drugs or pain or smth that reminds me of it, it happened even once when I was just listening to music that reminded me of it. 

Does anyone know what is wrong with me? I have an appointment with a psychiatrist, but it will take another half year till that.",mentalhealth
1697199692.0,Am I mentally healthy enough?,"TW: mentions of suicidal thoughts 

Hi guys, I (f,22) have been struggling with mental health since I was 12. I started seeing a psychiatrist and gotten meds when I was 15. Since then i‚Äôve been on different medication and now I see my psychiatrist every three months for a check up. 
I‚Äôve also had therapy before but have been without it for 3 years now.
 
Lately a lot of my friends have been stressing out about their futures - getting more education, getting full time employment, love life and such whereas I don‚Äôt worry about the future at all. They praise me and tell me they love how chill and nonchalant I am about it all but the truth is: I don‚Äôt worry about my future because I always see suicide as a second option.

I would say I‚Äôm ‚Äòpassive suicidal‚Äô (thinking of dying, suicide, just not actively planning it) most of the time, I do not intend to do it but whenever I think of the future and stress that maybe I will end up really lonely, without family and/or jobless, struggling financially ‚ÄúI could always just kill myself!‚Äù

This is, of course, not ideal but as someone who has been dealing with suicidal ideation I can not imagine myself ever not being suicidal and truly wanting to live. But is that enough? Should I settle for this or is there really a possibility of me willingly wanting to live through good and bad, nor matter what?

Are there any of you (or someone you know) that have struggled with suicidal thoughts for a long time and have completely ‚Äòrecovered‚Äô from it? If yes, where did you start? How did it happen? What did you have to do? 
I am torn on whether to keep fighting and striving to get even better or to just accepting this is how I will always be.

1697222849.0,What is this feeling called?,"I‚Äôm not sure whether to call it derealization, or dissociation or depersonalization or something, but it‚Äôs a weird phenomenon that happens when I think about things a little too hard.

For example, one time I was in the midst of kissing my girlfriend and suddenly just felt like I barely knew who she was. I knew what was happening, and I knew it was real, and I knew she was my girlfriend, but I suddenly felt so disconnected and was just wondering ‚ÄúWho is this.. girl? What are we doing?‚Äù

It was like she became a stranger, and while I knew she wasn‚Äôt, it was just really disorienting.

It‚Äôs a bit of an uncanny valley feeling, almost like tripping on acid, and it can make me feel disconnected from anyone or anything for a moment. Sometimes I‚Äôll be with my mom or siblings, and it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúWhy am I close to this person? Am I actually?‚Äù All my past experiences and attachments and memories of this person feel kind of abstract, and they kind of just become this person who I know is my family member, but something is just off and I feel like I have no connection to them anymore.

1697190906.0,Social media is harming my mental health. What should I do?,"I've come to realize how my mental health switches due to what I surround myself with, not only in real life, but mostly on social media.
I've come to notice how I follow some people that constantly make ""hate"" posts (usually hating on someone, sharing personal information about people, pictures and messages and making fun of them constantly), that simply talk sh*t about other people on their story almost everyday and start fights for no reason. And dont get me wrong, everyone is free to do whatever they want with their instagram, but seeing this, over and over, it's so unpleasant and just makes me think that one day these posts can be about me and just gives me anxiety for some reason.
Then I think ""better to just unfollow"", but with this type of people I KNOW it would cause drama if they just realized i unfollowed them. So I dont know if I should just ignore and not see their things or what. Most stupid topic ever I know.

But what should I do? Should I unfollow them even though they and their friends might come for me because of it? I'm at a state that I simply cannot handle drama and stress right now and the last thing I want is having these people causing problems.

But before I wake it‚Äôs like my mind chooses some random circumstance I could be upset about or have been and fixates on it. I will hit my pillow, sit on the floor and cry, vent to myself with so many words of rages, so many unhealthy actions. It‚Äôs been this way for like two years. I used to have horrible night mares/terrors. Had to be on medication (didn‚Äôt work) and never wanted to sleep because the dreams. I got lots of help over the years and still get them sometimes, so I get why I‚Äôm mad those mornings, but no where nears as often (maybe once a month now), so I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs every morning. My mind doesn‚Äôt calm down until I smoke weed, which is probably part of the problem.

1697205929.0,I'm getting homeschooled.,"Since a year ago, my school has really turned to crap. School has been terrible for me and everyone else.

My school doesn't even have enough teachers. Teachers in my school have to teach multiple grades and multiple subjects that they weren't trained for. 

 It doesn't help that my school is very poor. We have to line up at lunch (around 350 students in line) in the hottest part of the day to the ONE water fountain 2 hallways away, where we fill up a small styrofoam cup with a small amount of water. My lunch table regularly finds plastic bits in our fruit or in our sandwhiches.

We have a bug infestation, where there's casually roaches either dead on the ground or under the pipes. 

The principle changed all the routes that the kids who walk home from school are allowed to go. Instead of going the short way, we have to walk around the entire school just to get on the main path. Because apparently the short way is ""too dangerous"" when nothing has happened there other than a few scrap fights and some vaping.

School has been terrible for everyone here, and already over 13 students have un-enrolled in just 4 weeks of school starting this year. I don't want to leave my friends, but I don't want to do it anymore.",mentalhealth

My boyfriend and I are both 18 and in college. We‚Äôve been together for a year. He and I both have struggled with our mental health all throughout our lives. I started therapy a year ago and meds a few months ago and I‚Äôve felt significant improvement. My boyfriend has been on several different medications for several years and tried therapy a few months ago. He stopped attending, saying it wasn‚Äôt for him. Within the past month or so, he‚Äôs talked about feeling like he is at the lowest point of his life. He has expressed that he feels hopeless, that he sees no point in living, that he finds himself worthless and that there is no future. We have discussed topics like this all throughout our relationship and have given support to each other always. I always want to support him and I tell him how proud I am of him for opening up, because I know it‚Äôs hard for him. I‚Äôve suggested several times that he tries therapy again, saying maybe his first therapist wasn‚Äôt a good match for him as I know a lot of first experiences with therapy sometimes do not turn out well. He talks about feeling like these outlets are fruitless and won‚Äôt yield any results. He talks about waking up every day and wanting it to be over. It worries me so much for him because I love him so much and I hate to see him struggling like this. I also know that it is hard to consult another person who has/does struggle with their mental health, and I worry the suggestions and advice that I give him is not the best that he can receive, which is why I‚Äôve tried to encourage him to try therapy again, but he refuses and says that they‚Äôll just tell him what he already knows. He says the medication is unhelpful too. He‚Äôs expressed thinking he is helpless and that nothing he does will ever improve the state he‚Äôs in. I understand it‚Äôs hard to feel hope or motivation in such a state. I‚Äôm just so worried to lose him, that he‚Äôll decide it‚Äôs not worth it and that there‚Äôs nothing I can do to help him anymore. He is the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me and I love him more than I‚Äôll ever know how to express. What should I do? What can I do?

Recently I've been more sad then anything, and I used to enjoy many things. But not now. I do think of hypothetical scenarios on how I could of been a better person overall in the past. But I can't change the past. It's something I have to live with until the day I end up in a cemetery. 

I also have fake thoughts of having friends, happiness, having a good time,  a good life and job. More then anything, I don't really want to make friends or communicate with people anymore. It's not like I had anyone to communicate with, other then one person. I would end it, but I won't because I love my family.

1697207623.0,caught my bf lying several times,"My boyfriend and I met online. We talked and fell in love. He usually likes to talk about his life - ups and down. I‚Äôm the type of who likes to listen and encourages him when he feels down. Our relationship consists of phone calls for hours talking about life - our past, present, and day dreaming. We also watch movies together while we are on calls. 

I have a hunch that some information he is sharing with me are modified but I‚Äôm puzzled to why he would do that. 

First - Age. I understand that he gave his age younger than his actual. He gave 27 instead of 33. I was 29 then. He let me believed he was 2 years ago for several months. As my curiousity grew, I discovered online that he is older than what he says. He pretended to be that age while I knew in the background. One day, I confronted him about it. He was very sorry and said he trying to find a timing to say it. 

Second - Old Habit. Please don‚Äôt judge me but lend him almost 2k usd without seeing his face and meeting him. This is big because we lived in third world country. After, 4 weeks, he confessed that he lost money of 4k usd from online casino. His capital was 400 usd. I got angry because he could have paid me but guess dopamine pushed him to give more. This is lying to me because along those 4 weeks, he kept to himself and asked me some money because he doesn‚Äôt have any. I can‚Äôt remember his reasons why. 

Third - Employment History. For some reasons, I am really good at uncovering information from the internet. I asked him where we previously worked (where I have information to validate it). He chose to lie. Now I don‚Äôt even know whether the present employer is even what he says it is. 

Further info: 

There were also some information he shared that matches the info from the internet.

We haven‚Äôt seen each other not even via video call. I have been flying to his city 3 times but he said he doesn‚Äôt want to meet me at his financial state. 

I noticed he likes to use dummy account because for some reasons he still doesn‚Äôt want to connect to main account ‚Äî he had so many bad relationships

I love him. I always want to keep him safe because he has no one. He has depression. 

I developed anxiety during the course of our relationship. Partly, I am worried he won‚Äôt pay me back but he promised he will. He is very sensitive and cries a lot when subject are discussed.

He spends a lot of time with me and even a great primary support when I have big problems.

I can‚Äôt tell my family and friends because I cheated for this guy. Eventually my other boyfriend left me after 4 months of confession. I‚Äôve been cheating for 8 months or so. 

Im the type who likes to fix people. I probably need help

Questions

1. Is he authentic about our relationship?

2. Any red flags?

3. Im at this point of deciding of breaking the relationship but I am worried that he won‚Äôt return my money back plus he doesn‚Äôt anyone. 

4. Should I see a psychologist now?",mentalhealth
1697205393.0,"Going cold turkey on medication, need advice","Hello. Im 23 year old man and Im diagnozed with unspecified schyzoprenia. I suffer from blunted emotions. I think i don't value my own experience too much and i fantasise about vanishing from space and time. This discreditation of my own experience results in my poor memory. I rarely experience positive emotions. I sometimes cry just to make myself feel alive. And I sometimes take enjoyment out of that, contradictory. I feel like a mess and i can't communicate it clearly to the outside world, and when i do i feel misunderstood. 

I sometimes wonder if I have unspecified schyzoprenia at all. It started when I was teenager and I started taking antidepressants for depression. I was very closed off and isolated. The antidepressants started my psychosis which started as a result of me not being able to sleep by taking them. I started having panick attacks and fear of the present moment. I wonder if this wasn't a signs of unspecified schizophrenia but simply sleep deprivation.

Maybe the the proces of me being in the mental hospital under supervision of doctors made me beleive i was actually crazy or there is something wrong.

I feel excluded from expering what it means to be human. I want to feel alive again, experience joy, excitement, laughter and pleasure and sadness at appropriate times. 

Could someone tell me if its a good idea to go of the meds completely cold turkey?",mentalhealth
1697204644.0,dropped out of highschool and don't know if i should go back???,"hi guys im looking for some advice, ive already talked about this topic before but i got logged out of my old account so im asking again

im struggling with figuring out what to do with my education

im 17 turning 18 early next year and i am meant to be in year 12 this year. last year i was in yeae 11 and i only got 1 term in before my mental health declined extremely quickly and i wasnt able to attend anymore, for half the year in 2022 i was trying to get help in order to go back to school, and was still getting suppourt from my school in hopes of being able to go back, but i didnt get better and had to leave my highschool. the rest of last year was spent in one of the darkest periods of my life, i was out of school and hadnt seen any friends and didnt leave the house more than an occasional appointment with a new therapist that would eventually not work out.

at the start of this year, i went to a new school and was going to redo year 11. i ended up not attending again. i tried my hardest but i still failed and i only went for a few weeks before i nearly had to leave.

then after a 2 week break i got given a second chance to come back for term 2, i was lucky enough that the previous 1 term of yr 11 i did complete in 2022 could be transfered over, and i was so happy. this was a miracld to me because i genuinely thought it was over and i ruined my life and i was a dissapointment. 

anyway i went to an appointment with my principal and he said that in order for me to go back to school, i would have to prove i could attend, meaning for the next 2 weeks i would have to come every single day. immediately in that moment i knew that i had no chance, i couldnt do that, but i told them i could. 

tw/ SI OD

on the drive home i was planning my attempt and oded and was in hostpital for a few weeks. after that i got given a new therapist immediately and the rest of this year was spent waiting for the days to pass untill i had my appointments. i had another od in this time, but i didnt get as much suppourt as before.

so a few months ago i stopped seeing this therapist because i stopped showing up to my appointments, i just couldnt bring myself to do anything, so for the past 2 or 4 months up untill now ive been without suppourt and its been horrendous. 

my parents are trying to get me another one but its too hard because ive already seen all of them near our area. im so sad i wish i opened up to any therapist, because maybe then i could have gotten some real help and been better by now, but i was so closed off and scared. now i wish i had someone to talk to, i have zero suppourt and i really need it.

im struggling with the idea of studying because my parents are thinking of online school next year, but i dont know if i want to go back to redoing yr 11 and 12 to graduate, or if i should just try doing something else. im so confused and just need someone to ask about all of this. ever since i was little ive been so smart and gifted and always put 100 percent into my studies, and the years where it actually mattered i failed. 

ive lost contact with alot of friends from school but have recently been reconnecting with them, but its so hard hearing about all their goals and aspirations, and soon they will all graduate together, and it hurts so much knowing that i wont get to graduate with my friends. im not going to be there with them, im not going to be there with my class, the group of people ive been with for years. it really hurts i wish i could turn back time and force myself to get up and go to school. but i cant. they are all doing their exams now, and it sounds silly but i would do anything to be sitting with them in class struggling with the same exams as them. they are all so busy with life and i wish i could say the same

i feel so behind not only education wise, but in every other aspect, everyone else my age is doing imporant things for their future and have actual lives but im just rotting away in my room. they are talking about the colleges they are getting into and im so happy for them but im also really jealous, i wish i could be normal and functioning

if i want to graduate highschool it would take me like 2 years, and i would graduate at 19, whcih i know isnt bad but it feels so embarassing and i feel so lonely and different, so by the time i graduate all my friends will probably be 2 years into their college courses, maybe moved out, working, travelling idk but i can barely take care of myself without help.

i keep telling myself i need to graduate in order to feel important, to have accomplished something, ill be nothing without a diploma, ill never get far in life without that, it will be so much harder to do anything without it and ill have to prove myself way more to get into courses and other things. i dont want to say im a highschool dropout, it feels terrible. but i know that its not something to be ashamed of and everyone goes at their own pace and im not behind, but it is really hard not to think that. 

also if i do enrol next year it will be in april, so what am i menat to do untill then? just sit here should i get a job? the idea of working makes me want to throw up i cant even cook without ruining it, i feel like a 12 year old in an adult body. im hoping this online school couse is flexible

why cant i just smash out all the important assignments and exams and do both yr 11 and 12 in 1 year why does it have to be like that, why cant i just sit and take exams over and over why is the school curriculum like this im so mad at how much a want a stupid piece of paper that says i finished highschool. the only reason o want it is so that i can rot for like 5 years and i someday i do end up getting better i can just go to university or something but if i dont get it soon, then in 5 years it will be way harder to want to go back again ahhh idk 

sorry im just so confused and i just wish someone older and wiser could just help me and reach out a hand and pull me from this hole im stuck in. sorry this is very long and very messy to read and theres probably alot of typos but i just had to get it out. im not even sure if this will reach anyone but if u have read this far, genuinely thank you it means the world to me

thank u so much stay safe <3

1697203678.0,Family disentjsten about my mental health needs.,"I said family but mainly right now it is my brother. I had a severe mental breakdown while I was at work 2 years ago and had to stop working. I got on SSD and medically retired from my job. It caused me to have severe debilitating anxiety and fear about being in public about the possibility of having another mental breakdown in public almost to the point of passing out. Honestly, the best thing for me was to be left alone in my house and not hang out with anyone. My family didn't understand this and always begged me to do things with them. I said no many times and they looked down on me. My brother for two years has been begging me to go to the gym and do a boot camp program. I told him I was not ready a thousand times. I work out at home and lost 70 pounds. I‚Äôve gotten a lot better about being in public and I talked to a church friend about going to a gym and trying the bootcamp thing. My brother found and called me stupid and dumb for not listening to him this whole time and instead doing it on my own like it was my idea. I‚Äôm sort of aggravated with my family. They are very loving but very pushy and don't listen. I don't want to cut them off, what should I do?

1697202434.0,i hate one part of me,"‚ö†Ô∏èslight talk about sexual assault ‚ö†Ô∏è


im 19f and i love myself but also hate apart of myself alot, for the past couple years, i have been so unbelievably angry for how i am, and it always loops back to, if god actually created us i would be so mad at him and upset because i just hate who i am and he made me this way even tho i dont want it, im not a very sexual person and identify as demi-greyace, and dont want to take part in it unless i really love the person, and i prefer the romantic part of relationship more then anything and even if i did want to have sexual stuff with them, it wouldnt be much happening, and very rare, but i have this hatred for it, i always ask why am i this way, why am i broken and so useless and ugly,  i understand not everyone needs sex in relationships and stuff, but i grew up thinking that and its hard to get out of the mindset when all i have been proved is right, and no matter how much i get told that ill find the one, or it will pass or a man saying ""i dont need sex"", it never helps, it never does anything, or it ends up the guy needing/wanting something from me, and thats okay if someone prefers to have sex/same sex drive with someone, but i always i go back into this knoted ball of anger, and dont understand anything, because i know how much more difficult it will be for me to find love. to find just someone, and have them truly understand how i feel and respect that, and my past with sexual assault definitely has to deal with this hatred and my sexuality, and my last relationship, 

the whole time i knew if i didnt do the things for him, i wouldnt be fully accepted, and loved and, i would be left in the dust, and i hate that, i hate it so much, i just want to be less different, and be able to believe i can somewhat be loved by a person, mostly a man, and i cant physically or mentally do anything about it, its just me, and i have accepted its how i am but i havent been able to love it, and i dont think i can ever love it, i wish i was more sexual just because i want to be ""loved"" and have a higher chance to be loved. And i used to sexualize myself on my own and think how my body is the only thing really going for me, and i should put good use to it, and how no man could ever look at me in the face and see into my head and love me, only there to love my body, and its to the point i have to check my outfits to see if the right places are out, and look good and im trying to tell myself it doesn't matter, and it wouldnt be real love if my body is the only good thing, but it still breakes me down, and im just fighting with myself. 

and i believe making love is a very beautiful thing to experience with a partner, and i enjoy some parts, but knowing and feeling like 99.9% of the men i will meet will with out a doubt want/need/end up wanting to have sex, and not be able to be with me, and me just not being able to give that, is so hurtful to me, because i feel so out of the loop, i feel broken, and of course they can still have feelings for me, but i always feel like i get curbed stomped when having to get told or thinking about getting told, yeah this would be a great relationship but you cant fuck, sorry, and i know love isn't just to have sex with your partner and i know the love i want but, i always end up blaming and hating myself because im not the normal one, they are, they have the ""normal"" instincts and i dont, and it just breaks me. and its no ones fault in the end, and people want what they want, but why do i have to want different things. it makes me, the person who loves romance, and just love, and experiencing it SO MUCH harder, and again i know what i want in a true relationship but i always have my doubts it will end because of me not being sexual. and scared that will shoo every man i meet away to the point i will change and force myself to do anything. i just want someone to admire me the way i admire them, and just love. without sex. and im at a war, and idk if true me will win. because i will and have put myself through situations, example with my ex because i know he wanted it and i did it because i loved him but i thinks its ruined me more than ever. We dated for 2 years and he wanted sexual stuff, even over the phone, and i did them but i truly didnt want to and ofc there's other reasons why we broke up but i know one was because i wasnt sexual. and it hurts, and call me out for wanting ""shallow"" love or whatever you want to call it but i hate this part of me so much, its better to act normal then be myself just to feel something from someone and feel useful and not a broken shell, but of course no matter what that feeling is always there. idk anymore, i just have been accepting ill die alone.",mentalhealth

Ive always been a very self consioucs and iver think everything and have struggled with this. Over the summer i was very much on my own as i live far away from where i went to school so rarely got to do any activities with my friends. A reason that may have caused this sub consioucs feeling was from my irish equivalent of prom, One of my ""friends"" was drunk and spent alot of the night abusing me making fun of my weight appearance and how no one wanted me their. i fear that this has had a negative impact on how i feel in college. To some it up im just wondering how i can try to reduce this feeling of nauseous i get when eating food and sometimes just feel anyway while in my lectures where im around people.

Anyways, today I actually properly brushed my teeth and washed my face. My teeth feel super clean. I used an exfoliator and toner and moisturiser and all that stuff with my face. I got water everywhere but It felt nice. My face is soft now. 

Even though my room is a dirty mess, I barely got any sleep, and my school work is bad right now at least I did something. I don‚Äôt feel completely ‚Äúawake‚Äù if that makes sense but at least I managed to do something today.

1607228909.0,"Just had my cousin's memorial on Zoom, and it was atrocious.","My cousin recently killed herself. We were close when we were growing up. Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. 

I'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she ""succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19"" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to ""heaven"" and not ""hell"" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed ""sin"". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.

I posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying ""Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not."" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. 

They fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. 

I'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the ""eyes of God"". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.

I feel so bad for her. If her parents made \*me\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them.

I guess I have mental health issues but im not in therapy at the moment, the current situation put that a bit on the back burner. But in the past I hated myself and attempted to end my life on a handfull of occasions, getting always closer to breaking and doing it.

Maybe three month ago I was approched by a social worker and he helped me find my way to a home for young men in rough situations in just a couple of weeks. It is still hard to belive how easy that was. For about a month and a half I just kinda houng out and got acclimated but kept some of my old habbits up (not drugs, just kinda being aimless). With Corona crashing the party, I spend all of my time at home and lazed around.

But this week I started to work in the extensive garden. Planting crops, installing watering systems and stuff. Today I planted 100+ onions, waterd some salat and cleaned up a volleyball field. I felt good doing that. Then I had myself a nice cold shower and sat down to write this. Im happy right now. Im happy that I enjoyed work.

Tonight I held a knife to myself, and my cat ran to my side. At first I thought he was just trying to cuddle or get me to pet him, but I then noticed instead of rubbing into my hand, he was pushing the knife away. I broke down into tears and he immediately climbed into my lap. I moved and he laid beside me, and now refuses to let me out of his sight. His little paw is sitting on my arm, and when i move he moves. This is insane, but he stopped it, if it wasn‚Äôt for my cat i‚Äôd be dead. I can‚Äôt thank him enough, he‚Äôs my angel baby.

It really sucks that my mom has abandoned me for a cult.


EDIT: Thank you to all the kind and supportive people. This really hurts, but your empathy is a comfort.

To the folks that think I'm exaggerating or leaving something out, I implore you to drive to a small town, then take in the Trump bumper stickers on every car and Trump banners beside every house. I've driven by multiple Biden road signs with bullet holes in them out in the middle of nowhere. 

I have been trying to get my parents to stop berating me with Trump news for more than four years now. They have ruined dinners out, caused friction in relationships, and generally made my life stressful since the day he decided to run for office by talking about him constantly, aggressively, and refusing to listen to what anyone else has to say. This is not on me or for lack of trying to understand their POV.

I really don't think I'm exaggerating or being rude to state that this is cult-like behavior. A cult is literally defined as ""a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object."" This definitely fits the bill for a lot of small town Americans. Especially if you live in a city, take a look outside the concrete jungle and it's not hard to see why rural folks initially get sucked into this shit.",mentalhealth

But I knew the sand wasn‚Äôt real. I was capable of being a function human, so I decided to be one. I got out of bed, showered and brushed my teeth, I put on clothes and left the house briefly to shop. And then I binge ate crap food, drank vodka, watched 10 hours of tv whilst taking lots of pain meds for back trouble. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm trying to say. I guess I want people to know that I tried. I fought back at my body and forced myself up, forced myself to do the bare minimum of existing and damnit - I was so proud. I want the satisfaction of ‚Äòdoing the healthy thing‚Äô even though it was hard, and then I want the reward to be a sudden ability to live easily. 

But it didn‚Äôt come. I gave in to the dull ache of sadness and consumed sugar, salt and digital crap until I felt sick. I‚Äôm back in bed now thinking about every mistake I made today and how I wish I was stronger. 

I know that a path back to a healthy mental space/ lifestyle is going to be a long, hard road after neglecting it for so long. And I know I have to do it, and do it now before it deteriorates further. I just wish it wasn‚Äôt so intensely challenging. I wish that I didn‚Äôt have to eat healthily, exercise, keep a tidy house, be social JUST TO STAY AFLOAT.

Missing a run means missing on the happy endorphins I rely on to keep me going through the day.

1605033470.0,Adopted a cat during quarantine and it is unbelievable how our bond together has helped ease the pains of isolation.,"So long story short, a couple months ago I was losing my mind feeling trapped inside my apartment with very little to do. Like many of you, probably. It was just me and my roommate going about our usual routine, and life just seemed so... bleak. Then my friend asked if I could babysit his kitten and it was a game changer. I found out cuddling, nuzzling, feeding and caring for a cat was so rewarding and realized how special the bond between cats and humans are. So I adopted my own kitten a few weeks later, and we fell instantly in love with each other. I have so much time to appreciate the little moments between us, to watch him grow, and to witness our bond grow stronger everyday because we spend so much time together. Not only that, but I feel more confident in reaching out to my friends and family on social media/phone again because I don‚Äôt feel alone anymore. I would say if you are feeling alone or you are looking for a sense of purpose during this time, I highly recommend getting a pet, because this is a rare occasion where your bond with your pet will be stronger than ever. If you want to follow my cat on IG, I post almost every day and you can watch him grow too. @finn_the_feline_._._

TLDR; Adopted a cat during quarantine, and our bond continues to grow rapidly day by day. Very rewarding experience and eases the pains of quarantine.",mentalhealth

1612112590.0,CW: Suicide. I almost took my life. Twice. Therapy saved me. But my therapist didn‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs what I mean.,"TL;DR please seek help if you are struggling, if you‚Äôre unhappy, or even if you‚Äôre happy and want to stay that way. There is a light. 

3 years ago, my family home was foreclosed on. 2 years ago my mom had a stroke and was paralyzed and left unable to speak. 3 months ago she passed away after a long battle. I haven‚Äôt been able to speak to my best friend for 2 years and now I‚Äôll never be able to. 

Within that time, I had two suicide attempts. I was on pills. I was drinking alone everyday. I was hospitalized. I was uninsured. I was homeless. I thought I was beyond repair. 

For two years now since then, I‚Äôve been in therapy. Every week for two years. 

Now, I‚Äôm engaged. An awesome step son. I have a good job. A nice place to live. I‚Äôm excited for the future. 

Therapy saved me. But not my therapist. 

My therapist is amazing. He‚Äôs smart. Insightful. Knows when to listen. But when I started therapy, I thought my therapist would just tell me what to do. I‚Äôd do it. And I‚Äôd be fixed. 

That‚Äôs not how it worked for me. 

A lot of my friends who aren‚Äôt in therapy have been afraid to, or too stubborn to go seek help. 

They think they know better than a professional. BUT HERES THE RUB: My therapist didn‚Äôt know how to fix me. 

I did. 

(For me personally) therapy has been about bringing out repressed thoughts and feelings. Things I couldn‚Äôt talk to my friends about. Couldn‚Äôt talk about with my family.

Therapy also made me take accountability. For all my mistakes, the people I‚Äôve wronged.

I can now accept my past and look to the future. A future I wanted to take away from myself. 

I hope if even one person reads this and feels inclined to help themselves. Because you can. 

P.S. I‚Äôm new to Reddit. And I like it a lot. I‚Äôve already made friends. If you need a friend, I‚Äôm here!",mentalhealth

Don‚Äôt give up!","Although I myself still struggle after being raped nearly 2 and a half years ago (and the rape will impact me my whole life) I want to let you know that time really heals wounds.

After, I got raped it was the worst time in my life. There are no words to describe how horrible it was. From a person who was very confident, lived in multiple countries, travelled the world I was afraid to go to my local grocery shop. I nearly had a panic attack when I was alone with a man in a shopping aisle. I had to postpone all my exams, my academic and social life suffered immensely. I had PTSD, anxiety, depression etc. I had very dark thoughts. I considered taking a year out of university because just getting out of bed was a struggle for me. I could write a book about all the negative effects of rape.

But now I honestly feel so much better. Of course, I still suffer the effects. But compared to the past I have made great progress. I am planning to continue my therapy though as I feel like my healing process is not over.

But I want to let you know that things will get better. I have graduated from top 30 university in the world with a prestigious degree, last year I was a committee member of multiple societies at my university. I am looking forward to life.

One thing I would tell you is that don‚Äôt put a timeline or deadline for your recovery. And don't compare yourself to others. I used to wonder will I ever get better. Why I am not getting better already? Why is it taking so long? Don‚Äôt compare your recovery to someone else. Although I will recover the whole of my life, what I mean is that If you are not getting better/progressing in a certain period of time is okay.

Everyone is different and take as much time you need to heal.

For me, it was also hard to see all my friends enjoying life and this tragedy happening to me. But now I am slowly accepting that life didn‚Äôt turn out exactly the way I wanted. And bad things happened to good people.

They often take general things that could apply to almost anyone and try to claim they're a result of mental illness. They'll title a video something like ""10 signs you might have bipolar"" and then list things like ""You like to hang out with friends sometimes, but others you prefer to spend time to yourself"", or ""Its hard for you to stay focused on just one hobby"". Plus, they have a bad habit of labelling EVERYTHING as a ""trauma response"". You're a picky eater? Trauma. You get nervous around crowds? Trauma. Theyll even say that PRETENDING to have trauma is a sign of trauma. It seriously pisses me off, because what they're doing is causing great harm to those who actually struggle with mental health. It delegitimizes the experiences of those with mental illness, and it makes a lot of people assume that mental illness' aren't actually too big a struggle to have.",mentalhealth

1591624996.0,"I Am Thoroughly Disgusted By The Portrayal of Mental Health in 13 Reasons Why Season 4, And Disturbed By the Amount of People Defending It.","13 Reasons Why has always been controversial from the start. I understand where people come from when they say the first season glorified suicide. Personally, I believe the first season had good intentions, and truly was trying to raise awareness for suicide.

Of course, they completely sabotaged Hannah Baker‚Äôs character in S2, which had a detrimental effect on the message.

But Season 4 - oh, it makes my blood boil. Clay‚Äôs undiagnosed, undefined ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù - at best described by the show as ‚Äútrauma‚Äù - is used as an excuse for outrageously bad behavior. By bad behavior, I mean locking his friends in a cabin in the woods and clanging an axe against the door. I mean vandalizing his school and burning his principal‚Äôs car. I mean waving a gun around in front of the entire student body.

And worst of all, when he finds out his adoptive brother is dying, his immediate response is to run to the police station and yell, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a gun!‚Äù Why? Because he needed people ‚Äúto see how broken he was.‚Äù

This one really hit me close to home. When I was 6, my infant sister had to spend all 4.5 months of her life on a ventilator in the hospital. When she died - near Christmas time - I did not go terrorize people so that they could see ‚Äúhow broken I was.‚Äù

Yet [few people](https://youtu.be/ynewf90xWZc) see it that way. When I say this, 13 RW fans tell me ‚ÄúWell, you were 6. Your emotions were not as deep as our beloved FICTIONAL character Clay.‚Äù

I rang in my 24th today in a room with a baby suspected for COVID-19 who was very sick. I was holding the baby while the doctor was doing a lumbar puncture. Wearing the same mask I've been wearing all day and full gown, face shields, gloves.

I could feel my phone vibrating with messages from friends/family. I'm not even an emotional person but I just started crying silently. Everyone was so concentrated that no one noticed. I went to the back after and spent 20 mins having a good cry while listening to the stable song from BOTW (LOL).

1599744998.0,I feel bad for my cat because we don‚Äôt have a routine anymore.,"When I had a predictable schedule, my cat would make sure I followed it to the letter every morning.

He woke me up right before my alarm so there was time for me to pet him. Then would hop off and meow until I got out of bed. Then led me to the bathroom, and would wait on top of the toilet until I was done showering. If I took longer than ten minutes he‚Äôd start meowing. Then he‚Äôd sit on top of my counter and watch me brush my teeth, and try to grab the floss as I was using it. Then he would hop down and strut in front of me, looking behind to make sure I was following, and lead me to my bag. Once I picked up my bag, he‚Äôd lead me downstairs to the kitchen. He would then sit on one of the chairs and watch me cook and eat breakfast, and when I was getting all ready to leave, he would wait for me to walk over and pet him goodbye for the day.

When I got home, he‚Äôd be waiting for me. He‚Äôd lead me back upstairs and stand in the spot my bag‚Äôs supposed to go. Then we‚Äôd play fetch with toy balls and I‚Äôd give him lots of pets until we tired out. Then I would get on the computer for work and games, and he‚Äôd hop into his cat bed nearby and fall asleep. When it was time for bed, he sometimes even got up to lead me to the bathroom and make sure I was brushing my teeth, then go back to bed.

Since the pandemic started, I‚Äôve had nowhere to go. Nothing to do. And even several months later, I can tell he misses the routine. He still tries to wake me up on time. He‚Äôs been trying different tactics. The most effective one so far seems to be bringing a toy and doing cuddle rolls just out of reach of the bed so I have to get up to pet him. He still meows if I‚Äôm in the shower for more than ten minutes. When I do finally go downstairs, he rushes ahead of me halfway down and leads me the rest of the way. He frequently makes circles around my feet as I‚Äôm on the computer, asking for pets and playtime. It breaks me heart when he does these things. I know he‚Äôs trying so hard.

Then this evening I was at work delivering pizzas. I went to this one house and I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was at the right address or not but there was a man in the driveway and I asked him if I was at the right address. He said he wasn‚Äôt sure because it was his bosses house, not his, and he was only there to pick up his car. Then we started talking and he mentioned how I was smiling. He spoke about how he was 63 years old, he was a military veteran, and how with people my age he doesn‚Äôt see people smile like I did. It was a fake smile I put on so when I greet customers it‚Äôs a good experience. But he picked up on my smile, we chatted and he was making me laugh, he ended up giving me a big hug and was telling me how I should appreciate my friends, my family, and life. This guy had no clue I was depressed and suicidal and was planning on taking my life 3 hours later, yet he still told me all of this. He ended up giving me some cheese he had (I didn‚Äôt eat it) but the reason why he gave it to me is because  the packaging had a huge smile on it and he told me to have it and to keep on smiling and spreading positivity. 

This guy was only at the house to pick up his car, he was only there for 5 minutes, yet in that 5 minutes is when I showed up. If that delivery was 5 minutes earlier or 5 minutes later I would have already taken my life, but the timing was perfect, and I‚Äôm still here.

She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open.

If they are trying hard to hide it, it's possible they're struggling more since they have to hold it in. Also, if someones symptoms don't seem as severe as your own, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem and therefore aren't entitled to get help. Kids shouldn't need to come out about being depressed by attempting suicide because they have no other way to prove it's a real problem that they deal with. And they definitely shouldn't have to go as far as to commit suicide to show they've struggled.

&#x200B;

I want people to get help without being told their OCD is for attention, and that their depression is just an excuse to be lazy, their anxiety is just an excuse to avoid doing things, or their ADHD is just an excuse to misbehave. If people are so worried over others faking this stuff for pity, then maybe don't give them pity and that's the problem solved then? Instead of giving them the things you think they're faking problems to get, try to push them to see professional help and leave it at that instead of going out of your way to make it worse for them.

&#x200B;

Nobody should be allowed to do terrible things and get away with it by blaming their disorder, I get that. If someone you know is doing that, treat it like the law does: don't punish or hate them, but maybe send them to a psych ward to get help if they truthfully are harming others because they can't control themselves.

&#x200B;

If anyone out there is afraid to come out about a struggle of theirs because they're afraid of being called an attention seeker, don't hold back because of people like this.

This sub is for ranting and asking for help. People who need that help I feel should be welcomed and helped out. But if someone is actually to the point where they might end their life and they are looking for help, and all they see is people talking about killing themselves or self harming, that will only make it worse for them. I found this sub to maybe rant or get advice on how to better myself but a majority of the posts I‚Äôve seen are just people saying they are going to end it or asking how they should do it.

1620741702.0,Is depression actually just a heightened awareness of the pointlessness of life?,"Something that often comes to mind.

It's common for a lot of people suffering with depression to feel that life is pointless and a waste of time. When I think about it, the only logical purpose to our existence is to procreate; which arguably could be seen as pointless, as it's ultimately unfulfillable. This train of thought always leads me to the same answer; which is that my depression isn't caused by some sort of chemical imbalance, or poor circumstances, but the understanding that my life is in fact pointless.

Is this shared, and if so, how do you overcome (or bypass) these thoughts to allow a productive life?",mentalhealth

1598043950.0,You don't need to have a crazy story to be valid,"I have had an insane life full of dark trauma, abuse, alcoholism, suicide, despair, extreme loss, stalking, harassment, and destitution. For years I wanted to die and I begged my mother for permission to die to end my suffering. I literally got my brain zapped 14 times to fight it (ECT is actually very safe and effective for severe treatment resistant depression). But all those labels don't matter.

So let me tell you a few things: 

1. Your suffering is as equally valid as mine. 
2. Everything is relative. You can have an amazing life and still be suffering.
3. Your suffering does not need justification. You feel what you feel. Screw invalidating statements like ""It's just hormones"".
4. We all have our own journey don't compare your life/struggles to those of others.
5. You deserve growth as a human being even if you don't feel like you do. Our illnesses cloud our perspective of the past, present, and future.
6. Don't believe everything you think.
7. There is no ""cure"". Suffering is part of human existence and by learning to accept it and sit with it we can overcome it.

1573251025.0,Would someone take the time to wish me a happy birthday? I don't have anyone and don't want to feel so alone today.,"Today is my birthday and this sounds pretty sad, but I just want someone to wish me a happy birthday and maybe say something nice. I no longer have any friends or family left and just want some sort of human connection, even if it is just over Reddit, to make me feel just a bit less isolated and forgotten.

I have just endured so much lately and I don't have anyone to talk to or confide in, but I thought I could make it through today just fine. I was wrong. I feel stupid and pitiful while I'm typing this, but I just want to know someone is out there and understands.Getting to this point happened without me even realizing how solitary I had become until I was completely alone. I might as well lay it out, as just the act of typing it might be some sort of catharsis.

So how did I end up here? I started typing out damn near my whole life story, but that made this post so long that if I left it included there was an even smaller chance someone would read this. So highlights then? Abandoned by parents, raised by grandparents, abused by neighbor from ages 5 to 8, horrible abandonment issues, started getting into drugs, dropped out of high school, got a GED, some life happened, was totally Goth, some more life happened, made some music and art, now only Goth on the inside, started college, got married, wife left and grandparents arrested/institutionalized due to Alzheimer's/dementia in the same weekend, abruptly left college to move home to sort everything out, oh hey drugs, slowly watched my only family deteriorate before my eyes until they didn't even recognize me any longer, raging heroin addiction to try not to feel any of this, grandfather died, got in trouble with the law, lost everything I owned, homeless junkie interlude, lost almost 3 years of my life in jail/prison over less than $4,000 worth of bad checks, oops can't get a decent job due to criminal record, congestive heart failure, almost die, start getting my life back together, meet a nice girl, marry nice girl, grandmother dies, oh hey again drugs, finally got off the drugs, surprise wife departure, heart failure keeps getting worse, can barely walk, can't work anymore, no job, no insurance, no access to healthcare.

That about sums it up the backstory. I finally have gotten some healthcare and counseling. Sadly, I can no longer work. I'm trying to go through the disability process, but that takes a great deal of time. It is difficult without proper access to the doctors I need, but I'm getting there. I've also been clean for 4 years and I'm never going back to that dependence. Never before in my life did I ever feel like I was completely done with drugs, but this time it has really stuck. Haven't even had any cravings and now it never even crosses my mind. I'm finally in a good and stable place in my recovery.

Now I have other issues though. Poverty is very real. The threat of eviction looms nearly every month. Being able to afford the 12 different prescriptions I take is really hard and I find myself cutting pills in half because even $70 a month for medicine is a real challenge. I was able to get enrolled back in college and that is the plan of how to survive until I graduate and find work I'm physically able to handle. I'm working towards a career in counseling because I want to be able to use all of these nightmare experiences to help other people. I want to use what time I have left on this planet to help others and hopefully leave it better than I found it.

That is how you end up alone on your 40th birthday, typing on an ancient laptop that you pray survives a couple more months until you transfer schools and can get a replacement with financial aid funds. My family died. Drugs pushed everyone away for years except other drug addicts and an addict isn't anyone's friend. I am no longer able to work, so I don't have those human connections anymore. My wife had been my best friend, so when she surprised me by suddenly leaving the last person I had a connection with went with her. Now that my congestive heart failure has progressed just walking enough to shop for groceries, take out the trash, or getting the mail is a huge challenge, so just going out to walk around and meet people is near impossible. Having zero available disposable income also doesn't help. If I can hold on a couple more months and everything works out I'll be able to switch schools and have more aid options that will take care of my financial and healthcare needs. I'm just trying to hold on and it is so hard.

There is the abbreviated story if you somehow stopped on this post and actually read through everything. If you made it this far, thank you for listening. If you have the time to say happy birthday or say something nice I would really appreciate it. You really don't know how much it would mean to me. No one else is going to tell me today, so you might get to be the only person that wishes me a happy birthday. I don't get any presents or any cake. I don't get a birthday meal or get to do anything cool. I don't get to go anywhere or see anyone. There won't be any birthday cards in the mail or celebratory emails. That's okay though. If one person manages to take the time to read this and let me know there is someone, anyone out there then it'll be alright.

Edit: Update - Thanks so much to everyone. I barely have any words. Just thank you all so very much. You did bring a grown man to tears, but the best kind.

It happened so fast that I didn‚Äôt even finish paying for my ticket yet. Everyone came up to try and help him until the ambulance got there but the amount of blood and how far the car launched him, I knew he wasn‚Äôt going to make it. The EMTs got there, checked his pulse and immediately got him on the stretcher and used the defibrillators. The ambulance rode off. No sirens. No lights. No nothing. I got up and just walked back to my job in total shock. All I could and have been thinking about is the brief couple of seconds where I was able to see him before he died. Looked like a teenager and he looked like he just got off of work himself. I especially remember his long dreadlocs because some of them had ripped out and was laying in the street. Tried to tell my family what I saw and it seemed like no one cared, especially my mom. She seemed more upset that she had to come pick me up while she doing Lyft. After the shock faded I thought I was okay until I tried going to sleep. That entire part of my day kept playing back on loop. Couldn‚Äôt sleep so tried watching tv but I couldn‚Äôt pay attention to what was going on. Then I started thinking about all the times I‚Äôve stepped into the street without thinking for hours. My body eventually gave out and went to sleep. Woke up feeling like shit so I asked my mom for a ride to work. During the ride she asked me why I looked depressed. Didn‚Äôt say anything. Then she asked me if I was able to complete some chore yesterday and when I said no she started going off on me. Telling me that I‚Äôm lazy and I don‚Äôt care about anything. I got angry and yelled at her and told her imma still fucked up from yesterday and she told me to ‚Äútoughen up and leave that shit in the past. You didn‚Äôt know him ‚Äú after that I asked her to just drop me off wherever because I just was sick of her attitude. I eventually got to work but I had to walk past the spot he got hit at. I cried.

When a person feels like nothing will ever get better, and death is their best option, it is not impulsive.

Outside sources cannot label suicide as ‚Äúimpulsive‚Äù when they do not know the severity and dexterity of the persons situation.

^^ In this post I‚Äôm talking about every situation being called impulsive, because there very much is situations where it is impulsive, which is not to say that it‚Äôs any harder or easier, it‚Äôs just different, and a lot of times non impulsive behaviors or situations are labeled as impulsive, and having been on both sides it can be very frustrating.

1591478215.0,Stop telling boys that they shouldn't cry.,"When I was around 10 years old, I watched my teenage brother nurse a wound. He was crying as he soaked¬†his scraped knee with water in the bathtub.

I looked at him with disdain. ""Why are you crying?"" I asked in annoyance. I didn't realize it then, but my visceral reaction to his emotional vulnerability reflected¬†something¬†that I had been taught earlier¬†in my childhood: boys aren't supposed to¬†cry. 

When I became a young adult, I had a lot of trouble expressing my emotions. I put on a smile for everyone I saw, and avoided talking about anything that would trigger an emotional reaction. When my emotions built up to the point where I couldn‚Äôt control them, I would explode. It took a long time to learn how to share my feelings - something that people still consider to be a sign of weakness in men.

I think I‚Äôm one of the millions of men out there who‚Äôve been told, at some point in their lives, to repress their emotions. I now understand how emotional repression can¬†lead¬†to a variety of complications in mental health. I wrote a song to challenge the idea that men shouldn‚Äôt show their feelings simply because they are men. Listen link below.

For all the guys out there listening to this song - be vulnerable. Feel your emotions. Share with others how you feel. I think that‚Äôs even more manly than being a tough guy.

It has been two weeks, I was basically out of money in a new city, have searched everywhere for a job but couldn't find any, so I decided to go to the social services center at the town hall to see if they could help me anyway. Shared with the staff my story and how I was going to be homeless that same day, but since it is a small city, the social worker contacted a friend of hers that owned a place that was looking for a woman to cook, clean and receive guests at a private tourist attraction.  

Although I'm male, she decided to give me a chance, and so it has been two weeks of hard work but everything is working out so far. I actually like the job a lot, and my employer seems to be quite happy with my performance and already increased my salary from past week. 

My anxiety and depression are way under control now. It seems that since my work requires more doing and less thinking it just keeps my mind better focused in the job and been glad for this opportunity that while I still get some intrusive thoughts once in a while, they are way less aggressive than they were in the past few months/years.

So that is it. Just sharing a story with a better ending than I expected so that, maybe, it give those of you guys who are still facing harder times, a glimmer of hope that things may get better for you too.

I had this grand plan when I left highschool. I wanted to study outside of the US. It was really difficult to find a way to do it, but I had a dream and I was so determined to accomplish it. But depression hit me bad and I almost didn't graduate highschool, my parents didn't support me and I wasn't able to go to college because of it so I was forced to take a gap year. I broke my foot and was bed ridden for 6 months and became very depressed. Finally got to uni and failed the first year. Just failed my 2nd.

1642431191.0,"Can you be a ""highly functioning"" chronically depressed person?","I've been feeling just awful, unmotivated, anxious, unhappy for at least three years now. There are ups and downs to this feeling, though it never goes away completely. Sometimes it gets very bad for a very brief moment, but even then I am able to perform daily tasks, I take care for my dog, I keep myself and my flat \[relatively\] clean, I even eat well. I'm reliable. My job situation is not the best, but I somehow manage from paycheck to paycheck. I manage, I just struggle *inside* all the time. There is not a day that I don't feel (at least) ""a little down"".

Whenever I feel like seeking help, I remember some people I've known who were diagnosed with depression. Some couldn't get out of bed for weeks, some seemed to have disappeared from the face of earth for months. Many self-harmed. Compared to them I'm completely fine, just oddly upset, resigned and a little fearful 24/7.

I feel like I'd be wasting a psychiatrist's time with my crap. On the other hand I think that I backed myself into a corner. I'm keeping my head above water, so I'm not drowning, but I can't get out of the water either, because I'm too weak. Can I be depressed?

1646349969.0,Calling Suicide Selfish,"I saw someone on my friends list post about someone they knew who committed suicide being selfish and I am not in the mood to play around about this. Let me fucking tell you something. I am so sick and tired of hearing people say that suicide is selfish. You want to know what's fucking selfish? Expecting someone else to live for you. Expecting someone to put their own personal pain to the side for your fucking happiness. Expecting your relationship or companionship to be that saving grace to pull anyone through a deep depression. THAT is the epitomy of selfish. It is no one's responsibility to do anything that makes other people happy or comfortable. You are not owed any of that. You don't get to tell someone who's suicidal that they're selfish for considering it and that they should think about others egos before their suffering. You don't get to call someone selfish after they commit suicide because they didn't think about everyone else's feelings when they obviously couldn't even handle their own. On top of the fact that it's disrespectful to speak ill of the dead. How selfish do you have to be to have the audacity to call someone selfish when you are the one who wants a dangerously depressed person to continue suffering just so you can continue to ignore all the symptoms but hand them a god damn gold start sticker for being alive like it fucking helps anything? And before you even bring religion into the conversation, news flash, Not everyone believes in your God so telling someone ""God doesn't make mistakes"", ""Suicide is a sin"", ""God only gives us what we can handle"", or some other idiotic bullshit, doesn't bring everyone comfort and sometimes it makes things worse. And that's not your opportunity to tell them all the ways they need to find God. Because again: Not. Everyone. Believes. In. Your. Fucking. God. End of. Telling a suicidal person that wanting to end their pain is selfish will only tell them that they cannot confide in you and it marks you as an unreliable support system. It will more than likely make them pull away from you and make them feel even more isolated. YOU'RE NOT HELPING! And don't use the excuses ""I've been through worse and I don't want to kill myself"" or ""Other people have it worse"" because you obviously don't understand what mental illness is. Being depressed about a situation is so much different than being clinically depressed. Situational depression lasts through a particular struggle. Clinical depression is being sad for almost no god damn reason. Don't compare the two because you're only making yourself look like more of an asshole. It is selfish of you to want someone to continue suffering just to make you happy. Get off your fucking high horse.",mentalhealth

I‚Äôm all for expressing emotions in a healthy manner and using music as an emotional outlet, and certainly want to hear music that is honest... but not at the cost of minimizing the pain and struggles that people all over the world face on a daily basis. 

Being broken is not beautiful, being broken is sobbing uncontrollably when you have a delay getting your meds refilled while your boyfriend strokes your hair trying to convince you that things will get better.

1586738653.0,It‚Äôs been 10 years since my suicide attempt and I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt succeed!!,"Somehow I missed my 10 year anniversary of the worst day of my life. I suppose that‚Äôs a good thing that I‚Äôm so involved with the good bits of life now that I almost forgot that this wasn‚Äôt always the case. 

Ten years ago I threw my legs out a 6th floor window at college, intending to hit the earth below me. I was in the thick of some really terrible times then. I was 19, heartbroken, homesick, lost, and very confused. I remember the sharp air that rushed in the room when I opened the window that very cold and snowy February night. It felt like little needles on my skin; a stark contrast to the hot, salty tears streaming down my face. I was in trouble for drinking on campus...again.  However, the drinking wasn‚Äôt just purely fun and games. I was using it to cope with a lot of uncertainty and hopelessness. My on again off again boyfriend told me he was dating someone else. He lived with my best guy friend at the time so a lot of ‚Äúsides‚Äù were taken in the whole mess. And somewhere along the way my roommate moved out. I was alone. 

I spent the remainder of the week at the hospital under psychiatric care. The days I spent there blur together now. I was in such a haze of numbness. 
My entire life was uprooted. I got kicked out of college and I had to start over somewhere new. The next several years were spent kicking my ass into gear to show myself and the friends who abandoned me that they didn‚Äôt get the best of me. I pushed and pushed myself. I started looking forward and not backward. I learned to love myself again. Slowly. Very slowly. 

I graduated from a new (and better) college with honors two years later. I took a chance and bought a one way ticket to NYC and began living the life I used to only be able to dream about.

10 years later, I am living proof that things get better. Depression and anxiety are challenges I still deal with occasionally, but now I know how to handle it. 

Right now I‚Äôm sitting in the house I just bought all by myself. I‚Äôm reminiscing about the years I spent living and working in Manhattan, where I had an incredible job and amazing friends. Most days, my life felt like a happy movie. I recently decided to re-locate, slow things down and enjoy the present. Now I‚Äôm in the process of renovating my house from the inside out. I volunteer with an organization that raises funds for underprivileged women and children. I carve out time for my hobbies, friends, and loved ones. I‚Äôve truly become a better person. I can now enjoy a glass or two of wine without overdoing it just to cope. I can take a deep breath, a small sip, and appreciate how far I‚Äôve come.

I still have a long way to go. I‚Äôm still a work in progress. I haven‚Äôt found love yet but I look forward to the day I do. In the meantime, you can catch me cultivating my new herb garden and reading a good book or two. 

If you‚Äôre going through what I went through 10 years ago, my best advice is to hang on, know it does get better (and no this isn‚Äôt something that people just say. It‚Äôs true). You‚Äôre not alone. You‚Äôre loved. And you‚Äôre stronger than you think.
Take a deep breath, be thankful that you are able to do so, and repeat until you truly believe better days are around the corner.

1638625610.0,"How I became a happier and kinder person, and accidently started liking myself a lot more","I did a random experiment on myself a few years ago. I did not read about this anywhere, I just thought of it and decided to try it.


I forced myself to think nice thoughts about every stranger I see. When I see someone on the street, I think of something nice about that person. Like ""their hair look so good"", ""what a nice smile"", ""those legs are great"" etc. In the beginning it was hard. Like, the first thought that popped up was something mean, but then I followed it up to find something good about the person.


If I don't find anything nice to think about their appearances (it happens), I don't force it, instead I make a nice assumption about them. I think ""she probably has a great sense of humour"", ""he is probably a great dad"", ""this person could be very creative"" etc. Just whatever pops up, and the great part is, it doesn't matter if it's true or not. I just form a nice assumption in my mind. 


In the beginning I had to consciously make the decision to think something nice. After a while it started automatically happen. It's been years, but now every time I go out I think mostly kind thoughts about people. This lead me to think more nice thoughts about myself. When I see myself in a mirror, I'm no longer trained to search for flaws, I automatically think nice things about myself aswell. I'm a much more confident person due to this.


If you want to try this, I recommend starting with strangers. When that becomes natural, apply it to everyone. Your classmates, your colleagues, your friends. Force yourself to focus on the positives. If you think something negative of someone, thats perfectly okay, but follow it up with something nice. Now I have an easier time giving people spontaneous and genuine compliments, because that's how my mind works. I'm a lot happier and calmer around people when I think kind thoughts about everyone. And this is not something that happened naturally, I had to train myself to do this, and it worked!

I want to add, that I've had some friends that were the opposite. The kind that thinks it's fun to roast everyone they see and say mean things about strangers or acquaintances. I talked to them about this, talked to them about how I'm changing my mindset and asked them to not behave like this around me. Some changed, some I am no longer friends with. Not a big loss, in hindsight. People that act like that was a negative influence in my life anyway. 


If you try this, good luck, and please let me know how it goes for you :) It will probably feel super weird and silly in the beginning, but try to stick with it for a while and see what happens to your thought patterns!",mentalhealth

1590025748.0,My suicidal thoughts and depression.,"If you're reading this can you please upvote it so others can see, thanks for reading this as well it just helps me I guess.

My names Jack, I'm 15 years old, bi (not come out to anyone), have dandruff, acne, pretty fucking ugly all things considered... And severe anxiety and depression.

I was living great until last June. At the time I had 2 best mates, who I'll refer to as M (funny, kind but not entirely good to talk about mental health and touchy feelings) and K (kindest person ever, used to be able to speak about anything to, but mentally isn't great). K had severe mental health issues and was not listening to anybodys advice about seeking help. Eventually I asked M if I should confront her about it, he agreed, I did it because my other friend who I'll refer to as J (narsasistic, arrogant, but has a soft side occasionally) had been telling me for months she was an attention seeker. I figured she'd take it alright but I was wrong. She trusted me more than anyone (her words) and it was the worst thing anyone had apparently told her.

It bothered me alot and I kept trying to make ammends because I felt TERRIBLE.

I was relatively stable in the grand scheme tho.

2 months pass and August aka summer holidays hits! Worst month and a half ever. J had somehow convinced M I was basically a backstabbing, lying piece of shit and essentially the worst person ever.

We argued back and forth for a while. We fell out hard to say the least.

It broke my heart losing both M and K (I guess J) in such a short time and the misery started to sink in.

HOPE WASN'T LOST. I had 2 friends left B (kind, nice to talk with, quiet) and Z (think J but a geek gamer and a textbook bully) I had a plan to get M K and J face to face (all previous stuff was done by text). Z was on holiday. So I tried asking B to get them together, he said to wait until school but I insisted as K didn't go to our school. I accepted tho. However (according to what I've been told) B lied I think and told Z I had manipulated him into trying to get them all together. Z bullied the shit out of me.

This is where I think my depression sunk in, I couldn't think properly, lashed out in anger out everyone, was bored of gaming, etc. Moral of the story, I wanted to put a bullet in my head!

September hit and school started (year 10). Depressed anxious and suicidal my studies went down and thus my grades.

Then my parents split, IT SUCKED. My father isn't exactly great, he can be abusiveish at times.

Everything started to get worse and I ran away several times, and dragged a knife across my arm alot.

I started to sit in the library for most of the day and still did until corona. Got sent work and it definitely helped with my anxiety as I was bullied and a laughing stock in year 9. Pretty badly. So being out of lessons was alright.

I started seeing the school councillor which helped to have someone to talk to. 

In December the school had no choice but to take me to arrow park hospital as I had massive scars across my chest from self harm. I stayed overnight and my parents ended up kinda talking things out.

I had to go to therapy to say the least. I was still on the edge of suicide.

Started the 8 week course this January and it was alright. Helped keep me positive. 
J and Z made me want to die more as they constantly reminded me of what I am, a monster. Told me I was worthless, should just do it and brought up my Instagram stories (I used to post on them suicidal stuff as a cry for help but was just accused of attention seeking). Worse too. 

Throughout the next 2 months I still stayed mostly the same. Suicidal, depressed, anxious, most importantly lonely. Me and M eventually worked things out because I actually put the effort in a lot over several months begging him and K to help me and how sorry I was. They didn't really want to be my friend. K and I are currently on OK terms I think, imma take it slow with her. M and I talk a lot now.

But... I still feel lonely, have to hide how I feel now. Don't really have anyone to talk about this stuff to. Anymore at least. I still hate my life. Want to die. Does make me wonder if I'm actually really liked by anyone.

But how would I describe myself? Gamer (mk11, overwatch, paladins and smash), want to do well but knows I can't, socially awkward on 1 to 1s, try to be funny, nice to people who I care for and are nice to me, would die for my closest friends.

I'm 35, and I know my personality disorder is going to lead me further down a dark path of self-harm. People won't put up with a middle-aged man who acts one way today, another way tomorrow.

1610682310.0,Recovering from depression really feels like I‚Äôm trying to stay ‚Äúsober‚Äù,"First I‚Äôve never had to deal with substance abuse, and if what I saying is insensitive please let me know.
 
It really does feel like what I imagine abstaining from alcohol or drugs feels like, but instead of that, your abstaining from bad choices. For example, can‚Äôt stay out with friends because if I don‚Äôt have a regular sleep routine, it will drastically effect my mood. Can‚Äôt drink a lot of caffeine because it will effect my sleep schedule and my mood. Can‚Äôt drink alcohol because with messes with my medication and my mood. Can‚Äôt think those negative thoughts or otherwise I will spiral. Can‚Äôt stay in bed all morning, or otherwise you‚Äôll stay in bed all day or even several days. I have to perform basic hygiene even though it is really hard today, or else you‚Äôll feel ten times worse.

Was wondering if anyone else felt like this?

Edit: oh wow! I did not expect this to get any comments or votes. I have suffered depression for over a decade, staring in my teen years. I did not get the help that I needed until recently, and therefore developed many bad habits to try and cope with it. But for the past few months I‚Äôve been working on getting better, but then I spiraled really bad during the holidays because I strayed from my rigid routine. So now I‚Äôm trying to start all over again. But it really helps to know that other people feel this way too. Thanks for the awards and comments!",mentalhealth
1552829913.0,"If you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts, this the wisdom I‚Äôve gathered since my suicide attempt a decade ago.","First and foremost you need some rest. I would say that 10/10 times when I have suicidal ideation it‚Äôs also when I am over tired or over worked.

Secondly there are people in your life that genuinely care enough to force you into help. I know it‚Äôs scary to reach out to them and admit that you are having a hard time alone but I whole heartedly recommend it. I would not be alive to type this if it weren‚Äôt for the wonderful people in my support network. One method my friend and I came up with is that I can kill myself, I just have to get his permission first. This gives me the benefit of having the ‚Äúoption‚Äù but also puts the social pressure on me to never do it. 

I know you might think no one gives a shit, but the same people who would be devastated if you died would probably prefer to help you out before it gets to that point. There is something socially validating about suicide in the brain of the suicidal. It feels easier than to admit you are having a hard time. You feel like people will take what you are going through seriously. But plain and simple you will not be around to enjoy that validation because you will be dead. And all the people who would have helped you will be asking what they could have done. Instead of leaving the people you love on this Earth with the trauma of dealing with your death, please reach out to them.

Lastly what you have gone through is not easy. You may feel exhausted, defeated or even angry at others. Self reflection might be productive but you are right to feel angry at how they treated you. What you do with that anger is your responsibility now and it seems like you are just letting it eat away at you. Maybe there is some way to can transfer that anger into productivity or artistic expression. Who knows?

You have real problems. They suck, you‚Äôre totally right to feel that way. You should feel no blame that shitty things happen to you. But these problems are still your responsibility. And there are people out there who can help. Again I would not be alive today if it wasn‚Äôt for the friend I mentioned above and a wonderful therapist who came in at the right time. You may not have luck the first few times; my first therapist sent me into a mental breakdown. But I promise you that you will find the right fit if you keep trying.

Focus on the problems that you can solve. I think about the serenity prayer they say in AA every day. ‚ÄúGrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference‚Äù. There are many issues in your life you may not have control over, but there are some that you do. Focus on those. Try to define them as precisely as possible. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúeverybody hates me‚Äù. Say ‚Äúeverybody hates me when I ______‚Äù. The first is a cry of defeat. The second gives you a concrete area of yourself that you can improve. I always tell my friend ‚Äúif you are going to hate yourself, at least be more specific‚Äù.

There is so much in life worth living for. A beautiful sunrise, your daughter‚Äôs graduation some day. Hell even if it‚Äôs just a new season of a tv show you love. The future is a mystery, and that‚Äôs a good thing. It means that everything is going to change. If things are good they are going to get worse. But that also means if things are bad they are going to get better. Take solace in that during the bad times and prepare yourself what things feel like they are going too well.

Don‚Äôt hesitate to dm me if there is anything I can help you with. We‚Äôre all on this crazy ride together.

God bless.

Thank you to everyone who shared their stories or sent their kind words. 

I hope that this post does not glamorize suicide attempts in any way. Yes I tried, but that doesn‚Äôt delegitimize the suffering of someone who hasn‚Äôt. Just because you haven‚Äôt attempted doesn‚Äôt make your situation any less valid or serious compared to anyone else‚Äôs. Remember my words above: a suicidal persons warped sense of reality tells them that suicide is a better option than reaching out for help. It is not. Ever.

Many of you have reached out to me in a PM and I thank you for reaching out to someone. I am always a friend in need to someone but I am not a professional. There are REAL professionals out there making a difference just waiting to be the change you need in your life. Remember the best thing you can do is reach out.

1610341323.0,"I like to think, whenever you ""pour one out"" for a friend or family member who has passed, in whatever afterlife you picture them in, a cup appears in front of them and they get to drink whatever you poured out for them.","I'll start by saying, I'm agnostic. And I dont really believe in absolutes. Because no one can see the future. No one really knows whats happening in someone else's head. And you can't predict who will pull through whatever, or who will be lost to whatever. And there's no way to really know what happens when we die. 

In all honesty, that thought brings me comfort. I dont think im a bad person. Sure, ive done shitty things, im human, like you (I assume). But this mindset is what has gotten me through some rough shit. 

2019 Is my worst year to date. August 24, a good friend who I really looked up to, committed suicide. I credit him to be a big part in preventing my own suicide. Then in November a great uncle and a high school classmate, both i was very fond of, passed within a couple days of each other. Then December 10, my grandma passed after a stroke the week prior. Her husband, my grandpa passed in May 2020. 

That was a bad time, as you can imagine. I had never lost anyone I was ever close to before then. My friends suicide being the big thing im still struggling with today. But whenever I have a beer, or some liquor, I pour one out in his/their name. 

I like to imagine my friend in Valhalla. As of all the afterlives that I know of, thats where he belongs. As he is a fucking legend. He lost his battle with depression, but he fought fucking hard. I still laugh and smile at the thought of him in any afterlife yelling at whoever is in charge because they don't understand the rules of whatever afterlife Pathfinder game he's running. 

And I like to think that wherever he, my grandparents, my old high school buddy, and my great uncle may be. When I pour one out, a beautiful mug full of that liquid is presented to them. 

Which that thought is made better by the fact that often times, im drinking really shitty cheap booze. And they look up from wherever they are and are just kinda ""what the fuck? You pour one out in mourning and im stuck with your shitty 1 dollar beer?"" 

I dont know, just a thought that may help someone in mourning. Hang in there, stranger. No matter how shitty life gets, it will always get better.  And despite the fact that life will get shitty again at some point, it WILL get better again.

1623829504.0,New job! Still homeless but I got a new job! Mental health is on the uptick!,"I am so fucking excited.   


Story time.   


Before Covid hit I was a leasing agent for a large Canadian REIT.  I was important, I was valued, I was paid very well. I had everything I wanted. I was fortunate enough to be sent to Calgary to launch one of the largest private student housing projects in Canadian history. Was a big big deal in the industry. Then Covid came along and decimated the Student housing industry. 50% of our clients were international and of the remaining 50% being domestic, only a small fraction of those were 'locally domestic' You can imagine what losing 90% of your paying clients can do for a project.  


I lost my job and came home defeated. My mental health suffered. My physical health suffered. My relationship suffered. I wasn't working, I wasn't a partner anymore. My girl left me in Dec.   


Things were hard. I was alone, I'm very much an introvert. The only people I talk to are people via Reddit or random women on dating apps. There's nobody I could call to come over and hang out with. Nobody I could call if I was having a dark moment. And there were many dark moments let me tell you.   


Winter blues is a thing. I'm a huge believer in that. I was living in a basement apartment that my ex and I shared before she left. I was so immobile emotionally and physically that for 5 months after she left I couldn't bring myself to removing anything she left behind. She took the cats, but the cat food sat in its dish for months. Her clothes still hung in the closet the way she left them. Every day was a dark dank lonely sad existence. I knew I needed a change. I had to change my outlook, my direction, my goals.   


I started talking to people on dating apps. I had no intention of seeing anyone. I just needed to talk to people again. That helped. I also started being more active on Reddit, that helped too. I like talking with people, I like giving advice. Small uptick in mental health after this.   
Then the sun started coming out. The grey dirty snow started going away. It was the end of April. Forced myself to go outside, even for a minute. Even for that very short walk to get milk. Instead of ordering it I went and got it. Small uptick in mental health after this.   
I got closure with my ex. Finally. Small uptick here.   


I needed something drastic though.   


So, voluntary homelessness. I left my apartment. I rented a room, and when that went to shit I started living out of my car. Waking up in the bush, next to a river, down by the ocean did wonders. Not caring or worrying about anything. Nothing at all, just being entirely selfish in my needs, my mental health. Huge uptick. I started smiling again. I started feeling better about everything. 

&#x200B;

Was going to spend the entire summer living outta my car. Then one random night I applied for a building manager job. Its become so much more than that.   


I was just given a job offer for a leasing agent role AND a building manager role. For a smaller REIT, but this position will require me to be very mobile. I could be driving 3hrs away to one of our buildings. I will never sit in an office. The company car is my office.   


Its going to be a couple weeks before I can afford an apartment, or I might just continue to live out of my car. Which may be tough because I'll also have a company car. So we'll see what happens there.   


But huge huge uptick. Motivation is high. Excitement is high. Self worth is high. I'm valued again. They were hugely impressed with my skill set, and its feels so damn good to be valued again.   


I wanted to share this because I've said to 100s of people on this very same sub that things can change, but you need to be the catalyst for that change. Nobody is going to come along and place change at your feet. You are responsible for everything that happens in your life, regardless of what has happened in your life. Wake up tomorrow, forge forward, make a small change in your life and allow it to snowball.   


Things are on an uptick now, but things dont get any easier. With this uptick comes a tremendous amount of responsibility. People are invested in me. This motivates me. I'll wake up tomorrow for my first day with a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm but will have to know and understand that a downtick can come at anytime. I'll deal with those when they come, I'm not going to worry about something that hasn't happened yet.   


Forward progress. Be the catalyst for change and personal growth. Have your pity party. Be sad. Have regret. But you gotta get over it, you gotta find closure and move on because the world will continue to spin without you. May aswell spin with it amirite?",mentalhealth
1612262165.0,I dont want to kill myself but I don't want to be alive either. It feels like I'm being forced to suffer and the only things that make me happy are just distractions from getting better.,"I fucking hate myself and everyone around me. I hate my mother, my dad and my brother. I hate my best friend. I hate my fucked up body and being alive is just morbid and disgusting. My mum is refusing to take proper care of my pets which I now have 5 of because she wanted more and will probably try to get more. I do the best I can but she still fucking overfeeds them so my two new kittens are going to be overweight and sick like the rest of my animals. 

If I show any sign of disagreement which is basically fucking impossible because she will literally say ""look how fat theyre getting isnt it cute"" and I cant help but look miserable or telling her that what shes doing is wrong. She will threaten to kick me out to move in with my dad which she has done multiple times before. I cant stay there because the whole house is covered in mould and I have breathing issues because Ive been smoking cigarettes, weed, heroin, pills, suboxone and tons of other crap since I was 12 years old. My breathing is so fucked I am constantly aware of my lungs and just breathing fresh air makes me feel so disgusted to be alive. I have an infection in my mouth and another in my sinus, which I basically have permanently because of the fucked up structure of my face.

Im not taking drugs anymore but I still smoke a cigarette every few days and I am so guilty because no matter how hard I seem to try, I cant even take care of myself. 

I live in fucking sydney where the house and rent prices are so fucked even if could find a trade or work I wouldnt be able to move out. The only person I had that understood and was there with me through all this shit was raped and murdered almost two years. He was my best fucking friend, the only person my age that I had been friends with in 6 years. My other best and only friend is addicted to fucking heroin and has aspergers so he just jumps to conclusions and gets mad at me if I show him any sort of emotion about things that are going on in my life, he just thinks im weak. I stopped seeing him because hes a horrible fucking influence. but I end up visiting him every week because i want social contact, but I just end up regretting it and leaving his house after an hour.

Ive recently been diagnosed with fucking epilepsy so thats fun. I have seizures when I dont get enough sleep, and I cant because my mum is fucking yelling or if im at my dads house he is up all night singing and working. Literally all night he sleeps from 6 am to 4 pm. So im constantly worried about having a siezure and I try so hard to get good sleep. So recently my sleeps been good enough that I dont think im at seizure risk, but still bad enough that my health is on a strong and steady decline. 

My brother doesnt talk to me, hes becoming an alcoholic. I mean hes been drinking everyday for the past year, but atleast hes stopped stealing off me and doesnt threaten to beat me up everytime I make eye contact with him anymore. 

I really dont want to kill myself but I have felt so bad my whole life and I cant seem to turn it around that I think if it keeps going it will be the only reasonable option. This is fucking bullshit. Why the fuck are the people around my happy. They are all fucking kidding themselves and need to just accept the fact there lives fucking suck so maybe they might actually do something to help themselves and inturn the people that care about them.

I could tell that my tics were scaring her so I told her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm safe, I just have Tourettes‚Äù.  Then I heard the dreaded word come out of my mouth....cunt.  It was clearly a tic, but Rachel‚Äôs reaction was to tell me I couldn‚Äôt talk to her that way. Her tone went from scared shitless to anger. That was when I knew that there is not going to be any help for me. At least not from a woman.  I realized then that I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to get reliable help and to just get off the phone. To be honest, it kinda ramped up my paranoia also. 

Before I got off the phone I calmed myself and quietly told her, ‚ÄúYOU are a mental health professional who has trained for this. When a person experiencing a mental health crisis calls you and uses a word YOU find offensive you need to remember that YOU‚ÄôRE feelings at that moment are minuscule compared to the pain the person on the other end is going through. Please think about this because you‚Äôre hurting some people more than you‚Äôre helping them‚Äù. 


I am so angry about this. I did everything right. I know from experience how broken our mental health system is, but this really hits a new low.  I took extensive notes because it seemed important and am really tempted to get that woman fired from her job for being so unprofessional, but frankly I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll get a woman on the line in HR and will again be dismissed because of sexism. From now on I will ask for and only speak with men when calling the Suicide Hotline(s).   

One thing I know for sure, I am not calling 911 for a trip to the psych ward anytime soon. If the mental health system is in this much crisis just over the phone imagine how bad it‚Äôs falling apart face to face. 

Thank god I‚Äôm already so used to self-isolating.

1565027989.0,I got an apology from my old psychiatrist,"When I was 13 (around the early 2000s) my parents got worried as I was making the transition from elementary school to middle school. They had me see a psychiatrist who did no testing or talking with me before writing me a prescription for some SSRIs. The dosage was very high and my parents weren't told to taper me on or off. 


I had intense sleepiness, trouble caring about things, trouble remembering my friends' names. I slept so deeply that I didn't even wake up to my body's signals to use the bathroom; I was a teenaged boy pissing his own bed. My grades plummeted and that made my parents simply insist on higher doses. The psychiatrist I was seeing wrote those prescriptions too, still never looked me in the eye. 


I knew something was wrong, but it was months before I could focus enough to tell my parents. Luckily they listened and I never had to take those pills again. But for the next 18 years I went through life blaming myself for not adjusting to a new school quickly enough or well enough. When I was old enough to make my own appointments, I spent hours and hours (and hundreds of dollars) getting evaluated for every possible mental illness. I even had blood tests. All the tests came back saying I was normal and healthy, but it still tugged at me. 


A few weeks ago I found the courage to find that psychiatrist and then I wrote him a letter asking for an apology. I was respectful, stating the facts of the matter first and then moving on to how it made me feel in the years afterward. I was clear that I only wanted an apology, but didn't want to smear his reputation or harm him. I told him that he could reply or he could not, and if he didn't reply I wouldn't bother him further. 


Today he found me via Facebook and apologized. The relief and the confirmation I felt was nearly overwhelming.

1561349181.0,Why isn‚Äôt there a such thing as an urgent care designed specifically for mental health emergencies?,"Why do emergency rooms exist for physical or extreme mental concerns but there is no such thing as a walk-in urgent mental health clinic?

I‚Äôve wondered this for years. I‚Äôve always had a panic disorder. During my first terrible panic attack at 21, I remember googling different mental health facilities in the area and limited info came up. I ended up calling the cops because I was afraid and felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, but knew it was psychological. The cops showed up and the only assistance they provided was suggesting that I sat in the back seat of their car. I felt ashamed sitting there, and as my panic dissipated, I just remember feeling hollow and empty. They couldn‚Äôt help me and unless I was truly a danger to myself or others, they weren‚Äôt going to commit me to any psych wards. So, they left and told me some ‚Äúmobile counselors‚Äù would be on the way.

Eventually, I went back home and sat alone for 3 hours, trying to relax. These ‚Äúmobile‚Äù counselors the cops said they would provide me with decided to give me a call and ask if I still wanted help. By that time I was fatigued, so I declined.

That‚Äôs when I came up with this question. At that moment I would‚Äôve loved to just walk into a place and talk to a counselor on-call. Not days or weeks of waiting to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist, nor being committed to a psych ward. Just real people with crises that they need help with.

Helplines, in my personal opinion, aren‚Äôt the same type of treatment. I‚Äôve only tried a couple though, so I‚Äôm not entirely certain on it. Though, in some cases, slight medication intervention might be necessary, and personally I prefer a face-to-face conversation.

After a breakup in late January, being a couch potato in the beginning, where I have been feeling like my lowest ever. Feeling sad, depressed, lonely and hurt like hell. While at the same time, going nuts from working from home, and not seeing anyone. Fuck this pandemic, right??! 

I decided, 13-14th Feb-ish to just go for a short walk, every day. Because‚Ä¶ fuck it what else is there to do.

I usually walked 20-30 minutes each day at first. Then the last 4-5 days I walked around hour. First it was just a nice break from being stuck indoor. But I have started feeling happier ever since I started walking. I don‚Äôt feel like giving up on life as much as I did not long ago. I even feel like smiling to strangers on my walk now... Yeah, I‚Äôm weird like that.

But today I walked 13km!! (8Miles, I think) my feet hurt, but I feel amazing, and kind of proud I did it. Also, I really need to get some wireless headphones‚Ä¶ wanted to chew that wire to pieces several times today. I still feel lonely, and missing my ex. But one day at a time, I guess.

1612694716.0,Tonight we sat and cried together. I forgot I had the power to help people even when I‚Äôm sad. Words aren‚Äôt always necessary.,"In my family we don‚Äôt talk much.

Tonight was a rough night. As per usual I was sat alone in my crying and melting into my mattress. When my mom came in I didn‚Äôt bother looking up at her and just growled a classic‚Äô go away‚Äô in response. 

She asked to borrow one of my books and I peeled myself off my bed to grab it. It was only when I went to tell her to leave did I actually bother to look at her. She looked like she had blown her noise a few times and her eyes were watery. This was maybe the second or third time in my entire life I‚Äôd seen this happen and I forgot how shellshocking it was to see your numbed parent like that. 

This lead to a short uncomfortable conversation of me asking if she was okay. We didn‚Äôt talk much. Instead I just asked her if she wanted to sit on the couch with me and watch a movie. I got her a blanket and some tissues. The whole movie we just sat there, at first crying and just holding hands by the end.

I still don‚Äôt know what happened to make her so sad. She knew better than to dig into my pile of mental issues. But when the movie was over she hugged me and said ‚Äúthank you. this is the happiest I‚Äôve been in a while. I needed this.‚Äù 

It really took me out of my own bullshit for a moment to realize I had done something good just by being there. And she had done the same for me in a way. I could tell we just both felt cared for by the end and in my house that goes a long way.

1600884732.0,Last month I attempted suicide for the 4th time. Today I was promoted a week into my new job. It does get better.,"I have struggled with mental illness my entire life. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as a child, depression at 14, ADHD at 16, and bipolar disorder at 20. The first time I seriously considered suicide was when I was 10. Needless to say, it‚Äôs been rough.

The pandemic hit me especially hard. In June I quit my job of 6 years due to the effect it was having on my mental health. I was supposed to work at a summer camp in July anyways, but the governor decided the day before I was supposed to start that residential camps would not be running this year. Due to me quitting my previous job I wasn‚Äôt eligible for unemployment, so I was no longer able to afford a therapist or my medication.

I found a new job in July but my mental health had declined to the point where I was completely unable to do it. It also involved driving to a different facility every day, which would cause me to vomit with anxiety before every shift. After having a panic attack over parking in Boston, I ghosted them and decided that this was the end for me. I couldn‚Äôt do something as simple as sit and stare at a pool for 8 hours, even if the alternative was an empty bank account and a rising self-hatred. How would I ever be able to function independently?

That night I attempted to hang myself. Obviously, it didn‚Äôt work, and I‚Äôm still here. This frustrated me; I felt like such a failure that I couldn‚Äôt even succeed in dying. I ended up relapsing with self harm, and I spent the weeks after that consuming any substance I could get my hands on to numb the pain, waiting for the courage to try again.

After the very much warranted disappointment from my parents, I ended up applying for an overnight warehouse job for an online retailer. From the rumors I‚Äôd heard I expected it to suck, but they were right, I needed a job.

They hired me, and I started last week. Turns out it doesn‚Äôt suck. And I don‚Äôt suck at the job either. Within three days they asked me to apply for a promotion, and today I got a fancy new vest, my shift differential was bumped up by $1.50, and I finally have some hope for the future. I also found out if I stay for a year they can help pay for my education, so for the first time in forever I have a long-term plan for my future. Best of all, I can afford to get help again.

I know I‚Äôm going to feel shitty again, but it‚Äôs going to get better again after that. I have trouble remembering times like these when I‚Äôm really going through it, but for the first time in years I feel capable. I feel like I can take it. I‚Äôm a hard worker and I‚Äôm no quitter, why would I give up on life like that?

I guess my point is that no matter how dark it seems, how hopeless it feels, or how incompetent you think you are, there‚Äôs always a chance for it to get better. I‚Äôm moreso making this post to look back on the next time I‚Äôm suicidal, but I‚Äôm hoping my message will help others a little.

For a brief moment in my life from ages 15 to the summer before I turned 17, I lived with my dad and his girlfriend. My dad was a passive, quiet guy that wasn't around much. He didn't want custody, but accepted to take me and my brother who was 12 at the time to live with him while my mom was in Europe taking care of someone. The whole situation was odd. This woman, let's call her C, had an 11 year old son and was not happy about two more kids being added onto her plate. My dad promised we were no trouble and that I was old enough not to need babysitting.

I was rebellious, like most 15 year olds. I was energetic, popular, and sporty. I had just broken up with my boyfriend, and I was just starting high school. Things are already horrible, and to add a stranger to the mix was ever more shitty. After we moved out and went back to live with my mother, I was never the same person. I told my therapist that I wanted to go back to that 15 year old girl again. I was so happy and fun. He asked me to describe when things changed, and this all came up...

This woman legit abused me, and nobody said anything. Nobody defended me, and I blamed myself. I thought I was troubled, that I was difficult, that it was my fault, that my dad didn't like me.

I bleached the lower part of my hair and colored it hot pink. When she found out, she dragged me to the bathroom and locked the door and stood in front of it. She didn't let me out until I cut the parts I had bleached. My hair went from almost above my bra to shoulder length. It looked horrible too. All the while, this large woman with shaved tattooed eyebrows stood behind me and yelled at me.

*Your father will blame me for this! What an idiot! I should just make you cut it all off! Either you do it or I'll do it for you!*

I clearly remember shaking and cutting my hair. She made me clean the bathroom, explain to my dad that I had made a mess of my hair and had to do this and apologize for it.

She convinced my dad not to let me go on a 3-day school trip because she thought I must be grounded for a month because I had stolen her wifi password. Her stupid 0000 wifi password. She said that I couldn't be trusted, and how could my dad let me go on this trip? So, I was grounded and not allowed to go - and I was the ONLY freshman not there.

She took my phone and only gave it back when I called my mom crying about it and she had to have a fight with dad from across the world. Finally, my dad decided my phone was out of the question.

The worst thing, aside from the hair, was when my friends and I decided to go to a party when I was 16. We got ready at our place, and were just leaving when she stopped us yelling and screaming.

*Why would you think it's ok to leave my house looking like a whore? get back here!*

And then she dragged me back to the house and pushed me to my room, legit attacked me and took off my clothes and made me wipe off my make-up and change into something else. My friends were frozen out of fear, I came out looking beaten (she didn't actually hit me, though) and miserable and crying. I just told them to just go - and we all ran out of that house. I was humiliated. I wanted to die. My friends didn't know what to do. One of them asked if she always treated me like that. ""What a bitch""

That night, she came into my room to let me know she only did that because she cares about my dad and what he thinks of her. Also that she doesn't want her son to see these things at his age!

She did that a lot. Randomly talking to me about what a great person she was and how wise she was. Once she sat me down to tell me I was acting out and that she knew I was a good girl deep down, but trying to fight her and that it was natural. She made me feel crazy and ungrateful. She would play the victim constantly. My dad was barely there, much like before, but when he was - he was yelling at me because she'd told him I was nothing but trouble.

She broke my spirit. I was too tired to fight her. I gave up fighting her, I just legit gave up. When I told these to my therapist, he said that abuse is exactly like this. They close a door on you, but don't teach you how to open another one... so you're just lost. I needed someone to love me, to pay attention, to tell me I was doing a good job getting straight A's in school. Instead, I got constant yelling and criticism and guilt.

I'm 26 years old now... and I've just realized what this monster has done to me. She's the reason my life is miserable now. I wasn't a bad kid. I wasn't a trouble maker. I was just a teenager, and this woman made it her mission to break me and she did. My dad never married her, and I have no idea what's happened to her. I've also never told my mom. I mean, she knew that I was having ""trouble"" but I never told her my side of the story.

I don't know how I'm going to overcome this, but I'm done feeling like the victim. I now know why I'm no longer happy and care-free and energetic. I know exactly when things changed. I'm the same person, I just had a door closed on my face and nobody showed me how to open another one. I'm gonna build one and walk through it now. Fuck you, C. I hope you get what you deserve. I'm sure she kept telling herself she was being ""responsible"" or that was her job - but all she had to do was NOT ruin some kid's life.

IMPORTANT EDIT: I just need to say this, since this is getting some reads... Please please please if you just don't feel good - that doesn't necessarily mean sad or angry, it could just be ""out of it"" - try and find the reason for it. I've tried for years. I've been in therapy since I was 17, and I started cutting myself. I used to think it was because of guys, or because of my parents' divorce, or because of x and y and... I only realized what this was all about when I told my therapist that the last time I was truly happy was when I was 15. He made me write about every single year of my life, and we went through it like a TV show and figured out what exactly happened. I didn't even think of this woman for much of my adult life. But now, everything's a lot clearer. So - just please talk to someone. Write. Writing is incredible, and it doesn't even cost anything. But if you write and talk to someone who knows what to look for - that's what matters. ",mentalhealth

1577557210.0,It's okay to be a male with mental health problems.,"Kind of an inflammatory title but it comes with a story and a bit of advice so buckle in.

Growing up I didnt have any problems with mental health. I was raised southern Baptist, worked on cars with my dad while still in diapers. When I could walk I learned home improvement, drywall, painting, ect. I was raised to be strong, protect my sisters and my mom. I was raised that men dont cry, men dont hurt. I grew up thinking that I had to be strong in all moments and never let down my guard. 

Fast forward to 2 years ago. I was driving home on the not so good side of town very very late at night when I saw a guy leaning in the window of a car. (Drug deals not uncommon out in the open) He turned away from the car and jerked violently before falling down onto the street. I slammed my car to a stop, threw up the brake and jumped out, not knowing what was happening. 

I always carry a firearm on me and had it on my side. I approached the male laying on the ground when the guys from the car he was leaning in opened their door. When they stood up the only thing I remember seeing was the barrel of their gun. Couldn't tell you what they looked like, what color the car was, hell even if it was a guy or a girl. I pulled my weapon when I saw this and we both paused for what felt like hours, days. I wasnt breathing. We just started at each other while I was aimed dead in that person's chest. 

I didnt pull the trigger.

The person jumped back in their car and sped off after what seemed like an eternity and I holstered my weapon and ran to the guy in the street. He was shot in the lower left of his back, blood pumping out of a small circle wound. Holding pressusre on it with one hand and trying to dial 911 with the other I tried to stop and much bleeding as possible. After hanging up with 911 the wait began. 

I took my jacked off and laid it under him. (With it being cold out and him losing blood you want to keep his core as warm as possible. Help arrived almost exactly 1 hour later. My hand had frozen, literally frozen to this mans skin in a frozen seal of blood. 

Greg was his first name and he made a full recovery.

I moved on from that day different. Over the course of the next year I would have night terrors of the image of that gun, the blood pumping out of his skin, being alone with him desperately trying to keep him alive. I couldn't be in public with out my heart racing and having to leave. I didnt trust new people I was meeting. I was scared to be alone at any times. It came to a head when I tried to end everything. 

With out going into it to much I didnt. I went straight to family for help and explained everything. My mom took me in, I found a therapist that I enjoyed and got put on a medication to calm the terrors. The first time I talked to the therapist I cried. I cried and cried for the first time in my life. Cried like a baby and let all the manly machismo go. I was vulnerable and she held me through it. She understood and didnt judge. She saved me.

One year of therapy later I have a totally different outlook on mental health. After reading through this sub I figured this story could help someone. It is okay for men to hurt. It doesnt make you less of a man to be struggling with something. It is okay to break down and not have the solutions. 

Please, if you are someone who thinks you will be judged negatively for having ""something wrong"" or being broken in some way, there is help. I am forever grateful I found help when I did.

Sorry if the story is kinda rushed or mistyped, kinda a hard subject to bring up.

1623329096.0,I'm sick of therapists using CBT where it isn't helpful,"I'm getting really sick of people who are all about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Positive Psychology and think having a positive attitude is the end all be all of mental health treatment. There are many people who benefit from this type of therapy, don't get me wrong, but the people who are suffering most often see it as writing them off. If you are deep in poverty, in an abusive relationship, jobless, homeless, or preoccupied with messages from voices you hear, these methods do not work. Therapists need to take this into account when working with people who fit into these categories, but also initially with all patients. There should be an understanding that people aren't very open at first in therapy in general and could have any of these things going on and not tell you. Simply saying you need to change your thoughts doesn't work. People may be in situations where their thoughts are about real problems they need to face every day. I understand trying to make it easier for that person and that is what you think you're doing, but really you are just making your job easier. You, as a therapist, would be much better off starting with asking what kind of therapy someone is looking for and describing the different forms if necessary. Different forms fit different people and I'm sick of CBT being the gold standard. 

It really makes my blood boil when I hear someone say their therapist doesn't listen, and most of the time it's because they are trying to use CBT and Positive Psychology where they don't belong. Sometimes life really is hard for that person, and trying to get them to think differently about it is an exercise in futility. People are often quietly in crisis, and I see these approaches as inherently dismissive of this fact.

When I said I brought a list, he said he'd rather I tell him about it myself. Fair enough, I tried to. He interrupted me before I could get into the second diagnosis on my list, telling me not to use words like ""depersonalisation"" for myself. Those words are for people that are really sick, not people like me. 

He kept asking me what my boyfriend does and if he's mentally stable, if I'm happy with him. The appointment was supposed to last an hour, we were done in 15 minutes because he didn't ask me anything about me. He dismissed everything I said I was experiencing, he said I was making myself more sick than I actually was. He said I was a really sensitive, frail person and I shouldn't use medical terms to describe my symptoms. 

He ended the appointment with a well-loved classic, I need to go on runs, it works just as well as an anti-depressant! I have chronic back issues and am not supposed to run. I told him that and got the ""stop making yourself more sick than you are, you're young and healthy"" speech again.

I'm so exhausted, that was such a terrible appointment and I feel so stupid now. I'll never go there again.

Edit: thank you all so much for your kind words, for the insight on your own experiences and your different views on this! I was really upset after my appointment but it really helped to be heard by so many people!",mentalhealth
1572450145.0,"My depression is not an ""aesthetic"". It's not cute to be a ""sad boy/sad girl"".","I'm sick and tired of seeing people treat depression and mental illness like it's some cutesy fashion accessory. Going ""uwu I'm so sad all the time look at me I'm a sad boy aren't I dreamy and mysterious"" takes all of the gravity out of how it feels to be depressed. These people probably have no clue what it feels like to fight the urge to cut your arms and legs clean open, how it feels to have to smile at people and play the happy person when you're in constant agony, because you can't tell them how you really feel without being a ""downer"" or being told to ""chill out"". I would love to chill out. I would love to not be a downer, I would love not to drag the people I know down with me when I'm not doing well, I would love to have a reason to live that isn't ""live long enough to see this band come to town in 5 months"".

Mental illness isn't pretty. Mental illness isn't an aesthetic choice. Being depressed doesn't make you cute or quirky or unique. It hurts you, it tears you limb from limb on the inside, and thanks to people that treat it like a cutesy instagram aesthetic, very few take it seriously.",mentalhealth

This is how ive felt for as long as i can remember. The times when it didn't feel this way in my life have been as few and far between as sunshine on a cloudy day.

I feel fucked up somehow, like this isn't what human life is supposed to feel like. I can't imagine why human beings would exist to feel this way. It feels criminal.

The only times that I feel OK are when I'm stoned, like right now. And - rarely- when very comfortable with friends in a loving home environment. I never felt like this once while I was living with my parents.

I gave up a lot to feel better, I even quit my job and left everything behind on a spiritual journey, and yet after a lot of (enjoyable) adventures I still feel the same. Like life is just a movie playing in front of my eyes, as though a dream which I have no will over. I never felt in control of my life, really. I have always been along for the ride of whatever my impulses tell me. Sometimes they boss me in positive directions and sometimes negative but at the end of the day I still feel like I'm only holding on to the reins of my life which is living itself. I don't stand up for myself when verbally attacked, I just go silent and dumb. I've never been able to release myself completely to romantic love, just half way, never committing to anything that concrete, just like I've lived my life.

I have always been of strong character and hard working, people who know me would say I'm life and soul, funny, intelligent and strong. Recently though I've found myself slipping into a routine of staying up late and sleeping all day and being lazy. I cocoon myself in my duvet and wrap a pillow around my head and try to sleep as long as possible. I can wake momentarily and remember my dreams quite vividly (they are always enjoyable happy dreams) I can then just remember the dream and slip back into them. 

It's like I'm addicted to my dreams and as soon as I wake I try and try to enter back into that world. Sometimes I'm successful but after 12 hours sadly I am in the real world. 

I am in danger of losing my job because of this now which worries me even more. It's quite apparent that I must be depressed. I have so much to be grateful for but it appears the big D has taken over my life. Can I regain my normal life?

1558639977.0,"High schools need therapists and real resources for suicidal students, not just non-suicide contracts","First time posting here, please don‚Äôt mind the rambly-ness of this. Today I was thinking about something that happened years ago that made me realize schools don‚Äôt do much about suicidal students. 

When I was in high school I was severely depressed and going through a really difficult time in my life due to my parents divorce, particularly after being sent to live with my neglectful and abusive dad. I was self harming, battling an eating disorder, and was barely sleeping at night. I was absolutely struggling pretty clearly on the outside. I had a teacher tease me for looking so miserable at school every day and I got in trouble for being inattentive or dozing off in classes among my high-achieving peers. It was a rough time. 

I remember changing a password to something I accessed at school to iwannadie. It must have been flagged because I was sent to my guidance counselor, who really only ever gave people advice and help with applying to college, and she basically got me in trouble and threatened to tell my parents, and made me sign a contract that I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself. It totally cured me of all depression and I was never suicidal again! /s

Anyway, it upsets me that they didn‚Äôt do anything more about this. They didn‚Äôt mention it to my parents or anyone else, they never followed up again, and didn‚Äôt have a therapist or a professional to refer me to, in school or out. 

Schools need to have a resource for students. I was so vulnerable and depressed and I was shamed for it rather than helped. Guidance counselors don‚Äôt really have time for this, which is understandable, but they MUST have someone else there to support students during tough times if that‚Äôs the case.",mentalhealth

They were born in India, but I was born here in the United States. I‚Äôve lived here in the Southeast for my whole life. I‚Äôve always faced so much racism. I‚Äôve been called a terrorist for my skin color more times than I can remember. 

The media so often uses us as the butt of jokes (looking at you Disney Channel) and even some politicians do too. Joe Biden made a joke about Indians being gas station owners (my parents are lawyers with American accents). Nobody cares though. I‚Äôm just expected to suck it up. 

I tried so hard to look at the bright side. To look at how much opportunity and financial success this country has provided, and that is something I will always be very grateful for. I tried so hard to love this nation, but I just can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been told to ‚Äúgo home‚Äù by some people. Despite being born here and living here my whole life, I‚Äôll never be seen as a true American. 

Despite that I just can‚Äôt stand it any more. It‚Äôs not the racism so much, but the indifference and invalidation. That‚Äôs the real depressive thing. 

Anyway, this isn‚Äôt to say that all Americans are like this. I‚Äôve met plenty of fantastic ones who understand and sympathize, but there are just too many of the bad apples in this country for me to want to stay. 

I was lucky enough to intern in, and get a full time job in London. I‚Äôm so ecstatic to move there. The fact that I‚Äôm ethnically Indian won‚Äôt be my defining factor there like it is here. At least there I‚Äôll be ‚Äúthe American‚Äù and not ‚Äúthe Indian.‚Äù

So if I have kids, they‚Äôll grow up in a country where their skin color isn‚Äôt their defining factor.

1620221048.0,Best friend took her own life: the aftermath and everything else,"November 2020 my best friend(17F) committed suicide. It was honestly one of the most traumatic things I've ever had to go through, and my boyfriend(18M) and I also broke up about a week after her death. (Just to clarify, he didn't break up with me because he didn't want to deal with me going through my best friend's suicide. Our breakup was a long time coming, it just unfortunately happened at a really bad time).

November through January was the most difficult time of my life. I struggled so so much. I think I had so much trauma from that time, that I literally cannot remember a single thing from those two and a half months. I just remember this constant feeling of numbness and having a breakdown every couple of days. I missed my ex-boyfriend and I missed my best friend so so much. Somehow I've lost my two best friends, the two most important people in my life only eight days apart. It was awful. 

I'm doing much much better now. I've made new friends, I've kissed new boys, I'm going to social events with my friends (Covid is currently under control in my country, don't worry xx). I've realized that breaking up with my now ex-boyfriend was one of the best things I've EVER done for myself. Please don't get me wrong, he's a phenomenal person with a beautiful heart. I still have so much love for him, but we weren't meant to be together in the long run, and I've realized that now. Our relationship became toxic, not because either of us were toxic individuals, but because we weren't good for each other anymore. 

As for my best friend... Zara my beautiful beautiful angel. I miss you every day, but I know how much pain you were in. This world didn't deserve you, sunflower-child. I still feel you everywhere around me. I feel you when the sun hits my back when I'm laughing with my friends at school, I feel you when I'm making out with younger boys on golf courses and I know you would've approved. I feel you around me when I'm drinking beers with my boys and dancing with my girls.  You're always around, I know it!

I miss you so much, but I know you're in a place where you're happy, and that you're finally at a place where you don't have pain and where you can truly be yourself. I love you, you selfless and kind person.


To the people who read this post, I truly hope that you are doing well. I wish you the best. I just really needed to write my feelings out and hit post. To send it into the universe. Please remember that things do get better ‚ô°

1692390332.0,I got sexually assaulted 2 hours ago and my parents blame me for it [F19],"On a 1-hour ride in a crowded bus an older man kept touching my breast and offering me money after I repeatedly refused and raised my voice and tried to protect myself. The bus was so crowded I couldn't get away from him. Everyone noticed and did NOTHING said NOTHING. Other older man started watching and seemed entertained. I live in a third world country. After the man got off the bus some people started talking that it was very disturbing what he did  but NO ONE did NOTHING to stop it.

I got home crying and told my parents what happened. They blame me and tell me that it's because of the way I dressed. That I deserved it for not dressing appropriately. That it was my fault. I was dressed In a short large dress with no cleavege (I'm petite) and it's not even a dress, the skirt part is actually shorts.

I was trying to explain how miserable I am but they kept interrupting me, shouting ""you should have done that, that"". I told them about another situations that happened 4 years ago where I was also sexually assaulted in public. But that time I was dressed with a lot of clothes. They told me my fault that time was that I didn't scream or say anything. So again it's my fault. 

!!!!! They said that it's my fault that he thought I was a hooker (this hurts SO much my heart aches)

It's my fault for what happened today implying that I deserve it.

There are no words to describe how I am feeling right now. I am a very sensitive person in general and a lot of things affect me deeply.

I am crying my heart out right now in the corner of a dark room praying for someone in this world who would come right now to give me a hug and actually listen to me and understand me. I want to overcome this (I have 1 week until uni starts, idk how I'm gonna do that) but at the same time I cannot believe these are MY parents and this is what they told me and think of me. 

I am so traumatized and crying incontrollably right now that I feel like I'm gonna explode. I feel betrayed and unprotected. 

*The point for this post is that I DO NOT want to go mentally insane from everything that happened. I do not want to wake up one day in the mental hospital. My mental state is very shaky right now. Please help me , I don't know how but please help me. I don't want to lose my health*

I'm a 20-year-old woman from Newcastle, UK, and I'm reaching out for help. When I was 16, I moved to the UK with my mother from Poland, and since then, life has been a constant struggle.  
  
My father left us when I was young, and I haven't had any contact with him for years. My mother's severe mood swings resemble extreme bipolar episodes, but she refuses to seek any help, making my life even harder.  
  
Last year, I was prescribed Roaccutane for my acne, and things took a turn for the worse. Due to COVID, my doctor increased my dose without necessary blood tests, and I became extremely ill. My mother's refusal to pay for my treatment made things worse, and I was suicidal, but I managed to hang on.  
  
Yesterday, my mother had her worst episode yet. While drunk, she threatened me and got very close. Terrified for my safety, I locked the door behind her when she went outside to smoke. Shockingly, she set the garden on fire, knowing it would spread to the house and harm me.  
  
I called the police, and my mother is now in custody. I'm completely alone, with no support, money, or idea of how to move forward. I can't work or study because of my condition.

1564822163.0,‚ÄúMaybe I should suicide myself?‚Äù,"Those are the words of my 9 year old son. Words he spoke the other day because he misses his 17 year old cousin who died by suicide 16 months ago. He wants to see her. Words I now carry with me every moment of every day. 

I was there that morning. I arrived right after the police. It was like a scene in a movie. Emergency lights flashed from every direction. I left my car in the middle of the road, door open, pushed past all the police in the street, and ran into the house. 

Looking back on that day I can see myself as if I was watching from above. My sister and her husband were inconsolable.  Police everywhere. The screams, and tears. All the phone calls. It‚Äôs such a blur. But what is clear are the moments I was able to sit with her before she was taken away. The quiet in her room was deafening. I wanted it all to stop. I wanted to turn back the clock. To have one more chance. As I sat there the realization hit me like wave. Everything had changed. I couldn‚Äôt stop it. Nothing would ever be the same again. My niece... she was gone. 

It‚Äôs been sixteen months and no one has ‚Äúmoved on‚Äù.  It‚Äôs something we carry with us every day. It‚Äôs part of all of us. That loss, the grief, the anger and disbelief. It makes every step harder to make and every breath harder to take. 

My niece was in pain. Blinding pain. I sat on the front steps that morning and read the note she left. 10 pages of writing as the drugs took effect. She was more afraid of waking up then dying. Those were her exact words!  She was only two months shy of 18, yet she couldn‚Äôt see the light her future held. Any hope she had gathered over time had slipped through her fingers. She couldn‚Äôt hold on any longer. 

I‚Äôm grateful that her pain has stopped but I wish she could have seen or felt the love she was leaving behind. The devastation that has ripped through our family is the result of the tremendous love we all felt for her.  She was our light. She brought so much joy to us all. Yet she struggled to feel any herself. 

Life will never be the same. People tell you that things will get better in time. A big part of me wants to scream that I don‚Äôt want everything to be ok because it‚Äôs not.  We‚Äôre not and never will be. We‚Äôre all a mess. My kids still struggle every day.  She was a regular part of their life. She loved them unconditionally and them her. How do you explain why this disease could take her away and why we couldn‚Äôt help her.  They are too young to have to deal with anxiety and depression, and loss. 

What I wouldn‚Äôt give for another chance to reach her. Knowing the pain she was in crushed my soul. She had the most beautiful heart. If only she could have felt how loved she was. 

If you are struggling with depression or thinking about suicide, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE reach out for help. You are not alone. You deserve to feel love and happiness. You might not feel it or see it right now but there are people who care, who see your worth, who understand your pain, and want to help.  You can even confidentially call or text counselors who can help. I posted the link below.

1686266074.0,am i in the wrong for reporting a consensual sexual encounter?,"so basically i (21f) was baker acted (for those who don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs a mandatory 72 hour hospital stay for mental health) after, in my case, a suicide attempt. the hospital brought me to the psych ward, and i was put on suicide watch overnight there at 10pm. the guy (27m) who was the one watching me immediately started flirting, making super sexual comments, asking to see my body, etc. he was hot and i was in such a dark place so obviously i played along. like when he came in i was crying and saying how worthless i felt, etc. anyways, he started saying how much he wanted to have sex with me and how much he wanted to kiss me, so eventually he told me that if i went into the bathroom he would ‚Äúhave to follow me‚Äù since that was part of the suicide watch. in the bathroom we made out, and did other things, but not actual sex. this went on basically all night (10pm-7am), having sexual conversations, making out, talking about how we would meet up when i got out (he would get me pregnant and we would run away together), he got my phone number, etc. he gave me a fake name, and i later found out that he was married with a child. 

it was all consensual in the moment, like i never told him no, but thinking back on it i feel like he took advantage of the mental state i was in, and his position of power to get what he wanted. it feels like when a police officer gets with someone they arrested. 

all that to say, i feel like i did the wrong thing. i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm a victim. i feel like i ruined this man‚Äôs life over something that i said yes to.

one of the other patients just called me and said he kept getting into fights today because the nurses kept talking about me and saying that i‚Äôm a slut and a whore and would fuck anyone who walked and that i was lying about it.

1619849331.0,I am one day free of abusive relationships,"So I (27M) moved house yesterday away from my ex girlfriend who was emotionally abusive and controlling since we first started dating 9 years ago and only recently did I realise how bad she actually was. 

We broke up about 6 months ago and have been living together as housemates till now and after finally moving out my sense of relief is so enormous I just want to cry. Even as housemates she was still super controlling and never gave me privacy or respect, she'd burst into my room at random moments without knocking, no matter what I was doing she would sit on my bed uninvited and talk for ages about herself to demand my attention and I was called rude if my replies weren't what she wanted. She'd never let me have a say or input about anything that went into the house, it was all just her decisions and that was final. 

I've just moved into a share house which I was terrified about since I've never lived with anyone else before and my new housemates are really lovely and welcoming and it actually feels like my place aswell. it's a weird feeling not having anyone to ""answer"" to any more but I guess it's the feeling of actual freedom! 

After narcissistic parents who were controlling and emotionally abusive too Its been a weird rough time getting to this point but my healing begins today.

I worry and stress about things that have happened, will happen, might happen, might not happen, or surely won‚Äôt happen.  My day is consumed with these thoughts to the point where I get a migraine, cry it out, hold it in, get mad.... I‚Äôve been on anxiety medication... all of them, off and on for years.  At the point now where I‚Äôm too anxious to take anxiety medication because I‚Äôm anxious to get side effects.  Backwards I know...  I‚Äôve seen a therapist before but not for awhile.  I always felt like I was bothering them.

But I feel strange for being like this because I am 33, I‚Äôm married, have three kids, a house, a job, a nice large family, lots of friends and cousins and a dog etc and there‚Äôs no issues... but most days I end my day thinking ‚ÄúI feel like if I just were to die, I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with these feelings anymore, and I‚Äôd be free.‚Äù And that‚Äôs in regards to my irrational worry and negative thoughts that I alone put in my head.  But I don‚Äôt want to die.  I‚Äôm afraid of dying actually.  

I‚Äôve been fine my entire life except for when I had my second son 11 years ago.  He was born with club foot.  I spent all my maternity leave going to Children‚Äôs hospital for castings, surgery, etc. He had an MRI last year and got orthopedics.  He‚Äôs fine and happy and healthy.  But since he was born I changed and I‚Äôve developed panic attacks, anxiety, depression, IBS that put me in the ER 4 times, ulcers.  I worry that bad things will happen to me or my kids non stop.  I can‚Äôt stop the play button.  

So yes this is kind of venting but I‚Äôm at a loss and I try not to talk about this with anything because I feel like I‚Äôm being too whiny and dramatic.  Everyone‚Äôs response is always your son is fine now, basically get over it.  But I‚Äôve always felt like I had some sort of PTSD (I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs actually what it would be) after my sons situation because I‚Äôve never gotten over what he went through and what I went through mentally and financially because of it.

I was all set to live a nice life overseas but all went down hill in a matter on months. Since then, I've been feeling as if I'm empty inside and lost all hope. At them time, it seemed that life wasn't worth living as everything I had worked hard for, went in vain. Since childhood I made sure to make my body my number one priority so I never drank alcohol or did drugs. But as things went bad, I started taking percs and lean to ease the pain. Some time ago, I took one too many pills and was overdosing. My friends broke into my room and found me having a seizure. I was rushed to the E. R. 
I'm lucky to be here and will never touch drugs again. I went toy first therapy session last week and I have to tell you it was a great experience opening up and letting my feelings be heard.Felt really light after that. Just want to let you know that, if things are bad right now, you gotta stay and see how things turn out. They may turn out pretty good and it's crazy how the right people walk into your life at the right time.

1621566161.0,Everyone cares so much about mental health until it comes to parts that aren't romanticized.,"I'm so tired of this. I'm mainly speaking from experience. I know so many people that advocate for mental health but in reality they are just doing that to make themselves look good like they don't actually care. Those same people complain about their friends that are being ""too negative"" , those same people brag about dropping certain friends because they spend too much time alone and¬† never want to hang out, those are the same people that are embarrassed to be seen with their friend in public because they have self harm scars and are wearing short sleeves. They literally think that depression is just being sad and anxiety is like just being nervous about an exam. They have this version in their heads of what mental illness is that's so far from what it actually is. They kind of glamorize it in a way but there is nothing glamorous about having a mental illness. 

Again I'm just speaking from experience but i know so many people like this and it really pisses me off, they advocate so much for mental health yet they know nothing about it. They don't even try to empathize or provide some support instead they actually want nothing to do with a mentally ill person, they judged you and they just try to push toxic positivity onto you. I recently got diagnosed with depression, general anxiety disorder and CPTSD. I've had friends call me gross because at one point my depression got so bad that I didn't showed in 4 days, I've had friends that called me dramatic when I almost had a panic attack in public, I've had friends that got angry at me for not wanting to watch a movie because certain scenes triggers my PTSD, I've had friends that judged for having suicidal thoughts and they told me that ""I should think happy thoughts"" or ""You shouldn't be so negative all the time"" or ""You should be grateful because your life isn't as bad as others"". 

Those are the same people that are apart of all the mental health groups/clubs at my school and they post all over their social media for mental health awareness month and suicide prevention month but in reality they don't care about any of that. This person that I know that advocates so much for mental health once gave me a whole lecture because they thought that I was self diagnosing  (this was before I was actually diagrams with anything) and all I did was tell them that my mental health has been really bad and that I've been feeling depressed and struggled with anxiety for a really long time. I had to explain to them that you can still struggle with your mental health even if you're not diagnosed with any mental illness and they told me that I can't say that I'm feeling depressed without actually being diagnosed with depression. I'm sorry for the rant, I'm just so tired of all these hypocrites that pretend to care just so that they could look good and feel better about better about themselves.",mentalhealth

I wrote this when I had a revelation about myself. I knew I've been depressed my whole life. I knew I had severe anxiety and I hated myself more than words can explain. But I thought it was completely my fault - that I was a broken person. I thought I would never heal. I thought nobody would ever understand me. I just recently realized that my childhood abuse has completely shaped who I am as an adult. I never before made the connection between my childhood abuse and who I am today. It wasn't simply just a ""chemical imbalance; end of story"". You may not have experienced anything even remotely similar to what I have, but I hope after reading this some of you will start thinking and start seeing connections to your inner abused child that is still suffering from what happened to you in the past.
(Please google CPTSD if you haven't already heard of it.)

.
.

I'm gonna vent about this because I know I'm not the only one. This is something that I just recently realized and it takes a lot of weight off my shoulders to finally know why I am the way I am. This was really an eye opener for me. This is my story. *TW*

The worst part about child abuse is for a lot of us, we are too young to understand that we're even being abused. Especially in terms of emotional abuse. We don't know any different. We grew up being treated like this, and we know something doesn't feel right, but we decide it must be a problem with us. ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" 
Thankfully I did know that the physical abuse I was receiving was not okay, but honestly it took me 24 years to fully realize that I was emotionally abused as a child. 24 YEARS.

I was emotionally and physically abused by my parents and other family members (mostly my mother) starting as a very very young child, possibly infant. Of course as a child you are incapable of understanding that you are not to blame. Because of this, I believed that I was broken, horrible, and stupid. I thought something was wrong with me. Why else would my parents not love me? In my own eyes I had to be at fault. Something was wrong with me. Even as a preschooler and kindergartener I have memories of thinking ""why do I have to be me?"" and ""what's wrong with me?"". My self esteem was non-existent. 

I remember going to my pediatric doctor due to a skin infection I had as a kindergartener. I had to see this doctor weekly, and because she was so kind to me (as a doctor should be, or any adult honestly) I started to see her as a parent figure. She made me feel loved and safe when my own mother did not. I remember I brought her a picture of me that we got from school picture day. She told my parents that I must have asperger's because of how socially awkward I was and how I acting around her (the doctor.) This later proved to be false, but again added to my feeling that I was broken and bad. We stopped seeing that doctor and my parents were furious at me. Why was it not clear to this doctor that I was insecurely attached?

My self esteem and hatred towards myself only got worse as time went on, and by 4th grade I was having full on almost passing out panic attacks. Started as hypochondria, but quickly became social anxiety. I could NOT function in school because I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin. Nobody wanted to be my friend. Nobody cared about me. The teachers HATED me. And then at home, nobody loved me. When people would look at me I wanted to just disappear. I made myself believe that I was incapable of making friends or being likable which in turn basically made me be unlikable. Ironic. Nobody wanted to be around me because my anxiety made me very awkward. I viewed myself as lesser than everyone else which would follow me into adulthood. Eventually I could not talk in front of the class. If I even knew I had to say a single word in front of the class or have everyone look at me I would literally run out of the room. Complete full on flight mode. Instead of being diagnosed with ANXIETY, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I couldn't focus because I was probably always disassociating. School was not the most important thing in my mind because at both at home and at school I was trying to survive. Why on earth would school be the first thing on my mind? 

Of course I fell behind in school and struggled to keep up with assignments which in turn made me feel even more stupid. When they had psychologists coming in to my classroom to study me, it only worsened my hatred towards myself. ""They're only watching me and studying me because there's something wrong with me."" I started seeing the school psychologist, therapist and social worker weekly. I was put into remedial classes and on an IEP. I was placed in some classes with children with severe behavioral and intellectual disabilities. I was forced to take IQ tests. In 6th grade I was literally forced to STACK BLOCKS while a psychologist watched. I'll never forget seeing the notes the psychologist wrote after that. ""Lots of nervous laughter."" No shit. I'm 12 and you're having me stack 5 blocks in a specific pattern. This is after they found out I had an average IQ, mind you. Everything that they did, whether they were trying to help or not, made me feel worse about myself. ""Why can't I be like the regular kids?"" is all that went through my brain. Every single thing that happened to me only solidified the belief in my head that something was wrong with me.

I was embarrassed of my own existence.

When I'd go home and try to explain that I would shake and be so scared that I couldn't even think straight in school my parents would just scream at me. I remember getting punched in the stomach and told to suck it up after just trying to explain what was going on. I had no one to turn to. 

By 7th grade I could not go to school. If I knew I'd have to work with other students or even be looked at in front of the class I would skip school. And honestly, it wasn't that school itself was a problem. I liked school itself. I couldn't function with my low self esteem and hatred towards myself. I constantly felt singled out. I felt bad that other people even had to look at me. I was too young to put this into words, and all I was able to say to anyone about what was going on was that talking in front of the class makes me scared and shakey. 

After I started getting in trouble for missing so much school (after the school social worker and principal drove to my house to talk to my parents and do a wellness check on my family), I went with extreme measures. Even running away from home and hiding which ended up with the police looking for me. All because I didn't want to have to panic. I tried to explain my anxiety in the best way a child can without even understanding what anxiety is. I was treated like a delinquent child instead.
Ended up in court after missing hundreds of days of school and had to do weeks of community service. AT 12 YEARS OLD.

I was showing so many signs of an abused child and I had definitely brought up my family physical abuse multiple times to adults at school and nobody heard me. Nobody. I was not a delinquent. I was suffering so noticeably yet somehow nobody noticed. 

By high school I refused to wear my glasses so I wouldn't have to see people looking at me in the hallway. I was still in remedial classes all those years later, which were mostly for kids with behavioral issues.  Kids that would kick, fight, scream, do drugs, you name it - this was not me at all.  I think I gave up trying to speak out because I tried so many times and I couldn't get anyone to hear me. I ended up dropping out of high school.

Fast forward to three years ago when I was going to pursue my dream of studying and then hopefully teaching abroad in Japan. Saved up for three years for my student visa and relearned everything from the ground up to get my GED. Did both things, got accepted and started my Japanese school in Tokyo. Never in my life had I been so proud of myself. I didn't even believe I was capable of accomplishing anything in my life. The moment that plane landed I cried my first ever happy tears.

Two weeks into language school, we were going around the table of probably 20 other students learning verbs at a very fast pace. I remember time slowing down while I was waiting for it to be my turn, then I blacked out. When I came to I ran out of the classroom. I left school and walked around Tokyo sobbing. I had gotten that far and somehow completely forgot how bad my self esteem and anxiety are. My dreams completely clouded out the truth. I knew I couldn't continue with school so I dropped out, then impulsively blew all of my tuition money that I saved for years on bullshit. After coming home I hit rock bottom and was hospitalized. Once again, the belief that I was broken was renewed in my mind.

At the hospital I was told ""you're not severe enough for inpatient treatment"". The doctor spent a total of maybe 4 minutes with me. Asked me a couple questions, checked me for head injuries, and left. I went to the hospital because I knew that if I went back home I was going to end my life. I was so used to stuffing my emotions down into myself at this point in my life that even if I was on the edge of ending it all - I looked calm. I even explained to them this. After waiting 6 hours after seeing the doctor, they sent me to a place thats only purpose was to keep you from harming yourself. Great, but when I went back home I learned nothing. No coping skills, didn't talk to a single mental health professional, nothing. I was back at square one. I reached out for help for the first time as an adult and was again, failed.

Inside my head was still the once tiny little girl wondering, ""what is wrong with me?""

Memories of my childhood were again, flashing back. I sat in my room for months. I couldn't leave the house. I had no desire to exist. I ripped up every baby photo I had with my mother in them. I honestly thought I wouldn't live another year. I was going to end up killing myself. I lost all of my hope.

Now, a couple years after that I'm finally now just getting the real help I need. I had to be the one to keep reaching out. It was very hard, but I am so glad I did. I had to keep picking myself back up, again and again; If I hadn't I would not be alive. I'm so glad that I chose to fight for my life. I searched for a long time for a good psychiatrist and therapist. I finally found someone who heard me. I have even been able to forgive people who abused me. Of course I still and always will have scars, but now I am able to cope with them. 
I now know I am not broken. I am a survivor and I have been and was just trying to survive. People are now shocked when I tell them I have ""social anxiety."" Eventually I will go back to Japan when I am actually ready. 

Learning about CPTSD and realizing WHY I am the way I am has been extremely important to me. Just like I'm finally connecting the dots. I'm finally starting to love myself. The little girl that once felt so unloved is finally healing. 

I encourage all of you to learn how your trauma affects you, and know that you can also heal from it. üíï I hope someone out there will read this and feel like there is hope. I truly hope this inspired someone out there that is in an awful place like I once was. Do not give up on yourself.

Please remember: You're not broken. You're surviving.

1614865391.0,My experience in a psych ward,"Last Saturday, February 27th, was the one year anniversary of my ex cheating on me, I had really bad thoughts about harming her, like if I could end her life all my problems would be fixed. See, she was abusive to me and her cheating on me broke me mentally and sent me into a downward spiral that I thought was bipolar disorder. 

I had spoken with both my family doctor and a psychiatrist, and they both agreed that it seemed to be type 2 bipolar disorder. So, I started taking medicine for it. Now, let's jump back to last Saturday.

I realized these thoughts I were having were dangerous and that I needed serious help immediately, so I told my parents to take me to the hospital, being a bit vague on the details, and they did. I got to the ER and told the nurse everything that had been happening and I was sent to a bare room with only a boxed-in tv on the wall as an SIHI, meaning I was both suicidal and homocidal. 

The doctors at my hospital evaluated me and sent a report off to a bugger hospital an hour away that had a dedicated psych ward for patients like me. After 4 hours of waiting, I got the news that this better hospital would accept me as a patient. So, within 15min, I was in an ambulance and on my way to the psych ward.

When I arrived, I was immediately taken to a room where my vitals were recorded and my possessions were taken away, and I had to sign papers agreeing to treatment and their policies. Once I had completed the paperwork, I was made to put on a pair of no-slip socks for safety and was shown to my room. 

It was a fairly bare room, with just a desk to store what few clothes I could bring and two beds. I had to share my room with a nice old man named Arthur, who was there for mild schizophrenia. We also shared a simple bathroom with a toilet, sink, and shower. 

The operation of the psych ward were fairly simple. Meals were at 7:30, 11, and 4:30, and snacks were at 9, 2, and 8:30. We had ""group,"" at 10, 3, and 8 where we learned coping mechanism, positive thinking skills, and did occupational therapy to learn healthy hobbies and habits to give us an outlet for stress and creativity.

 They didnt force you to eat or go to group, though. Some of the patients only came out for meals and slept the rest of the day. Most of us stayed in the common room which had a water fountain and tv. We ended up watching HGTV or the Food Network most of the time. We did watch some Star Wars, too,  which was nice

Each shift change, a new nurse was assigned to you, and they were all very nice in my experience. They brought me my daytime medicine right around 9am and my nighttime medicine around 8pm. Every morning and night your nurse would come to you and ask you questions like how your day was, to rate your anxiety and depression on a scale of 1-10, and so forth. 

Your doctor would come around every morning as well to discuss outpatient plans with you to get you set up for when you leave the hospital, as well as discuss or change your medications. My doctor ended up changing my Lexapro for Prozac, upping my dosage of Lamictal, and adding Remoron to the mix. 

Alongside the doctor, I also saw a psychologist who gave me a thorough evaluation. He let me sit down and talk to him about my life leading up to how I got to the psych ward, and he filled up 3 pages full of notes. Afterwards, I took a 567 true/false quiz called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the Rorschach Test. 

I was in the psych ward until today, March 3rd. Before I left, I had one last talk with my doctor, who gave me a briefing on the psychologist's report. It turns out, I have autism. Specifically, I have Asperger's, so that was a pretty big shock to me. 

I think the biggest thing I learned in my stay at the psych ward was that the other patients are just like you and me. They're completely normal people who just need some help. None of them were mean or psychopaths. They were all just average joes with bad anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I thoroughly enjoyed talking with and getting to know them. 

So, thanks for reading about my experience in a psych ward. I will be more than happy to answer any questions you have",mentalhealth
1558466008.0,My depression is lifting. I haven't felt this happy in 3 years.,"My depression and anxiety had its up and downs ever since I first started working. It went downhill in March when despite having a great therapist and taking meds, I got very suicidal. I was on the edge of the subway platform. I felt like a failure.

&#x200B;

I've been on sick leave since then. I thought I had disappointed so many people in my life, but my therapist has helped me in forgiving myself and moving on little by little. I decided not to go back to my current teaching position for the next school year, which will cause financial instability, but I'm in such a better mentality. Being close with my mom, she has noticed that I smile and talk more, and that what she thought was ""normal stress"" was me barely managing my depression the past three years. I was desperate to ""fix myself,"" and to just ""suck it up because everyone has work stress.""

I have so much respect for teachers. I am interviewing for other schools, but I will most likely do a mix of tutoring/sub work/reception. I am still sad that I couldn't push through another school year, but I am feeling happier that I don't have to go back. I have options. And maybe someday, I will go back to the classroom in the future. I'm working on hobbies I've completely abandoned when I was working. Teaching is a huge commitment. I have mixed feelings about my ideal work situation, but I'm glad I'm taking the time to reflect and slowly plan my next steps.

I'm not depressed anymore and actually wake up with energy and excitement now. 

Vitamin D supplements are super cheap and you can even buy them on Amazon. Consider giving it a try. I noticed the change after only 3-4 days already.

But if you take any meds, check in with your doctor or at least Google to ensure it's safe for you to add the vitamin D supplements (there's like three meds that you'd have to be careful with, as far as I know). 

Additionally, if you're vegetarian/vegan or just don't eat a lot of meat, an iron deficiency could also be a reason for your depression. Iron supplements are also on Amazon for little money.

Hope this helps someone out ‚ù§Ô∏è


Edit: 
As this is getting a lot of traction: What this post was about is that my therapist as well as I thought that I had depression. But taking vitamin D solved many problems for me. A vitamin D deficiency can cause many of the symptoms depression does, up to the point of a misdiagnosis. That's why this post exists. Some people may be misdiagnosed, some people may not even have a therapist to diagnose them so they did it themselves and rolled with it. 

This post is a suggestion to consider the possibility and try something new, to raise awareness that something that looks and feels like depression doesn't have to be exactly that.

Thinking about it now, numerous reg flags were there. I was very defiant and scared of a lot of things. Many of them irrational. I remember being in like junior high and my mother telling me to get something from the car while we were at a family friends party. It was dark already and I took one look outside, saw the car parked across the street and got scared. Idk of what but my mind told me to be scared. I asked my friend to come with me but she didn‚Äôt want to and I think she was scared too because it was dark. I go back to my mom who is talking to her friends and tell her I‚Äôm scared and ‚Äú(friend) doesn‚Äôt want to go with me.  I don‚Äôt want to go to the car‚Äù (friends mom was in the circle of friends like 10 of them and I was hoping she would make her go with me (I know subtle tattletale, in junior high too...currently cringing)) and my mom ended up going with me to the car. I didn‚Äôt think much of this but the next day my dad told me that one of the parents called me a spoiled brat as soon as I left with my mom to the car. Looking back I should have told my mom personally but I didn‚Äôt think it would matter since the people we were surrounded by were childhood friends who knew me at a young age. 

Growing up in my house was overall not good emotionally. Lots of instability with my father‚Äôs moods and sometimes my mother‚Äôs. I ended up being a rude child and would get angrily reprimanded by my parents (sometimes physically even if it didn‚Äôt hurt...it still did...if that makes sense). I remember saying goodbye to my parents friends (at their friends house) by just waving the off in an ‚Äúeh‚Äù manner (I tried to be cute and joke with them...also I was half tired) my parents pushed me to hug them and kiss them (cultural thing) but I was just like ‚Äúmeh‚Äù and didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt realize I was embarrassing my parents and their friends. I came off as rude. I was like 12 or 13 at the time. As soon as we got into the car my dad exploded in anger and shouted at me to never do that again. He said this while also putting his fist to my knee banging on my knee every time I didn‚Äôt give a coherent ‚Äúyes‚Äù to him when he told me to never act that way again. I was in tears. I really didn‚Äôt think anything of my actions. Looking back, yeah it is rude of me but I don‚Äôt think they was the correct parental way to go about things. 

There were many instances like this. Where I would come off rude and anxious especially when I didn‚Äôt get my way with things. Forcing my friends to play with me when they didn‚Äôt want to. Telling on them to their older siblings hoping they would make their sibling play with me only to be told ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt want to play with you. That‚Äôs not my problem‚Äù, picking fights with my siblings, screaming and shouting loud enough that the neighbors can hear me... 

I was recently diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, and ADHD. In addition to my MDD, OCD, and GAD. I feel like a light just switched on this year and made me go ‚Äúoh wow I really wasn‚Äôt a normal kid‚Äù.

tldr: to a lot of people growing up I came off as an annoying and rude immature brat but after analyzing a lot of my behaviors and my upbringing as an adult, I now realize it was possibly a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues.",mentalhealth

I never realized how that manifested my suicidal thoughts. I‚Äôve wanted to die for the smallest things since I was in 4th grade. After doing some personal development, I realized that my need to be cared for was always associated with hurt, sickness, and other people were responsible to make me feel cared for. 

Teach children that they‚Äôre loved & their thoughts matter. Death or sickness is not the only way to feel cared for. I now know why I always want to die. If your loved ones will only care once you‚Äôre dead, what‚Äôs the point of living?

1592706236.0,Why does my (20m) mind immediately default to suicide when something bad happens to me?,"(I meant 20F and now I can't change the title)

I am very prone to spiralling, or snowballing, when something bad happens to me. 

Recently, I've been getting into arguments with my mum and it's been making me feel like shit. She tells me I'm brainwashed, makes me feel stupid, and a lot more. When I brought it up to her she denied the lot and the only apology I got was a 'sorry you feel that way' 

This isn't something small, I don't think, but i also feel as though I'm overreacting, but that just makes me feel worse, and so the spiral begins.

And it always ends with a 'you should just kill yourself'. Almost always followed with a 'no you retard thats a bad idea' 

Because other than little things like that, my life is fine. I have friends, a loving partner (long distance atm), a roof over my head and hot meals. I'm fine. Yet I'm not. And, again, it makes me feel worse that there are people who have it so, so badly, and yet I have the audacity to feel the way I do?

I do not want to bring any of this up to my mother. She would just gaslight me again. My partner knows, though, and is as supportive as he can be in the current situation. That's all I can ask for, right?

I can't get over the mistakes of my past, where I did or said mean things in the heat of the moment, or when I did or said things that were cringy or stupid.

I haven't shaved in months and if you're grossed out by that, stop reading now. 

I haven't shaved anywhere. Legs, armpits, pubic area. It just seemed too overwhelming. My boyfriend doesn't mind, so my sex life didn't really get worse because of that and I live in a colder climate, so wearing long pants during the summer was completely normal.

To be honest, I kinda liked how things were. Less waste, more time, less skin irritation and stuff. But I knew it didn't come from my worldview, but from my depression. Shaving is the least important, as I could go days without eating, without brushing my teeth and showering. 

So before I go on: shaving isn't necessary, showering is. So if you're a male, female, whatever, just don't shave if you don't want to. It's not a part of hygiene. You won't ""sweat more"" because of some hair. But take a shower from time to time. Not a full-on spa singing one hour shower, but get in there for a few minutes. Even if it'll be just standing under pouring water. 

But if you want to - just like I did - go for it. I shaved my whole body today, I used some coconut oil on my legs and scented oil under my armpits (zero-waste deodorant!). Apart from that, I also did a full on skin care routine and brushed my teeth AND flossed. Wow.
I'm sure most people do it regularly and it grosses them out when they have a single piece of salad between their teeth after a meal. But for me, it was a huge milestone.

Watched more football. Won some money off a bet I had made with LSU. My mom came over and she and my fiance wrapped gifts while I was watching the LSU game. Afterwards I was still riding high so we went out to eat to celebrate. Even invited my girls best friend to join us as it would be my treat. I didn't feel any anxiety or paranoia while we were eating. Came home and hung out, minus my mom, for another three hours. It felt amazing to have a day where there was no episodes. No panic. No anxiety. No paranoia. No depression. No hallucinating.

1663026768.0,To the teenagers behind me at the store,"I'm sure you thought the comments you made about me were clever, that must be why you said them loudly enough for everyone within 20 feet to hear. I assume it was super amusing making fun of me based on the giggles and laughs from your group behind me as I used the self check out for the few things I was buying. Since you lot are obviously comedic geniuses I thought I'd share your wittisms.

""Omg why would she ever leave her house in shorts?!"" Said by the pretty blonde girl whose shirt I internally admired earlier. 

You were pretty spot on since I'd hadn't worn shorts outside my home in almost 2 years. I had finally found a pair that fit well and were long enough so I thought they looked ok. Thank you for disabusing me of that notion.

""She probably doesn't leave the house often anyway. Maybe she's afraid she won't fit through the door one of these days."" Said from who I assume was blondie's boyfriend. 

Well, you were wrong about the door thing, that's a full on exaggeration because even I know I'm not that big. However you were right about me not leaving the house often but it has nothing to do with weight. It's because I'm still severely depressed over the unexpected passing of my fianc√© less than 2 years ago.

""Look she's buying spinach! I guarantee it's not for her!"" This was from the brunette with blue highlights. 

Sorry to disappoint but it's totally for me.

""Why doesn't she just get that weight loss surgery? She would obviously qualify."" From a different brunette. 

Well actually honey, I already had it when I was 17 and barely qualified. This was in the very early days of bariatric surgery and I obviously didn't have ideal results. What's even worse though is it's left me with multiple, life long health issues and chronic pain. I've had to have several additional surgeries to try and correct things, with little success. A lot of those health issues mean medication and many of those medications have weight gain as a side effect. I also have Hypothyroidism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome which both can cause weight gain. As can depression, which I mentioned earlier.

""I'd kill myself if I ever got that big."" Said by blondie. 

I guess it's A: good you're not because no matter how horrible your comments I would never wish for you to feel like you needed to die and B: I guess I'm mentally stronger than you. That's probably because of all the shit I've been through but believe me there are often days when I think I'd be better off dead. And I'd be lying if I didn't say how hard it was after hearing your comments to just make it to my car before I broke down crying. 

I don't know why you all felt the need to be so cruel but I hope eventually you learn to have a little more empathy. You don't know me or my story, but you judged me based solely on my weight and found me lacking. Therefore I was worthy of your scorn. 

Your comments hurt, and I imagine they will stick with me for awhile, but they won't break me. However, someday, if you continue this act you might end up being the last straw that does break someone. I hope you never have to realize that your comments pushed a person to end their life and I also hope you never have to feel the way you made me feel today. 

Everyone, please just keep in mind that you don't know what people are going through. Do better, because not only is there no award for being a bad human but karma enjoys being an ironic bitch.",mentalhealth

1623792334.0,It's been a month since I decided not to kill myself.,"A month ago I jokingly told my online friend that nobody would care if I died (not directly but it was obvious I was talking about that) and she said that she would cry if I died. That's what broke me. I never cry but that was the first time in months where I cried for real. It was like something hit me. We aren't extremely close but she unknowingly got me through the hardest time in my life. I owe her everything. 
That was when I decided I will not die. Ever. No matter how unappealing the concept of living became.

It's been a month. 

A teacher at my high school helped me realize what I achieved and that I should be proud of myself. I'm not a native English speaker but I taught myself English in 3 years and by the time I was 15 I was at level C1. She showed me that it's OK to be proud of the things I did. And for the first time, I believed her.
After starting my antidepressants everything slowly got clearer and brighter. 
I even got a friend at school! An actual friend that wants to talk to me! She sometimes laughs at the fact that I say ""thank you"" every time she agrees to go somewhere with me but I'm just so happy and surprised that I'm talking to people.
I never thought I could be this happy. I feel like I'm 12 again, happy with friends, going out. I never thought it was possible to get out of the lowest of the lows.

It's still not perfect but it's definitely enough for now. I'm still not in a safe situation when it comes to my sexuality, but I have support from my roommate, who likes to give me tough love from time to time, from my English teacher who's an absolute sweetheart, my friend from school who likes me for who I am, my online friend who's probably reading this right now (love you bitch) and my cats who are the sweetest and most annoying creatures ever.

I don't have a job. I could theoretically work a job, but I would not perform well at the job at all and possibly get fired for being unproductive, it would also do more harm than good to me. But the main reason I don't have a job is because a job would drain my time and energy, which I desperately need to work on my physical and mental health and also my to-do list at home, I just cannot handle any more responsibilities currently. Its too much, im already fighting a battle 24/7 and I do not wanna attempt to work even harder than what is physically possible.

So now I often get judged ""you are 23 why dont you have a job??"" or ""you should be studying""

""you should"" ""why dont you"" but when I reply that I don't have time and energy for a job or whatever they want me to do, they reply that I'm just lazzy and privileged.

I guess that someone who has always been mentally healthy cannot understand what it feels like to be unmotivated, to be physically tired or mentally, to have a brain that does not function well, to wake up tired even after 9 hours of sleep.

1606424634.0,Self-care is not participating when you don‚Äôt want to.," There  is power in standing up for yourself and sticking to your personal  boundaries regarding how you participate in life as a trauma survivor. I  hate the constant barrage of showing up because of obligation. Fuck  that. I mean, when I think about the fact that people will shame you  over not doing something that you don‚Äôt want to do, I get irate. I think  about how many times in our lives that we are put in the position of  showing up due to social constructs, and I want to smash my face into  the wall. **You don‚Äôt owe anyone your time or sanity.**

I  implore you to please take care of yourself over the next few weeks  starting today. The number one thing that people healing trauma can do  is to say no or to say nothing at all. You don‚Äôt have to go to family  gatherings and events where past abusers are present. You don‚Äôt have to  go to work get-togethers because you are in recovery, and Tom can‚Äôt have  just one drink. You don‚Äôt have to go to the hundreds of things you are  invited to. Why? Because you are a goddamn adult, and you have the  choice here. No one is going to force you into a car, to put the key in  the ignition, drop the gear to D, and hit the road. If I‚Äôm wrong about  that, we have much more severe problems on our hands.

Creating agency as a trauma survivor

Look,  here is the deal. We are used to putting our needs secondary as CPTSD  survivors. At some point, our needs got put on the back burner as a  survival mechanism. That is OK. We can acknowledge that. However, as we  move forward, we must follow our gut instinct and listen to what our  soul tells us. If everything in you is screaming, **don‚Äôt go,** then don‚Äôt go. And don‚Äôt tell me that it‚Äôs easy said than done because you are in control. Y-O-U.

You  have the power here, and look, I know that is scary, but it‚Äôs true. You  can step into your personal boundaries, and your right as a human being  is that you only have to do what you want to do. I trust that the truth  of our healing journey recognizes that we are allowed to have agency in  our lives.

I challenge you to  continue to double-down on your personal boundaries and your right to  say no. Hell, start today. No law states you must suffer through another  family thanksgiving with your narcissistic mother, verbally abusive  step-father, racist grandmother, or anyone in between. Today, if you  need to say no, please say no. Order Pad Thai; it‚Äôs better than turkey  anyway.

I am an mental health tech, and my job is to basically be a glorified babysitter for special needs kids. I'm good at my job, but something last night makes me start shaking when I think about it. 

One of my clients scares me. I don't know her exact problem, but her father told me that her mother had done dope and drank alcohol when she was pregnant with her. 

This girl was throwing a tantrum after we left a pet store. She insisted that she held cats (which we couldn't because covid.) First she whined, then she cried, then she snapped. I had to call her mother, and we stayed on the phone with her to get her to leave the pet store, literally one step at a time. 

When we got to the car, she began *screaming* at the top of her lungs that she wanted my tablet to play games on. I wouldn't let her, because she already threatened to break it. This lasted for twenty minutes. I drove with her, another client, and my shadower(new hire in training), to the highway. The girl suddenly stopped screaming, unbuckled herself, and got up next to me while I was driving 70mph. She leaned against me, and told me that I was ugly, had no friends, deserved to die, and would kill me if I let her. She began reaching for the wheel all slowly and dramatically like she was going to yank it into the oncoming traffic from my left side. The shadower yanked her back, but she kept lunging for the wheel, trying to make us crash into the other cars. I eventually pulled over on the side of the highway and called her mom. The girl then opened the car door and tried to run out into the field, saying that she was going to get us in trouble for losing her. We dragged her back into the car, and put on the child lock. She didn't like that, and tried to fight us once we got settled again. When her mom finally came, she started acting all nice, denying everything that happened. She took the child home, and we took the other client home.

I forgive this girl, because she has a mental illness and couldn't control herself. Yet, I can't stop shaking, and I couldn't sleep that night because I kept dreaming about deadly car crashes. Car crashes are one of my biggest fears, I cant help but feel terrified when I even think about getting in one. I get genuinely scared when I picture her in my mind, and deep down I want her dead. 

I will have to see her again, only time I will be prepared. How do I get over this fear that causes me to black out, start trembling, and cant form words correctly?

But what about someone you find annoying or don‚Äôt like? If you think about someone you‚Äôve met who wasn‚Äôt very nice to you, or someone that was rude or did something you didn‚Äôt agree with, you might ask the question why would you feel compassion for someone who behaves this way. 

The importance of compassion isn‚Äôt only to relieve suffering and make the world a better place, it‚Äôs to free yourself from your own suffering - your sadness, your anxiety and particularly your anger. When you see the suffering of others in their behaviour it helps to reduce your own resentments.

But where we can really struggle is feeling compassion towards ourselves; when we‚Äôre suffering we sometimes punish ourselves more for not being good enough. Compassion begins with yourself - when you let go of the idea of who you think you need to be and accept yourself as you are it‚Äôs an act of kindness that allows you to start to let go of suffering.

1575154056.0,Has anyone else had depression and other mental illnesses for so much of your life that you feel like it's part of your identity and as much as you hate it you can't imagine yourself without it?,"I'm 29. At age 13 I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and about six months ago I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I also get anxiety attacks sporadically but never been diagnosed with anxiety to my knowledge. The first time I had mental health problems I was four or five years old. I got put into a psychiatric hospital for a week when I was five (don't want to get too much into why I was put in but basically I had extreme trouble regulating my emotions), and it was at that point that I internalized the thought (or message I thought I was getting) that I was bad and wrong and messed up. A year later my mom died from cancer and I thought I had made her sick because I stressed her out too much from being ""bad"". So again my vision of myself as a bad person was heavily internalized and confirmed. Then I went through bullying and teasing at school from age 8 to 12 because I was fat (from comfort eating because of losing my mom) and awkward and every demeaning thing the bullies said just confirmed my belief in myself being a disgusting ugly embarrassing pathetic piece of trash. Around age 10 was the first time I wanted to die. Age 13 I was hospitalized again for being suicidal. I've been on about 10-12 various medications (at different times) since I was 13 trying to treat my mental health. I have done probably 10 years of weekly therapy appointments. And despite all that nothing helped me 100% or even 50%. I still was depressed and anxious, I developed an eating disorder that went in and out of my life for 10 years, I still hated myself and had very low self-esteem and self-injured and felt suicidal and just...dark.

At 29 I still feel like I'm just destined to be this way. My biological father died from alcoholism after having it for about 35 years and he also had been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder recently before he died. My mother's side of the family had depression and anxiety and food addiction. I just feel like I'm destined to be and stay mentally ill. And I feel like it's part of my identity. Ever since my mom died I've gone through life feeling isolated and different from everyone else around me. I feel I'm just a broken person and I've felt it so long I really internalized it at a very early age. I know it sounds ridiculous but since the dark, self-hating, self-sabotaging thoughts are all I have known for practically all my life, they are.... comforting to me in a strange way. It feels.... right? to just wrap myself up in a blanket of sadness and turn my back on the world. I can't see myself being any other way. I feel like it's formed my personality? I'm not really sure. I just... at this point in my life I can see how not fixing my depression and other issues will leave my life in ruins and possibly end with me dead by suicide or reckless behavior, or long-term hospitalized. Obviously neither of those I would like, but another part of me feels indifferent to that happening. Like, ""...meh, you're a piece of shit and so messed up anyways, you're just another human out of the billions of others contributing to the demise of this planet so it really wouldn't be a big deal and would be better in the long run.""

I'll end here before I continue rambling on. Basically, I feel like being mentally ill is embedded into my DNA and is in every part of me and I can't find the motivation to try to change it or even the belief that I deserve that change or that it will even ever happen. Additionally I feel like I have no idea who I would be without it. Has anyone felt this? Can anyone relate?",mentalhealth
1569544837.0,"Six months after my suicide attempt, I‚Äôm traveling alone and loving life.","Almost exactly six months ago, I tried to take my life. I was misdiagnosed with MDD but after my attempt and hospitalization was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was put on new medication, started therapy, moved to a new apartment and generally hit the reset button on my life.

Now, I‚Äôm traveling Europe alone for the first time. I‚Äôm doing what I want when I want, meeting new people, seeing things I never thought I‚Äôd see, and loving every minute of it. Every second I think about the fact that I could have not had this opportunity. I could have cut my life short and never been to Europe, never felt the freedom of standing at the top of a waterfall in Iceland or on the River Thames in London. 

I‚Äôm so thankful that I made the call before it was too late, and that I had people in my corner when I woke up in the emergency room that cold March morning. I‚Äôm glad that I chose life, despite how hard it can be, how cloudy and dark and hopeless it is at times. I‚Äôm glad that I sought help and got the help that I needed.

I still feel hopeless and lost and miserable sometimes. We all do. But I want every person here to take a deep breath before they consider ending their short, beautiful life too soon. You never know what more there is to see and feel and experience. I love myself now, and I love you all.

Cheers xx

Edit: Thank you all for your support! I wanted to clarify that I wasn‚Äôt meaning to brag or seem like I just dropped everything and hopped on a plane. I actually planned this trip back in January, before my attempt, which perhaps makes it even more profound. I was tempted to cancel the trip during my treatment and recovery, but after six months I‚Äôm finally trusting myself again and feeling connected to myself and the world around me. Getting on the plane felt terrifying, but I‚Äôm so glad I went through with something that is good for me mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

1588772128.0,We need to change the way we talk about anxiety and depression.,"
I think we need to change the name of anxiety and also depression so that they sound as serious as they are. So many people just completely brush off these serious mental health issues because they are so common. Thinking that ‚Äòfeeling depressed‚Äô or a bit ‚Äòanxious‚Äô is the same as a full blown mental illness. Telling someone you have depression or anxiety feels like it has the same impact, as telling someone you have a cold. 
It needs to be talked about in a more serious manner so that people suffering from these sometimes life ruining mental illnesses don‚Äôt have to be ashamed. 
Pretty much every person i have spoke to who has or did have clinal depression (including myself) say that they often feel guilty, they have thoughts similar too ‚Äúother people have it so much worse than me‚Äù or ‚Äúim just over exaggerating.‚Äù This is not how things should be. People shouldn‚Äôt have to feel bad for being in pain. Think about it this way, you dont see a guy with a broken leg feeling guilty about having broke his leg. No, he goes to the doctors, gets help, lets it heal and will likely receive get well soon letters from family or friends. Why does the same not happen with a broken mind?
If everyone in a community can realise how serious anxiety and depression actually is, then they can empathise with those who suffer, helping MILLIONS of people who‚Äôs lives are a constant struggle, to at least feel a little bit more understood, accepted by their peers and less guilty. That to me, would be a massive step in the right direction ‚ù§Ô∏è

1594815208.0,"Being lonely in the 21st Century where we are living in a super-connected world is fricking hard, mentally taxing and it burns me out","To avoid getting into the details, I have to build a thick wall around myself because I have been struggling with multiple mental health issues for pretty much all my life.

But slowly and surely, I have been gathering strategies, techniques and other methods on how to deal with them, even though the amount of effort and time that it took me was way longer than I waited for them to be and I still have a lot stuff to delve into in order to master these strategies.

Over the years, I have been learning how to break that thick wall that I built over the years and slowly creep into the dark unknown and face these demons and even face the real world due to that my experiences has left me with a scared and scarred image of the world.

But for some reason, dealing with loneliness is perhaps one of the most exhausting, nerve-wrecking and humiliating war that I had to fight through.

I am well aware that loneliness is not easy to deal with - it is a mentally tricky thing to face and counter and can lead to so many other traps and other complications and difficulties that you sometimes become stuck in a maze or a in a super-thick and sticky web of different threads with different poisons slowly sucking away what is left of your blood, soul and health.

It is a double-edged sword that you want to get out of this invisible prison but at the same time, the prison is also your only ""home"" and walking out of it is very scary and the fear of being rejected, even if you try to be as friendly as possible, is very tough to overcome.

&#x200B;

The person few years, I had to really pull myself from my bootstraps to overcome the traps of loneliness - the fear of being rejected, the neediness of attention and the appropriate social skills for different situations.

Yet for some reason, as much as the world of today *should* be able to allow me to use the resources that we use today like social media to my advantage to reach out but in reality, it is often the opposite!!

&#x200B;

I know that social media is a big joke and a trap of itself where behind every smile and photo of the last party, dinner or get away that you want to hides a dark thing that you do not want to share to the rest of the world.

Yet at the same time, seeing the sheer amount of photos and posts where I see smiles and even laughs with other people, friends or even random strangers, it makes me feel angry and pathetic with myself, desperate to do something about it.

I reached out plenty of times with other people but more often than not, communication in the 21st Century makes us more alien than connecting to one another.

It is super easy to ghost someone nowadays or leave a seen without even giving a clear reason why or giving the cold shoulder because the person you are talking to is simply a stranger or you do not like for no reason whatsoever. I constantly feel that I do not know where I am with another person. It is humiliating and nerve-wracking and it burns me out. It makes me feel pitiful, petty, little. It makes me feel less of a human being and like I am being passively-aggressively bullied.

&#x200B;

Yet it is also pretty hilarious that the technology of today is supposed to make us more connected yet it makes it too easy to push people away. 

Why is it common to leave only seen almost after every message? Why not just speak from the heart? Or just say a word? Anything

I feel humiliated and angry and constantly going through a thick and mighty storm every day to keep myself sane throughout this process and it feels like I am going around in circles or walking inside a maze where I have no idea where I am going.

I know that loneliness is also in my head (even though my mind and body have real reactions to the feeling) but this feeling is incredibly overwhelming and when I try to reach out, nobody is available or I have to be very careful of what to say to others as though I am walking on eggshells because of random excuses like being busy or unavailable and/or whatever excuse they can think of to avoid contact",mentalhealth

If I say ‚Äúyou‚Äù or ‚Äúyou people‚Äù, I‚Äôm referring to people who subscribe to the bullshit thinking I‚Äôm about to outline. This was meant to be posted to r/unpopularopinion but got deleted, so I figured y‚Äôall could appreciate my sentiment instead.

It seems like whenever I see a post about mental health (outside of subs that are directly related to the concept), the same point comes up.

*‚ÄùDuH‚Ä¶ like 90% of people who say they have depression are just faking it for attention! All those kids on TikTok just want to LARP as Billie Eilish and pretend they have a mental illness so they can be trendy!!‚Äù*

Just, stop. And I say this as someone with *diagnosed* depression, anxiety and ADHD. Here‚Äôs why this way of thinking is complete and utter **horse shit**.

First off, depression/anxiety are *incredibly* common, and exist on a wide spectrum of severity. When people see someone who claims they‚Äôre depressed, but still manages to go to work/school without many problems, they automatically jump to the thought of ‚Äúoh well they seem to be doing pretty well. they‚Äôre not *really* depressed.‚Äù

This is such bullshit because unless you‚Äôve advanced science by 5 decades and figured out how to read someone else‚Äôs thoughts, you don‚Äôt know what the fuck they‚Äôre going through. Even if that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person seems functional, there‚Äôs no telling what‚Äôs going on in their head. 

You think everyone who has ‚Äúreal‚Äù depression is a lifeless sack of garbage who sits in bed crying all day? Guess what, there‚Äôs probably a handful of people at your job/in your class that have ‚Äúreal‚Äù depression. They just hide it well because that‚Äôs what people with mental health issues *have to do* in order to succeed.

Second, on the flip side of the coin, *so many* people assume the complete opposite. ‚ÄúThis person has depression and ADHD, but doesn‚Äôt take care of themselves and can‚Äôt hold down a job without breaking down? God, another faker, huh? That‚Äôs not mental illness, that‚Äôs *laziness*‚Äù.

Like, *what the fuck is wrong with you???* That‚Äôs literally what severe mental illness does to you? If ‚Äúdepression‚Äù can‚Äôt exist if you‚Äôre doing well on the surface, and it *also* can‚Äôt exist if you‚Äôre doing terribly on the surface, then what the hell do you think depression is!?

But even putting aside the obvious lack of understanding regarding mental health, it‚Äôs *still* fucked up to call someone out as a ‚Äúfaker‚Äù.

Look at it this way, let‚Äôs say someone actually *is* faking it. They post on social media claiming they have depression, but they actually don‚Äôt.

*WHO FUCKING CARES?*

Even if they don‚Äôt have a diagnosed mental illness, they clearly aren‚Äôt getting the attention they need outside of social media. And since when is asking for attention a bad thing? Most of the people who receive these complaints are *literally children.* You think that if a fucking *child* is resorting to random strangers online for support, there‚Äôs absolutely *nothing* wrong with them? And they *don‚Äôt* need people to hear them out? Of fucking course not!!

And here‚Äôs the biggest problem. WHO ARE WE TO DECIDE WHETHER SOMEONE IS FAKING OR NOT?

Mental illness transcends class, race and gender. Nobody is immune from chronic depression/anxiety. 99% of the time you *cannot fucking tell* if someone has a mental illness or not. Because it‚Äôs a **M E N T A L** illness. 

So why take the chance on saying ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre just lying for attention‚Äù, when there‚Äôs a strong possibility that they‚Äôre serious and you‚Äôre just making it worse by making them feel like an impostor?

Seriously, what does anyone stand to gain from calling someone out for ‚Äúfaking it‚Äù? 

‚ÄúOh, but the more people who fake it, the more stigma there will be against people who have *actual* mental illness.‚Äù

Bull. Shit. Where do you think that stigma is coming from? Because it sure as fuck isn‚Äôt coming from people who actually care about mental health.

It‚Äôs coming from people like you, who refuse to believe that mental illness can affect *everyone*. No mental health professional, or doctor, or caring person is shutting these people down. It‚Äôs just people like you. The resources to treat mental health are always available, but people who need them aren‚Äôt getting them because they‚Äôre constantly told that they‚Äôre making it worse for people who have ‚Äúreal‚Äù mental illness.

And one more thing.

‚ÄúOh you probably self-diagnosed, didn‚Äôt you? That means your mental illness isn‚Äôt real.‚Äù

Oh, fuuuuuuck off.

First of all, how do you think you get a diagnosis in the first place? You think a doctor is gonna come to your house, take one look at you and say ‚Äúyep, you‚Äôve got depression‚Äù. That‚Äôs not how it works! You get a diagnosis by recognizing symptoms within yourself, condensing them and narrowing it down to a few possibilities, then bringing that info to a professional when/if you can. This process is known as, you guessed it, **self-diagnosis**.

And what about people who *can‚Äôt* get diagnosed? I‚Äôm lucky enough to live in a place where mental health is taken seriously and covered by insurance. So, I was able to be diagnosed and treated from a young age.

What about people who aren‚Äôt so lucky? In the US, you can pay up to $500 for an initial consultation. Not everyone can afford that. And in some countries, mental health treatment is a fucking joke.  It‚Äôs chocked up to weakness or insanity sometimes, so good luck getting a diagnosis in one of those places. And actually getting a prescription for meds? That‚Äôs a whole other mountain to climb, even in more progressive countries.

So if you‚Äôre in an area where getting a diagnosis is next to impossible, what are you supposed to do? Just sit there feeling miserable and telling no one because you ‚Äúmight be faking it‚Äù? Fuck no, you get online and do what you can to find support and raise awareness for others in your situation.

Bottom line, nobody knows what mental illnesses someone else is or isn‚Äôt dealing with. And even if you do, why the hell do you care?

1553617722.0,"Does anyone else hate how people throw around the terms ""narcissist"" and ""sociopath"" on Reddit?","Narcissistic personality disorder is a horrible, painful condition. It's a mental disorder that, just like any, ruins the lives of people who never wanted to be this way. Like other personality disorders it takes away someone's control over their own thoughts and behaviours and twists their perceptions of the world around them. They've quite often been through abuse which has led them to develop their condition, and often they aren't even able to see that there's anything wrong - just like in other psych conditions.

Sociopathy hasn't even been considered a real diagnosis for decades. The closest thing is antisocial personality disorder, which is another horrible condition that people are forced to live with. It damages someone's ability to empathise and feel positive emotions, their ability to control strong bursts of anger or sadness and to properly deal with their emotions, and it makes people struggle to control impulsive behaviour and fit in with society. Someone with ASPD isn't the stoic, emotionless killer from a horror film or the cool, charismatic, cunning CEO. In fact they're very often poor and not too clever, having grown up in toxic environments and never getting the support they need to develop properly.

Both of these conditions are extremely complex and very, very hard to identify and diagnose, even for an experienced psychiatrist sitting across from their patient.

Reddit uses these terms the way people used ""retarded"" a decade ago. People have taken crippling conditions that they know fuck all about beyond watching slasher films and Dr Phil, and turned them into slurs.

It's even worse just how readily people make these armchair diagnoses. Whenever anyone does something bad, they must be a *sociopath!* It couldn't just be that normal people like you and me sometimes do bad things for a variety of very complex reasons - no, they must be a sociopath (and that means monster!)

Whenever a /r/relationship_advice or /r/amitheasshole post describes someone doing something that could even just be interpreted as slightly unreasonable, or a slight overreaction, they're a TOXIC NARCISSIST! No, they didn't just snap because they've been under a lot of stress like any human can, they dont just seem unreasonable because we don't know what's going on in their head and know their side of the story. No, they're a NARCISSIST! And it seems *everyone* on Reddit knows at least one narcissist, usually more.


And how do you deal with someone who has a debilitating mental health condition? You cut them out of your life completely! After all, they're toxic and they'll ruin your life if you let them!

1597531821.0,my brain tries to convince me that everyone secretly hates me,"I was diagnosed with social anxiety 4 years ago.
Lately I've been noticing that after social interactions I can't stop thinking about the ways I ""messed up"". And even though I'm able to convince myself logically that it wasn't that bad and that people don't hate me for it, I keep thinking that they just pretend to like me and secretly think I'm a terrible person.

I can't stop beating myself up over minor mistakes and I try to distract myself from these thoughts, but they always come back and then they won't leave me alone. I've talked to others and asked for their assessment of the situation that I currently can't stop thinking about and they reassure me that it's not that bad which helps for a while but then I go back to thinking that I made a horrible mistake and people are lying to me when they say it's okay.

This happens with things that happened years ago or when I was a child, too. It's keeping me up at night, it makes me feel physically sick, it makes it hard to eat and makes me angry because I'm trying to get better, I'm trying to put myself out there and overcome my fears but as soon as I'm alone with my thoughts it backfires.

I try to fight this feeling by playing memory games, drinking a lot of coffee and reading lots of non-fiction books but nothing helps.

in the last time I'm again at a very low point of my life and deep depression. I noticed that my feelings get worse when I'm scrolling through instagram seeing the posts and ""lives"" of other people and friends. I know it's not always the whole reality they show there, it's only the best part they post often with big theatre to have a worthy post. That's life today. Still I feel so bad seeing other people being with other people together having fun which remembers me that I should do the same but I'm not able to have much joy due to my depression and social anxiety. Then I feel guilty and worthless.

Who else here has the same experiences? Did anyone of you quit or at least ignore instagram for a time and saw definite positive improvements in their mental health? I think I won't delete Instagram as it's something a bit important like WhatsApp. Well ok it's not even near as important as WhatsApp but I don't know I probably would miss some things as I already deleted snapchat years ago and people tell me oh you missed this and that I sent you. But that's no problem for me, WhatsApp & Instagram is enough of the always online always having to present the perfect life bullshit.

I would love to read about your experiences and suggestions! Much love to everyone with depression, it's only the brain telling us false things and emotions. It's not reality.

1666045608.0,33 m. I had sex with my therapist after two years of being treated for Borderline Personality Disorder.,"So this is a long one. Going to try and keep it short, and be available to answer questions.

Two years ago, with nearly 20 years of mood swings, sadness, anger, substance abuse, and hyper sexual behaviors behind me, I decided it was time to get help. My wife of 8 years was asking for a divorce, and my life had become unmanageable.

I started seeing a psychologist through the VA. I‚Äôm an army veteran. She turned out to be a specialist in BPD and after some time was able to diagnose me. I had always suspected either BPD or Bipolar. 

We‚Äôve worked together for about 2 years and have made amazing progress. She leads a Dialectic Behavioral Therapy group that worked wonders for me. It was life changing. Emotional intelligence, mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, and distress tolerance are all part of my life now. I‚Äôm not perfect, and I‚Äôm always willing to put in the work, but life is better than ever before. I truly feel like my BPD is in recession. I also recently got sober, which helps a lot.

So this last February my wife and I separated. This is primarily due to my unstable moods, anger issues, substance abuse, and hyper sexuality. I moved into my own place and it took months to stabilize and get into a healthy and productive routine.

My last appointment with my therapist, I mentioned that I understood I was in a vulnerable situation and I was taking dating very cautiously. Being roughly 70 days sober, not completely over my ex, and prone to emotional dependency, I need to really consider my actions and emotions. I‚Äôm in a vulnerable place where I could relapse in a few different ways.

Well two days after that she texts me at 11:30 pm and starts flirting with me. She‚Äôs never texted me before and acknowledged how risky it was to do so.

She even mentioned the fact that I said I was vulnerable, and stated she felt vulnerable as well.

I at first told her I wasn‚Äôt available because I had gone on a date with a new girl and wanted to give that my full attention while I figured out where it was going. Also, I‚Äôm not attracted to this woman.

Another day goes by and I can‚Äôt fight the curiosity. I started texting her and just soaked up the attention what felt sexually deviant. Asking her about why she likes me. What she‚Äôs into. What she would do to me. What she wants me to do to her.

Here‚Äôs the thing. I have a history periods of being sexually involved with people who I‚Äôm not attracted to because I like the attention, I like being used, and I like things that feel taboo. I almost always end up feeling ashamed and disgusted by my behavior when this happens. And this woman, more than anyone knows all of that about me. 

Well two nights after she texted me for the first time, I went over to her place to give her what she wanted. She didn‚Äôt pressure me to, so we were both consenting, but it doesn‚Äôt feel good now. I almost immediately realized I wasn‚Äôt into what I was doing, but I stayed and kept doing things until I got her off. Then I left.

Looking back on it, it feels a little predatory. Here‚Äôs the person I‚Äôve been most honest with about my hyper sexual episodes and how they‚Äôve always made me feel bad. And I end up getting baited into just that. 

I‚Äôm not going to report her. At this point I should have better control over myself. But I‚Äôm disappointed in both of us.

I‚Äôve since asked her to refer me to a new therapist. She did so happily and respectfully, and the new one feels like a great fit. 

There ya go.

EDIT:

I want to thank everyone for the overwhelming response to this post. I have to admit, I was honestly struggling with whether or not I should feel bad about this situation. It‚Äôs pretty clear now that what she did was wrong. Had the cards not been so stacked in her favor, she‚Äôs definitely not someone I would‚Äôve been intimate with.

So here‚Äôs the update, and I‚Äôll say at the beginning that many people are going to be less than satisfied. I reached out to her and told her exactly how I feel about what happened, how it was manipulative and I‚Äôm left feeling used. She seemed to be apologetic and understanding as to why I felt that way. I say ‚Äúseemed‚Äù because to be brutally honest I don‚Äôt know if this is a one time fuck up, or a calculated cruel person just doing her thing. Of course when you get called out on doing something wrong, you say whatever it takes to deescalate the situation. So who the fuck knows. 

I want to preface this next part with my feelings of how to support people dealing with abuse, trauma, and the like. I think it‚Äôs important to make yourself available to listen, offer support, and support them in finding closure, however they deem necessary. I‚Äôve had friends who were assaulted and didn‚Äôt report it, and I tried to understand that it‚Äôs their closure to find, not mine.

She said I‚Äôd be well within my rights to report this, if I decided to do so. I‚Äôm not planning on reporting her. I‚Äôm not blaming myself for what happened, but again it‚Äôs not uncommon for me to get myself into situations I regret like this. I‚Äôve expressed how I feel about it, I‚Äôm choosing to believe that she is sorry and remorseful (choosing because again, I‚Äôll never really know) and I‚Äôm moving on. It‚Äôs not fair to be taken advantage of, but I also don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs fair for me to be the one who has to report this and take on that process. 

Go easy on me, but this is where I‚Äôm at with it. Who knows, I may end up feeling differently about it in the future. Hell even as I write this I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúdid she ever care about my well being? She never contacting me outside of a meeting to check on me. Even after I‚Äôd cry in a meeting and tell her I don‚Äôt know what to do, and I couldn‚Äôt fix my life, I couldn‚Äôt control myself. She never texted. It was only when she wanted sex that she went there‚Äù. Yeah. Idk. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. Sorry to let y‚Äôall down. 

Thanks again for the validation and support.",mentalhealth

Let‚Äôs throw in some anxiety and a dash of depression while we‚Äôre at it!‚Äù","Living with a mother who has a mental illness, caused me to have a lot of resentment and anger as a child. It has also caused me to have my own issues with anxiety and depression. 

My mom had her own business and was very successful. When I was 8 we had a flood in our house that completely destroyed her business. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but she started doing heavy drugs. She would constantly pass out and not eat for days. 

At 8, I was no longer a child but a parent. I remember going into our kitchen to cook food so she would eat and seeing pipes and burnt spoons on the counter. As a teenager she would trick me into thinking that we could practice driving so I could get my license. When in reality, she would be flagging people down the street asking if they had any drugs she could buy. Few years later, she was put in a psychiatric hospital. She had called the police telling them to stop following her and bugging her house. She was arrested and placed in a psychiatric facility and diagnosed with schizophrenia. She was later court ordered to stay in a half way house. After her time was up, she decided that she never needed help and was able to walk out freely without anyone stopping her. 

Anosognosia has serious consequences. I‚Äôve watched my family members step away from her like the plague because they became so angry with her that she wouldn‚Äôt admit that she needed help or believed that she was doing it on purpose for attention. They convinced themselves that she would somehow ‚Äúsnap out of it.‚Äù 

Here‚Äôs my main point in all of this, if a person does not think that they need help they will NOT get treatment. In coping with my own mental issues, forcing anyone to do something they hate is far worse for our mental health. Instead of fighting it, accept it for what it is  Stop putting these expectations on us that are unrealistic. Sometimes we don‚Äôt need help in the way you think is best.

Yes, of course it‚Äôs a choice when life is going well for you because your baseline is already happy. It‚Äùs actually EASY to choose happiness when you‚Äôre already happy.

But when you are facing a hardship in life or you are feeling depressed- You are not waking up to sunshine and rainbows and butterflies everyday. Choosing happiness might not be in the cards for you when you‚Äôre struggling just to make it through the day. And that might not seem fair, especially when you see the people around you enjoying life and living so lightly.

But believe it or not, the struggles you are faced with are fair because in the end they are a damn GIFT. It may not feel like it now, it feels horrible and heartbreaking and hopeless. But slowly but surely each day will get better and you will get through it and become a stronger person.

I thought I didn't have anything to live for, I'm not in a relationship, I don't have a good relationship with my family, due to my mental illness I have cut ties and pushed everyone out of my life. I don't even have a pet.
But, I realized, I do have something to live for, which is myself. I want to live a life that is kind, bright, and warm. I want to have a future, I don't care if it's even alone, I just want to be happy and loved, even if it's only by myself. Not only am I working to get better, I am looking forward to when I am better. 
So sorry for the corny post, but I wanted to talk to someone and get this off my chest. I know in the future there will be days where I won't agree with what I said here, but I believe it today and that is what matters. So happy birthday to me and thanks for reading. Even though I don't know all of you, I love you and wish you happiness.",mentalhealth
1612776020.0,Why does venting to friends feels selfish and manipulative? Is it wrong?,"These days I have just been going through a lot and I feel so alone and sad. I feel like there is no one I can talk to. Everytime I feel like maybe talking to my friends it just feels like I am being selfish. And I also feel like they might not be able to know what to do, so why should I just ruined the mood like that? I so want to talk to someone, but I hate feeling like I am using people or being an inconvenience to them. I hate bringing sadness to others.

She knew i cut myself and asked me to show her the cuts and after some mental preparation i did and she took my arm and caressed and kissed the cuts and scars.
After that and she gave me a kiss on the cheek and because I hadn't felt that nice for a long time i started crying and she made me promise to try and get better for my sake.
As a start i think that is difficult but she actually made me want to stop cutting because i now know that my actions can have consequences on her as well. It may be a small start but it's a start. Baby steps",mentalhealth
1603159811.0,"After more than 2 years working on a relationship with a person suffering with mental illness, I can say I've reached a place where we both feel deeply happy and in love"," I have a 2 year long relationship with someone diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder. Things have been very hard in the past, but right now, I feel really happy on my relationship and I do envision a long term future with this person. I don't exactly know why I am writing this, but since I feel like sharing a little of my story with the world, I thought it might be useful to someone to read my statement about my experience and journey to where I am now.

Things were really hard in the beginning. My partner was very unstable and deeply depressed, simple things like sleeping or eating were herculean tasks to him that demanded a lot. Huge anxiety was easily triggered, that led to paranoid and intrusive thoughts, specially at night. Sometimes it lasted a couple of days, sometimes it lasted weeks, or a month. I really felt like on the more ""happy"" and stable days I had to take the best advantage out of it so that he felt like ""coming back"" from the pit hole was worth it. I felt like every time we cycled back into a depressive episode he was further and further away from me. I knew I couldn't really do much more than support him and maintain the bare minimum communication he allowed me to have with him but I just kept insisting and insisting because I thought that if I stopped doing so he would just detach completely from everything and everyone.

It was rough. Sometimes the emotional distance between us was so big that I thought I was in love with a man that would never love me. I felt neglected emotionally a lot of the times because I was supporting everything I could but I couldn't really have that back because my partner was living in a ""survival"" mode. When he became more willing to share, our communication also improved, he shared more with me and I learned how to help him better and also how to help myself to not take things too personally sometimes. Also, therapy and medical treatment were of main importance for his progress of course. There's no partner that can cure an illness, it can make it less difficult, for sure, but only the right treatment can really make it better. Fast forward to nowadays my partner works a full time job with quite some responsibility, he has plans for the future with me, he's stable, for the most part, he keeps his medical and therapy appointments on check, and he's happy. I wouldn't be with anyone else but him. I'm more confident than I have ever been, for the first time I feel someone truly sees me. and values me. We're both on our early 20s and starting our careers, I hope we can move in together in the near future, of course there are still bad times, but I do think we are more prepared now to manage the hard times.

I love him deeply, I'm so so proud of him for overcoming so much and that he's no longer suicidal. I am beyond happy he hang on long enough to embrace the person he's becoming and let himself love and be loved too. There's no better feeling in the world than just laying on his chest listening to his heart beating at night before falling asleep, I now it sounds very cheesy, but it's really the truth for me, it does feel like heaven.

If you're on a relationship going with a hard time understanding and dealing with your partner's mental health, I don't mean with this that you should stay and that you should endure all of it because I know how brutal and lonely it can be. Mental illness is devastating for the ones suffering with it, but also to others close to them. On a relationship, it can indeed became unhealthy for both parts to stay together, so, by no means I believe that the answer is always to stay. I only want to say that sometimes, it takes time and work, but things do get better, a lot better.",mentalhealth

Couldn't find a place to actually hang from so it was more like intentional strangulation because I was just kind of sitting on the floor of the closet with my back against the door.

I've posted about my situation here before, and to be honest I'm extremely surprised I made it this long. But when my own mother's response to knowing I am suicidal is to tell me not to get the carpets dirty, I'm feeling like it's time to cash out.

We came to the conclusion together, that I am fed up of being judged, and wanna change that and the hypocracy in my family. I just don't know how.

I have always found it hard to reach out for help, always worrying about being a burdon to others, even when they said they were open.

Around March I had gotten back from a class trip which I had made some friends, opened up to people, and had a great going social life, something I always struggle with. But as you know what happened in March had some different plans.

My school was closed off, the only way I had contact to these people, I had a couple friends numbers, but didn‚Äôt really see them and drifted a bit apart.

I was plunged back into a state of loneliness I felt like I had no one, I still had peoples contact info, but being autistic means I extremely struggle with reaching out. This caused me to spiral

Thoughts of un worth, fear, and trapped filled me. I was a shell.

It came to a head when after long suffering I thought, this needs to end. I walked out of my room wondering the quickest, and painless way to end it.

I looked over and saw something, my German shepherd chilling on his bean bag. I curled up on the bag and vented, cried, and he just listened.

1611308721.0,I cleaned my appartment and invited someone over!,"I struggle with anxiety and depression, I haven't eat a proper meal (only bread and crisps) in a whole week because I can't gather the courage to cook, I just lay in bed all day doing nothing (it's even too hard to watch TV shows, or youtube videos) and only get up to pee and smoke cigarettes.

Two days ago I had a phone call with my psychiatrist, she increased my meds again and gave me a few recommendations. Among them, she suggested I see a friend IRL. I don't have any friends in the city where I study, only an acquaintance from my marine biology courses.

Just after hanging up with my psychiatrist, I sent this acquaintance a weird message, proposing her to come over. I'm not really sure why but she accepted, and even seemed happy!

So yesterday, even if I didn't really feel like it, I cleaned my whole appartment, put on nice clothes, and I even went grocery shopping (I usually hate that, it drains too much of the few energy I have lol).

She came on the afternoon. We made some snacks together, and ate them watching a movie. I had feared a lot it would be awkward because we don't know each other a lot, but it was really fun!

I was super exhausted after that (and went directly to sleep at 6pm, oops), but also super glad I did it!

And in bonus, I had some snacks leftovers I ate for diner (when I woke up at 11pm, but still), and a clean appartment!

1589281781.0,Driving around for hours listening to Nine Inch Nails and getting pulled over by the military police has been an oddly enlightening experience.,"I'd even go so far as to say spiritual, and I do *not* consider myself spiritual or religious (anymore).

I was feeling like shit today, borderline suicidal, and since I'm living with my parents for the time being, I had to get out of the house to feel through my emotions in private. And it was just... the most compelling feeling of peace I've experienced in a long time. Something about the music throbbing while I drove through a really heavy fog, only car on the road, with the streetlights glowing pretty colors through the mist, just got my thoughts flowing freely again.

I won't jump the gun and say I'm cured, but I did just resist some self destructive habits once I got home, and I'm now doing the coursework that I've been putting off at risk of failing out of school because I *just. didn't. have the energy for it*... So even if I wake up next week and I'm worse off and I feel silly for being optimistic, at least I got a precious window of peace and lucidity that helped me to at least pass the semester.

Oh, and getting pulled over! So, I was so absorbed with my thoughts, I was doing the drive on autopilot thing - see and react to things like red lights and sudden movements, but not really think about where I'm going. I was just navigating by instinct and I ended up going too far on a road and heading for the military base just outside town. Turns out, military cops don't really like it when you suddenly show up to their gates in the middle of the night with a car full of mysterious boxes (haven't fully unpacked yet), then suddenly freak out, turn around, drive on the wrong side of the road for a minute, then correct yourself and try to leave thinking nobody saw you being silly and stupid.

Anyway, the guy that immediately pulled me over was... just a really, really genuine human. He asked me how my night was going and I just explained the whole thing, the need to get out and clear my head, the reason I was too distracted to see the big ass signs about it being a military base (that's also due to the fog, it was incredibly thick, in my defense). Sounded like an absolute nervous wreck. And he listened. And he was really empathetic, just letting me off with a warning.

The funny thing is, I spent a while beating myself up, thinking ""man, this guy must think I'm some huge kind of stupid weak kid. He's a responsible ass adult, working a job in public safety, and here he is, having to chase down a stupid kid with a panic issue. All because *I* can't properly process my feelings.""

But I considered it for a bit, and I realized that this random cop, who doesn't owe me anything, who's shift I rudely interrupted, saw me in one of my worst states and still had it in him to treat me kindly and *listen* to me. Actually *listen* to what I was going through. And I realized that I haven't been doing that for myself.

Guys, see, I need to treat myself with the same empathy and sincerity that this cop treated me with. I need to listen to myself, and forgive myself \~\~even\~\~ *especially* when I'm in my worst states. Because the only way to leave those states is with love and support, and 90% of the time, when I'm not lucky enough to have this cop around, I need to provide that love and support for myself.  I think, for the first time in a long time, I can cut the cynicism for one little moment and tell myself *it's gonna be okay...* and actually mean it.",mentalhealth

1607556464.0,"""Your child, your rules"" is single-handedly the most stupid saying I have ever heard","Now, I am speaking from experience when I say that this statement does wayyyyyy more harm than it ever did good. My mother is an abusive POS, father was even worse before he was divorced. Routinely, I would go to over to videos on subreddits and just watch some posts there. I recently saw a post about parenting, and people in the comments all had the same general consensus that ""your child, your rules""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Problem is, no one really gets all the possible ways that this could be applied. Sure, it is usually used for logical stuff like what religion the child is associated with or maybe whether the child is a vegetarian or a meat-eater. But have you thought this saying through? You're saying that it is this person's child, and that they should be able to make the rules. You are putting this person on one of the most dangerous power trips ever. Now, what would you do if you found out this person over/underfeeds their child? What if they feed the child too much junk, or strictly healthy foods without letting them have any junk food? What would you do if, whenever the child speaks up, they shut them down and go on a tangent before mentioning ""I'm your parent!""? Now do you see where I'm coming from? Look, that was pretty much my story, so I hope you really listen to what I'm saying. I'm 15 years old and I could tell you that shit is damaging. I don't need anyone going through something similar because people keep using this idiotic statement.   


  
And yes, I know this sounds like a giant hyperbole, but it really isn't. Think about it, if you're living with the mentality that ""this is my child, I set the rules for them and no one else"" you are most likely going to turn out as an abusive/narcissistic parent. It's a terrible lesson to be spreading on these subreddits, and are most of the time not even warranted. Being a parent means nothing more than you contributed to the birth and growth of this child, and you are not at all entitled to jack shit if you betray that initial trust. Respect is a two way street, regardless of who you are.",mentalhealth

1561633716.0,You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?,"I remember feeling pretty smart when I was a kid. Maybe that's just how all kids feel but that's what I remember ‚Äì getting better grades than most other kids. During my teenage years I didn't work very hard and still got good grades. I even got accepted into a school that only took on students that got good grades. That's when things started to change. Everyone seemed so much smarter than me and it was really scary. I went from feeling like one of the smartest guys in the room to the dumbest ‚Äì and I'd let myself know just how dumb I was, beating myself up.

Soon, I wasn't just stupid, I was boring. Then I was ugly and weak and pathetic in the eyes of everyone. I felt like I was getting dumber. A brain fog had permeated my mind ‚Äì I couldn't think as fast. My grades slipped as I worked even less and started playing video games more. Gaming takes up your attention and the thoughts more or less stop.

I still managed to get into a decent university but I was ashamed of my accomplishment because all my classmates were moving on to much more prestigious ones. I lasted two and a half years at uni before the suicidal thoughts started to become a real plan. Scared, friendless and far from home, I decided not to go through with it one night ‚Äì the worst night of my life. Instead I called my mom late that night and early the next morning I was on a train home.

Since then, I've been living with my mom. I work as a waiter and the job sees a high staff turnover with a majority of people working there being students trying to earn some money in between their studies. I can feel them judging me when I tell them that it's all I do ‚Äì I'm not doing this part time while I chase my dreams. I don't have anything else going on. I'm a 25yo man living with his mom and working a minimum wage job.

I got help, of course ‚Äì talking to some professionals and taking pills ‚Äì but the thoughts never really left. I know I'm not supposed to indulge them. My therapist told me, *you wouldn't say those things to your best friend so why would you say them to yourself?* I would reply that my best friend isn't trying to sabotage and fuck up my life. But I was never trying to do that and yet I felt like I deserved to hear the the things I was telling myself and deserved the life I now had because of how stupid and pathetic I was.

Recently, after doing something stupid but totally forgivable and human, I googled 'Is it possible to get dumber?' The first result was the question: *Is it psychologically possible to get dumber* on Quora. One of the answers by Norma Pellett:

> My experience tells me yes. I know a woman who was articulate and educated. I moved away and saw her again after ten years. She had no opinions of her own and couldn't articulate a decent sentence.

> I asked other friends if she had been ill or in an accident. No, she hadn't. Then I heard her husband talking to her. He called her ‚Äùstupid‚Äù and told her what she was doing was idiotic. He berated her for several more minutes. She was so cowed by this abuse that she bought into his assessment of her intelligence.
> She became what he expected her to be.
> I was too young and unsure of myself to call him on it or even to try to find a way to help her. I am ashamed that I didn't do anything.
> I'm not even sure that thirty years ago people really thought of emotional abuse as abuse. There were no bruises or broken bones, but this was much worse.
> Don't spend any time with someone who puts you down ‚Äî not even if they say, ‚Äújust kidding‚Äù or ‚Äúcan't you take a joke?‚Äù Months and years of this ‚Äúhumor‚Äù can destroy anyone.

Abuse is a terrible thing and I don't want to diminish it or its victims but I couldn't help but compare the husband to the voice in my head. The abuse I put myself through. I imagine having another person tell you those things is a thousand times worse.

I have always thought that a smart person was smart no matter what. That they may not believe it and people might tell them otherwise but they were, unchangeably, smart. Maybe it's obvious to everyone else but it never occurred to me that people could become the person they were told they are. That their personality could be moulded. What my therapist should have told me is *You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?* Thinking of it that way it's hard to feel like I deserve it. There is not a person in the world that I believe deserves abuse.

So how to stop? It's important not to try telling yourself the opposite of the things you usually tell yourself. I'm not going to look in the mirror every day and tell myself I'm smart, confident, handsome etc. That just feels inauthentic and quite silly. What you have to do instead is learn to recognise the thoughts and externalize them ‚Äì think of them as not your own but rather your anxiety's or your depression's. Your illness is your own personal abuser. Then the next step will be to stop believing the thoughts by not giving them your attention. Don't think the opposite or try to argue with them (e.g. *I'm not ugly I'm beautiful*) instead, try to refocus on whatever it is you were doing. This is hard but can get easier with practice. Mindfulness meditations help. You can even try talking back to the thoughts as though you aren't taking them seriously, *Thanks anxiety, tell me that again! C'mon that's what you always say. Ha, that's a good one. I was hoping you were going to show up.*

I feel so far behind everyone else but I'm going to really try getting better this time.",mentalhealth
1561297943.0,I think people who make jokes/say that people need to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or ‚Äúgrow a pair‚Äù or ‚Äúbe a man‚Äù are part of the problem.,"


My friend tried to commit suicide last night. I watched him drive away in his car drunk and he went on the highway/motorway saying he didn‚Äôt care if he died. Tried to stop him but couldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs not the issue though. 

I had no idea he was suicidal, his family had no idea he was suicidal, his friends had no idea. He‚Äôd kept his mouth shut and let these feelings fester. 

The conversation about male mental health is nowhere near what it needs to be. It is heading in the right direction sure, but at the moment it only seems to be a big deal when someone is on the brink of suicide or having severe depression. 

There is no emphasis on normal day to day life, people telling young boys to man up if they are upset. Saying be a man. This is vile behaviour and forces boys to stuff down their feelings and deal with it through anger since they feel they can‚Äôt talk it through. Even saying it to girls shows them that this is how they should act and that boys should act differently when it comes to feelings. 

In the US four times as many suicides are by males. 9% have daily anxiety or depression. Of those 9% only a quarter found help for it according to the national health survey 2010-13
Source: https://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/12/numbers

In the UK 76% of suicides are carried out by males and 12.5% men are affected by depression. Of the people that seek help through therapy only 36% are men. Then the most shocking stat from the UK, of all the things that kill men under 45, getting hit by a car, murder, heart attacks etc, the leading cause of death is suicide. I am an under 45 male in the UK and to know that the most likely way for me to die statistically is for me to kill myself is shocking and scary. 

Only 15% of men report they would take time off work to focus on mental health. 34% would feel embarrassed or ashamed to do so for a mental health issue compared to the 15% feeling ashamed for a physical injury. 38% would feel that their employer would look down on them for taking time off for a mental health issue compared to the 26% for a physical.

Even among my friends this sort of ‚Äúman up talk‚Äù happens where if a guy gets upset over something deemed trivial he gets told to stop being a girl. I personally am quite sensitive, when I get super angry I tend to tear up. I hate it because it sometimes weakens my argument but it‚Äôs just how I am. When I get angry I tear up. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúsad cry‚Äù I‚Äôm just angry. 

 I had an argument with a close female friend and she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only joking, so stop crying and grow a pair, man up‚Äù. That says my feelings aren‚Äôt allowed because I‚Äôm male, because apparently I‚Äôm not supposed  to feel that way. I should be calm and collected at all times. But all that does is make my squash my feelings away and deal with them some other way. 

That other way can turn into depression and eventually suicide. 

We need to change the mental health conversation so that it‚Äôs not a conversation about men on the brink of suicide. I‚Äôm aware that it isn‚Äôt only aimed there but at the moment to me it feels like not enough is focused on males feeling  like they *can* talk their problems through with people.",mentalhealth

Just about one year ago, my OCD caused me to suffer (another) complete mental and emotional breakdown/collapse, culminating in an unsuccessful suicide attempt.

I spent every waking and sleeping moment in bed, trying to escape the confines of my own mind. I would go a week without showering, wearing the same sweats and t-shirt every day. I very nearly attempted suicide again.

Before the day I ""broke"", I had emptied my dresser and closet, and did a giant wash of almost every item of everyday wear I owned, clothes for all seasons. And for the next year, they lay in assorted baskets strewn across the laundry room, untouched and unexplored. I've started coming around to stability and normality over the past month, and today decided to finally take a step out of the darkness, and fold my god damn laundry.

1604675002.0,My Parents Punished me for Having PTSD," I had been sexually abused by my grandfather for 3-4 years, literally all of my early childhood - I do not have a single memory before him abusing me. My parents found out after constantly punishing me for masturbating (in my room), wetting the bed, having outbursts, etc. There was legal action taken, I was in counseling for the bare minimum time. 

 I had horrible nightmares, night terrors, I sleptwalked. My parents literally punished me for getting out of bed and waking my mom (who was a stay at home mom with all of her kids being in school for 8 hours out of the day) up because I had nightmares that made me feel terrified, paralyzed, and unable to go back to sleep. 

 On one specific occasion, I remember being in the 3rd or 4th grade (only 1-2 years after the abuse had ended) and waking my mom up because I had a nightmare about dolls trying to kill me. My parents were so mad that my dad made me sleep with the light on in an attempt to make it where I couldn't sleep, when I did fall asleep that night he came in and intentionally woke me up telling me I didn't deserve to be asleep, I was going to learn a lesson about waking my mom up, and that he hoped I didn't sleep all night (I had school the next morning). On top of all of that, they made me stay home from a party that everyone else got to go to (my mom stayed home with me). When they got back my sister had brought me candy, he said I wasn't allowed to have it. He also made a point of saying how everyone asked where I was and he told EVERYONE why I couldn't be there, and he made me feel guilty for my mom not being able to go and having to stay home. 

  I confronted my mom about it today (I'm 24) and she just immediately started saying the typical, ""Oh yeah we get it, we're terrible parents, your childhood was terrible."" She then kept saying I never told them I was having nightmares even though I remember ALWAYS telling them about my nightmares and the only time I didn't get punished was the night I had a nightmare about someone shooting my family because that was deemed realistic enough to be afraid. I told her all I wanted her to do was apologize and she full out said she will never apologize and to leave her alone.

  I got frustrated and sarcastically asked if they were never told I would have PTSD after being abused my entire childhood, she said no. So I asked if they seriously didn't have enough common sense to think maybe their child was traumatized and she said no. 

  My parents were so focused on making me ""normal"" that they traumatized me worse than that abuse ever did and they won't even acknowledge that they did anything wrong.",mentalhealth

A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness,

If you are reading this as one of **many** who doesn‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs like to deal with mental illness, I am very happy you don‚Äôt experience firsthand what I and so many others have to experience on a daily basis because...

**I would not wish this pain on my worst enemy.**

**I am so happy** you don‚Äôt have to experience feeling that no one in your life truly loves or cares about you, despite them reassuring you that they do on almost a daily basis.

**I am so happy** you haven‚Äôt had to answer any of the further questions that follow ‚Äúdo you feel anxious or depressed?‚Äù when visiting the doctor‚Äôs office.

**I am so happy** you have never thought the world is better without you in it.

If you have never had to leave a party because of a sudden wave of anxiety or sadness, *I really hope it stays that way.*

If you are able to get out of bed without feeling nauseous with anxiety or the weight of depression, *appreciate it* every single day**.**

**Don‚Äôt ever take it for granted.**

Don‚Äôt let a day go by without appreciating how *beautiful* life is and can be. Because many of us, myself included, aren‚Äôt always able to see that beauty, no matter how hard we try.

While mental illness is something that is so wrongfully romanticized in the movies, **it is very ugly in real life.** Mental illness is not **‚Äúquirky‚Äù** or **‚Äúpoetic‚Äù** like society makes it seem on social media.

Being mentally ill isn‚Äôt *aesthetic worthy,* mascara filled tears with sad music in the background; mental illness is barely being able to keep up basic personal hygiene because it feels almost physically **impossible** to get out of bed. 

**Mental illness makes the world seem pointless.** 

So when a loved one approaches you seeking comfort or a listening ear, please don‚Äôt automatically assume it is an annoying cry for attention. Because I promise you, that assumption is our **worst fear.**

**The last thing we wish for is to be a burden on the ones we love.**

Isn‚Äôt it ironic that even when we are struggling, our first thought is to not make our loved ones uncomfortable?

And when we cancel plans or fail to stay around the entirety of a social outing, don‚Äôt take it personally.Trust me, we already beat ourselves up for it enough already because we finally put ourselves first for once, even though that is what we should‚Äôve been doing all along. 

When we isolate ourselves from you and push you away, don‚Äôt think it is us being rude. We are just trying to do what we can to feel like we aren‚Äôt dragging you down with us.

Please do not blame us for the cards we got dealt, we deal with them the best we are able to, even if it means pushing loved ones away to avoid getting hurt. 

Most of all, see mental illness as you would any broken bone or any physical sickness.**It hurts just as bad and is equally out of our control.**So, while we don‚Äôt wish you would first handedly understand, we want you to **be patient** and understand the best you are able to.

**We are fighting an invisible illness that we aren‚Äôt always sure we can beat.**

However, even with this ongoing battle to stay afloat in our own minds filled with endless thoughts, **not every single day is a bad one.** 

In fact, we go through periods of time where everything feels alright again for a while. So when those good days finally come around, we appreciate it and never take it for granted. 

Because to those who struggle with mental illness, it is a privilege to feel the true happiness that **everyone** deserves to feel every day.

Sincerely,

The mentally ill",mentalhealth
1579300993.0,We are asking Congress to take action on the mental health crisis in America.,"Hey guys,

We are a group of high school students who are committed to solving the mental health issues of today through awareness and policy. The mental health crisis is one of the most prevalent issues facing the American population today, not only the youth. 

We are also compiling a list of candidate endorsements who are pledging to focus on mental health reform once they are inaugurated.

In fact, 1 in 5 American adults experience some form of mental illness each year (National Alliance on Mental Illness), while only 41% receive proper treatment (Mental Health First Aid). This is unacceptable, and we demand action now.

We‚Äôve witnessed these problems in our own schools and neighborhoods, and we believe it is time for us as a country to step up and pass bold solutions to protect everyday people. 

We are also asking you to sign and share our petition (https://www.change.org/p/u-s-congress-pass-comprehensive-mental-health-legislation-now ) to ask Congress and the President to commit to comprehensive mental health reform to ensure that everyone has access to quality mental health care.

Thank you.

1564554589.0,My 9-year-old is madly obsessed with me. Any advice?,"&#x200B;

At first it seemed very cute and sweet, like a ‚ÄúCrush‚Äù sort of thing. Through this past few years it has been escalating to a point where it is creepy and I fear for her mental health and future safety. I‚Äôm telling this story as a way of trying to get some opinions. 

Let‚Äôs call her Cindy, she is a daughter of a cousin of mine who I am not that close to, but we still get along pretty well. I‚Äôm going to share some anecdotes so you all can see what I mean. 

We come from a family where reunions and parties are common and happen at least once a month. So, we all see each other frequently. Cindy always wants to be around me, she wants me to play with her and hold her every minute of every single reunion. Whenever I dare to hug, say hi, or even acknowledge any other member of the family (especially when it comes to younger females of the family) she would get upset and throw a tantrum, running away onto the streets. Whenever the family starts dancing outside (which is pretty often lol) Cindy makes me pick her up and dance with her. I can only dance with her, no other female is allowed near me, I can‚Äôt even put her down to go the bathroom or have a drink. And whenever I did put her down well‚Ä¶ temper tantrum time. 

She once smacked her youngest sister (Mia, 2-year-old) so hard it almost knocked her out, just because she was walking around the house, spotted me, smiled, and wanted to get close to say hi. 

Anytime another female of the family would bring me something to eat or drink, she would make me give it back or throw it away so she could go and bring me whatever I had just been given. 

One time I did not show up to one of those reunions because some other plan that sounded more fun came around (dick move I know). Cindy asked everyone a thousand times where I was, and why I wasn‚Äôt showing up. Eventually they got tired of her and decided to call me, I explained that I was hanging out with some friends. When they told her about this, she got furious, grabbed a stone and threw it at the nearest car, breaking one of the windows. She then locked herself up inside one of the rooms. 

3 or 4 times a week, Cindy‚Äôs mom would call me, telling me Cindy wanted me to come over so I could help her with her homework. Sometimes, her other sister (8-year-old) would ask for my help too, causing Cindy to flip out, throw things at her, and call her names. Whenever I refused the invitation to help Cindy with her hw, she would start ripping her notebooks and textbooks, or pouring water on them. 

She then started to force her parents to bring her to my place every other day, even if it was for a short visit. This One time they left her with me because they needed someone to watch her to do some errands. Cindy was in my room, and I left for a couple of minutes to get her some snacks. When I came back, I found her going thru my clothes. She started crying and said she wanted to steal one of my t-shirts so she could remember me with it. I thought it was kind weird, but cute in a way. I told her she could have one of her choosing. Each time she came over after that she demanded a new shirt to take. I told her I couldn‚Äôt give her anymore shirts because I don‚Äôt have many. (which is true) Every time she would come, we would have the exact same conversation, until, without me noticing, she took pretty much all my shirts and stuffed them inside her backpack. Her mother had to come back the next day and give them back. 

I used to play along and not say much to her or her mother because, like I said, I thought it just was a ‚Äúcrush‚Äù or just a little girl overly attached to an older family member. It escalated gradually to a point which I didn‚Äôt know what to do. And besides, I‚Äôm really not into confrontation, so I didn‚Äôt want to cause any trouble. 

Last time I saw Cindy was this past weekend. (another family reunion) but this time, I brought my new girlfriend with me (she was my best friend for 6 years but I escaped the friendzone haha). Cindy was using crutches because she had gotten injured doing something or other while at school, so she couldn‚Äôt follow me around like she usually does. 

Obviously, she got furious when she met my girlfriend, but she didn‚Äôt say much. She sat right between us and didn‚Äôt let us kiss, hug or dance. Laura (my gf) Went to grab a drink for both of us, and immediately Cindy started moving around so she was occupying the rest of the sofa. When Laura came back, she refused to move and let her sit. I lost my patience (even when I lose my patience, I‚Äôm still pretty chill) and told her that she was being mean to my GF and that meant she was also being mean to me. I also told her we (Me and Laura) would have to leave if she kept it up.

Cindy lost it, she started screaming and kicking, she called Laura every name in the book and finished by saying that if we continued being together, she would shoot us both with his father‚Äôs gun. Turns out my cousin is not very bright, and it took her this long to realize something might be wrong with her daughter. My cousin pulled me aside and I told her everything, everything I just told you and a lot more. I advised her to seek help for Cindy and told her it was best if I stayed away for a while. 

Im really worried about Cindy and her wellbeing. So please, if anyone has gone thru something similar, or if some of you understand what is going on and what can I do to help. I would gladly listen. 

Thank you. Ps. English is not my first language so sorry if some of the writing is gibberish.",mentalhealth

1619095873.0,Is it just me or does life just feel like shit,"Honestly, lately life has just felt well lifeless.  


People are angry at each other from all over the globe. Whether if it's because of politics, the pandemic, race, cops, etc. It just feels like everywhere people are just angry. If they aren't angry then they are most likely depressed given the state of the world and what's been going on. When you think of all those things together it really makes you feel like life has been shit and still is.   


The folks on the news always seem like they are either angry at something or have something negative to talk about. The people around me are uneasy with what's been going on. Jobs have been hard to come by when taking the pandemic into consideration. If you don't want to work with other people because you are scared of the virus that's a huge chunk of jobs you can't get. Even if you get a job it's been tough trying to get a place to live comfortably. The folks I know that have a place either work 90% of their week, have two jobs or are unable to treat themselves because they can't afford to.  


The most frustrating about all this is the lack of attention mental health has been getting. At least on a national level.  All you hear is cases and deaths with very few articles mentioning mental health. When you do they are actually talking about people who have Covid or have had Covid are experiencing depression. Like you can't have mental health issues without Covid? What kind of nonsense is that? Vaccines came out which you would think is something we should be hopeful for the news tries to scare people with ""hesitancy may stop us from going back to normal"".   


Anyways that's all I have to say. I do really hope it gets better, but lately the longer the pandemic drags on I feel it's just going to make people worse and worse. Both mentally and physically.",mentalhealth

Most are nice and well meaning people but absolutely clueless and often shocked when people have problems in there.

I remembered once a group of ladies were sitting with some of the staff and chatting about stuff, and another patient was crying hard and obviously having a problem. The staff just pretended to not see what was happening and kept chatting with the old ladies.

Any kind of therapy was aimed at the lowest common denominator, and that's understand but also useless. It was maybe playing word games or reading the safety rules. Nothing helpful.

1692438068.0,I wish people understood or cared about the psychological damage of small penis shaming.,"Growing up a boy, society repeatedly makes sure you understand a few things about being a man. On for those things is that a man is supposed to be big. Both in height, but especially in penis size. You see that any man who's small is to be treated with ridicule and scorn. And you see that men with big penis are treated with admiration and praise.

It's been 7 years since mine was referred to as a ""*pencil dick*"" by a woman (not to my face, but to a friend who thought I should know). I don't wanna go into the personal depression spiral I went through, being convinced I was sexually unlovable, but I will say it's not 7 years since, and I'm still deathly afraid of getting naked with a woman. I just don't feel safe.

I know the world will never change. No matter what forms of body shaming become publicly wrong to do, small penis shaming will remain a good, popular and acceptable form if body shaming. So my struggle is maintaining some form of self -worth, when I'm constantly reminded how worthless and inadequate having a small penis makes a man, when I hear people laughing at small penis jokes, as if it really does make us deserving of ridicule.",mentalhealth

It will be worth it, I promise.

Afterwards, drop a comment or hit reply to share how it felt.

**Before you do this mirror exercise read this**

* Find a mirror where you can be alone and undisturbed
* Then look at yourself. Really, look into your eyesNo preening, no posing
* Breathe slowlyUnclench your jaw
* Ease your shoulders down
* Unclench your toesOne more breath

Now say to yourself:

>I love you  
>  
>I am going to take care of you  
>  
>You're going to be OK

Yes, you can say it out loud.

No overthinking. Just do it.

**How did it feel?**

How did you see yourself?

Did you feel any tenderness towards the face in the mirror?

Did it feel strange or emotional, or just indifferent?

I don't know about you, but I felt like crying. In a good way.

It felt emotional and tender. Like a step towards accepting and loving myself.

I saw myself as a little vulnerable, but felt lighter afterwards. Like I was going to be OK.

I (24f) was raped by my own cousin for over a year when I was 14 years old. Story started with force, him moving my hand, forcing my head down, holding me down, locking me in cars, etc. Same things that are pretty common with those raped by family members. What I want to talk about is the aftermath. What nobody really realizes. My virginity wasn‚Äôt lost the same way as my friends growing up, I felt my body was meant to be used because that‚Äôs all he told me I was good for. So I believed him. After having that happen to you for that long you begin to go numb. It starts out with fighting then when you realize there isn‚Äôt anything you can do after fighting screaming and clawing you way out for months you just give in and want to get it over with. I don‚Äôt feel like my body is mine, I don‚Äôt have a connection with sex. I hear stories of people having sexual partners because they are in love or want to share that with their partners, but I have always viewed sex as my duty. It was my job to make men feel nice, I never had a right to say no. Still feel like I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt have connections with people, every friend I push away because I don‚Äôt ‚Äúfit in‚Äù with them. I‚Äôm disconnected from what your typical 24 year old would want to do (drink, party, yoga, etc) my focus for the time I‚Äôve grown up is to just make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again. Survivor mentality if you will... I‚Äôm not saying all this to feel sorry for myself. It happens to a lot of people. But what happened to me made me feel like a outcast, I can‚Äôt share ‚Äúlosing my virginity‚Äù stories because it wasn‚Äôt funny or cute. I can‚Äôt stay in relationships with... well anyone because I don‚Äôt trust people because if family can hurt me in that way what‚Äôs to stop others. I don‚Äôt talk to friends (don‚Äôt have any), I‚Äôve lost a lot of my family due to what happened and the family I haven‚Äôt lost like my mom, dad, and brother I don‚Äôt talk to them anymore because they don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôve changed so much from the happy go lucky ‚Äúpretty teenage girl‚Äù to the cold hearted one I am today. Nobody can help you but yourself. I‚Äôve been told over and over again to ‚Äújust get over it‚Äù but here we are, 10 years later. And I‚Äôm over what happened to me, it doesn‚Äôt haunt me like it use to. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt permanently change me. My ability to form relationships, my mentality, my hobbies, my happiness, or my thought processes all have been changed because of one person 10 years ago. So for those that have been raped, you don‚Äôt have to just get over it, you don‚Äôt have to just bury it, but you can build because of it. I‚Äôm a strong person because of it, just isolated. So if you guys have any questions like how to help those that have been through it I will try to answer to the best of my abilities as another survivor. Thanks for reading.

1620968441.0,My cat is the biggest reason why I am sticking around,"I‚Äôve always had anxiety and big depresso my entire life. Started on meds 3 years ago, felt stabilized. But then the pandemic struck and every thing went downhill... it was like spiralling into a dark hole. 

I was never allowed to have cats growing up, although I am a huge cat lover. My parents thought they were stinky, no-good animals. At the beginning of 2021 I felt this huge void that needed to be filled by an animal. A furry companion that would give me a purpose in life to be its care-taker. To make me interested in living again. So I adopted my cat, Pepper.

My parents were absolutely livid. It was probably the worst week of my life, they were yelling at me. Telling me I just need to ‚Äúbe strong‚Äù and get over my depression. I felt like a bad person because I disobeyed their house rules. But it was getting to the point where I wanted to die really bad. My meds were upped, I started taking a new pill but the sadness still kept creeping in through the cracks. 

Sometimes I think about admitting myself to a hospital but I think about how I need to be here for him. I want the best life for my boy, he‚Äôs been spoiled with so much love, toys, treats, and a tall kitty condo. Everyday I look forward to waking up to feed him or give him pets. 

Pepper might not know it, but his existence is everything to me.

But I am completely miserable and I don‚Äôt want to waste the years that are supposed to be the best part of my life, waking up everyday and having to do things I don‚Äôt care about. 

How do I make my everyday life more enjoyable. I want to live a life I enjoy living.

Not only does she brighten my mood just by being the best dog I‚Äôve ever had, but she helps me through panic attacks, and keeps me from harming myself(I punch and hit myself in the legs and head). I never had to teach her anything, she picked it up all on her own. 

Also, Sandi is one of the only reasons I leave the house, other than work.

I take her on two walks everyday, and the fresh air and little bit of exercise have done wonders for me. My appetite is back up, I‚Äôm sleeping better, and my body is starting to feel healthier.

However, the one message I sent him asking ‚Äúis there plans we made for this weekend that I forgot about?‚Äù, he has yet to respond to. It‚Äôs been six hours since he was last active according to Facebook messenger. 

My panic attack started when I had this insane thought ‚Äúwas he out all night boozing around getting frisky/messing with other women?‚Äù. My heart started racing, my mind was running wild, I started to breathe heavier and heavier. I was in this state for about 30 minutes trying to remain calm. 

Finally, I took a deep breath and thought to myself: ‚ÄúIf he didn‚Äôt cheat on me, I‚Äôm worked up for no reason. If he DID cheat, I will deal with him later.‚Äù There was nothing I could do at that point in time, because he either did or didn‚Äôt do anything.

1627255281.0,I Worry About This Sub,"Day after day, night after night I scroll through my feed to catch up quick and I see so many posts on this sub, mostly genuine people looking for encouragement, empathy, or just to know they're not alone. But looking for that something, that one thing that's gonna turn their struggle around. 

Sometimes a particular post will catch my eye and I'll interact, but for the most part I watch time after time as people, mostly young people, reach out for somebody's hand and no one is there to respond. I don't view this as any one person or group of people's fault, I just think the sheer numbers of those looking for real help overwhelm the number of people qualified and/or willing enough to provide it by such a large margin that a lot of the sub continually consists of largely ignored cries for help. 

I wonder what impact this has on the greater good that all of us try to do for ourselves or other people when it comes to providing mental health care, referrals, and advice. I wonder if there's a way it could be done better by all of us involved not only with our mental health for one reason or another, but with our specific involvement in the sub.

1587605821.0,My depression took my personality,"During my (f 20) teenage years I dealt with depression. At some point during that, it became all I was. As many people know depression can make you loose interest in things that previously interested you.
I lost all my hobbies and a big chuck of my personality. I was a shell.

I've since overcome that part of my life and am left with this same shell. I dont particularly have anything that makes me me anymore. I don't have the patience/strength to really finish anything I start (eg artwork or writing) and when I don't finish it it brings me down more.

Essentialy I don't have a personality. I think I'm very boring and have crippling social skills. I don't know how I would go about trying to fix this.

My lack of social skills (due to isolating myself through arguably the most important part of my life, development wise) has also resulted in me loosing all my friends and unable to reconcile or make new ones.

I figure I can't be the only one going through this or something similar and wonder why this big part of this mental illness isn't really talked about

I have severe  anxiety about going into new places, that is manageable when I‚Äôm with my boyfriend, but when I‚Äôm by myself.... I just cannot cope. The thought of going to the hospital and having to navigate it myself was far too much. 

My dad got moved to a hospice last Thursday for palliative care. 2 people could now visit at a time! But we were so busy with work.... I had planned on going to visit on the Monday but we received a phone call Sunday evening saying he was now unconscious and likely wouldn‚Äôt wake up. Immediately, we rushed u but he more than likely had no idea we were there.... he passed away on Wednesday. 

If I had gone to the hospital I would‚Äôve been able to tel him one last time that I loved him. Due to COVID I haven‚Äôt hugged this man since February, as even when the restrictions were slackened I didn‚Äôt want to risk passing anything onto a shielding person. If I had went to the hospital I could have wrapped my arms around him one last time. 

But my social anxiety held me back. And now I don‚Äôt know if I can live with myself.

I used the chat line because I get too anxious when i have to talk on the phone and the guy was really helpful and he asked me if i had a plan and I lied and told him no because I was afraid of what would happen if I did tell him that I have a plan to kill myself so I told him that I was just having thoughts of suicide and that I didn't have a plan to kill myself. Then we just talked about what was going on and what's making me feeling this way and then we came up with a plan on what I could do tonight to keep myself distracted and busy and he gave me some coping mechanism that I could use. I talked to him for about 40 minutes and he told my that I could always contact the hotline again if the thoughts comes back. Honestly the suicide hotline did help me this time and I felt a little better after talking with them. So if you're having suicidal thoughts don't be afraid to contact your local suicide hotline it might help and if you have contacted the hotline before and have had a bad experience like I did the first time don't be afraid to try again because it kind of stopped me from doing something really bad tonight.,mentalhealth

1541457166.0,I was finally accurately diagnosed after 12 years thanks to the show 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend'," 

Throwaway account for reasons that may be obvious and a **Spoiler** for season 3 of the show.

Let me start off by giving you guys some backstory. I have been in therapy for a wide array of issues: Compulsive spending, depression, anxiety, manic episodes, suicidal attempts. I attempted many times to get a diagnosis but I wouldn't share any embarrassing details that I will share with you. Every psychiatrist I would see would base these disorders off as the result of childhood trauma and an absent father. I was on all the medications you‚Äôve probably heard of Buspar, Prozac, Xanax, and Zoloft. 

My relationships have never really been stable in both interpersonal and romantic areas. I‚Äôve had 3 romantic relationships my entire life with the longest relationship lasting 6 months. Whenever I developed feelings for someone it would turn into severe infatuation where it went as far as stalking, rearranging my work schedule to be able to interact with him, and try to change my physical appearance in order to get them to fall for me. I am not proud of any of this but I need to stop denying that this was happening. With friendships, whenever a friend would cancel plans like drinks at the bar I would fall into a severe depression where suicidal thoughts would come to mind. I would call these friends and tell them I was considering suicide in order to get them to come see me. 

My manic episodes started getting pretty severe over the past few months to the point where I would take a week off from work and take lavish spontaneous trips to Europe, I started having auditory hallucinations of a ‚Äòsane me‚Äô insulting me and calling me crazy. I would go to Vegas on weekends to go on an alcohol binger and have numerous random sexual encounters. I would also lock myself in my room after work and watch TV for 6 hours straight. I will admit, I was too ashamed to open up about this as I was scared of being institutionalized and being known in my family as the freak.

In August, I wanted to start watching a new show and came across the show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. I had heard of the show before but because of the name I thought it was related to the meme I had grown annoyed of so I never really gave it a chance. As I started watching I was horrified that there were a few similarities between myself and the character Rebecca Bunch, the stalking, lavish spending, fear of abandonment, the hallucinations. The fact that she was the titular ‚ÄúCrazy Ex-Girlfriend‚Äù left me in a slight depression and I almost stopped watching. However when I reached season 3 where Rebecca finally gets diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I decided to finally go to a new psychiatrist to get another opinion and decided not to hold back any information that I was scared would be regarded as ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô people behavior. Thanks to the show‚Äôs portrayal of mental illness, I was finally able to open up about the stalking, the auditory hallucinations, and everything in between. After 12 years of therapy my official diagnosis is Self-Destructive Borderline and while the road to recovery will be a long one, I am hopeful that someday I will be able to completely manage my BPD. If you're currently going through something similar know that you aren't alone and the medical professionals are there to help you not judge you.

TLDR; Was an undiagnosed Borderline for 12 years but thanks to the show‚Äôs portrayal of mental illness I finally opened up about topics I was ashamed to admit, finally getting an accurate diagnosis.",mentalhealth

1616302194.0,I lost it over my son's hair,"Yesterday, I noticed that my son had been chewing on a lock of his hair. No big deal lots of kids do that. I explained why he can't and that we need to trim some of his hair to deal with the damage he did to it. It was pretty torn up in one spot. His is super proud of his long hair. It was down to the middle of his back when it is wet and to his shoulders dry because of his curls. 

My mom when to beauty school years ago and offered to cut it for me. I was very hesitant because my family jokes about cutting his hair behind my back. I told her to only cut it to his shoulders but she gave him basically her hair cut which it the short old lady cut that she and my grandma have. It looks awful and I asked her to stop but she kept insisting that she needed to even it out. 

By the time she was done I was in tears. I ran out to the car to calm down so the kids didn't see me cry. My mom came out and made jokes about how I'm not speaking to her and laughed and asked if she could cut my hair next. 

I took the kids home and fed them and attempted to put his hair in his braids that I always do but it is too short. I had a full meltdown after the kids when to bed and basically hyperventilated on my kitchen floor. I'm so angry that my chest hurts and I asked my son after I was calm what he wanted to do with it and he said ""please, don't take any more of my hair."" I know I'm more upset then he is.

1634819226.0,Did my mom sexually assault me? Its not sexually motivated by it definitely felt violating.,"My mom has always been sadistic towards me. She would drag me by the hair and cut it like a maniac as some punishment then tell me how ugly i look, or she would watch me throwing up on the floor and not help cos I‚Äôm being punished. However, there are instances when i do something that ‚Äúwould dishonour‚Äù the family? She would try to strip me down infront of my own brothers, violently pulling at my clothes while i try to cover myself. One time she told me to get naked and bend over the bed so she could check if my ‚Äúhymen was intact‚Äù. 
I feel nothing but anger tbh, i normalised that behaviour from her so much that it didn‚Äôt bother me after some time, it doesn‚Äôt bother me when someone molests me in public either. I think I achieved that level of apathy and indifference by dissociation myself from my body. I consider my body as a vessel i am in, and when someone hurts or violates it, they are violating the vessel and not me personally. I do feel anger though at her and everything she put me through, so ig i feel smth. Can i call these experiences sexual abuse?



Edit: Thanks for everyone‚Äôs kind words and thanks to everyone who opened up about similar experiences. I wanted to assure everyone that i am 23 now, last time i was sexually abused by her was a couple months prior to leaving the country at 18. I don‚Äôt have to see my family for another year. I wanted to discuss this in therapy but I just couldn‚Äôt find the words to describe it ig, I didn‚Äôt know what to label it as. Now I know what to call it, i can communicate it better in therapy.

about 8 years ago I had a threesome with a married couple who I'd known since we were kids. The deal was he wouldn't be with me but we'd both be with her, which I agreed to. It was a fun night, and afterwards I fell asleep. I woke up some time later with someone spooning me, groping me, and kissing the back of my neck. I tried to push them off, I had no idea who it was or what was happening. When I realized it was the husband I said ""no, please stop"" several times, but he wouldn't listen and kept fighting me. eventually I just gave in. He sodomized me and after he finished made me promise to never tell his wife, Liz. (she had left us alone to go pick someone up at the airport). tbh I never had a lot of self esteem and to say I felt humiliated is an understatement. I didn't want it to happen but I let it happen anyway, i could've protested more maybe if i did it wouldn't of happened. I went home. I was bleeding a lot, one of my roommate noticed and asked me what happened, after a while of her whining I told her and she said ""well that's what you get for whoring around"". 

I accepted what she said, and after that I never told anyone about it, not even my therapists. it's something I try to not dwell over, but when i think about it i feel gross, and sad.

1619188583.0,"I started turning off and locking my phone away every weekend, and it's liberating","This may not apply to everyone. But for me, a person who is severely addicted to instagram and messaging apps, it's just really liberating. I bought this locking device that allows you to lock something in it and set a time for it to reopen (not naming any brand here, everyone please don't make this a post about products). I started out by locking my phone for a few hours, then a whole day, and eventually a whole weekend.

It is surprisingly beneficial to my mental health. I am a hypersensitive type and love to overread and overthink anything anyone say to me. And I also don't have a life. So what happen is that I need to constantly chat with my friends and family, even to the point that may annoy them, and when they show a lil bit of disinterest, even when they are really just busy, I'd literally feel hurt, it sounds so stupid to say such thing as a grown ass person, but yes, and I really hate myself for that.

Once I locked my phone, my brain will immediately try to find substitutes to generate the same stimulation, sometimes I'd use my computer to browse the internet but using the computer just never brings me the same negativity that a phone does, same as how youtube and reddit are somehow just much less toxic than ig and whatsapp to me. I don't play video games and my social circles don't use facebook anymore, so I normally can shut my computer pretty quick because I feel bored again.

And weird enough the next thing I know is that I find myself actually get up from my lazy ass and start doing things like chores, sorting mails and even doing some exercise. I don't think I am anywhere near being mentally healthy, but seriously I am much much better off without that damn phone.

Edit: Sorry guys I can't pm the brand of the device, it's against the rule, you can generally search timed locking box and anything similar will do. There are many boxes that do it.

Edit: The point of this post is really just to put your phone away, and you will instantly feel better once you can detach from the toxicity and focus on yourself.",mentalhealth

1654064006.0,"Are you afraid you'll kill someone/an animal, f*ck your sister, or abuse a child? Consider OCD","I've spent a lot of time scrolling various mental health subs on reddit or other subs that encourage venting or advice-seeking. Sometimes, I come across posts by people who are describing the unthinkable:

They might be afraid they're attracted to a family member, afraid they may be a pedophile, afraid they'll choke their cat, afraid they'll commit homicide. 

In almost all of these posts, I can clearly tell what they are describing is undiagnosed OCD. Other people don't seem to see that, though. Commentors respond with vitriol, disgust, hatred, ""You need to get some serious help."" Which puts someone with OCD into a place where their ocd gets life threateningly worse-- because people just told them they are what they fear they are. EVEN THOUGH they are most likely the opposite.

Not to say that every time I see someone post about these violent or unspeakable thoughts I assume it's definitely ocd. Rather, I notice the following:

*They are afraid they will act on these thoughts

*They are trying to get reassurance that they won't act on these thoughts 

*They don't like these thoughts. These thoughts are distressing

*The way they describe their thoughts clearly describes intrusive thoughts just without the vocabulary

*They describe compulsions without knowing they are compulsions

*Their post *is* a compulsion (reassurance-seeking, checking, researching, confessing)

The list goes on.

I have OCD. I actually have hospitalized myself because I believed I was going to kill my parents, sister, or classmates. I believed I was going to kill my cat at the time. I've been afraid I was going to become a pedophile. I've been afraid I was going to become a cannibal. I've been afraid I was going to kill my partner and keep their body. I've been afraid my affinity for foods with red sauce meant I was thirsting for human blood and flesh.

Regardless of the theme of the intrusive thoughts, many intrusive thoughts are or feel unspeakable. Because people associate OCD with symmetry and hand washing, most people miss the fact that OCD can involve incredibly tabboo and violent intrusive thoughts. Furthermore; OCD feels real. It feels real. Meaning, you FEEL like you actually do want to kill people. You feel like you actually are attracted to your sister even though you arent. A lot of people with OCD don't think they have it because it feels so real that if they accept its ocd, they might lose their hypervigilance and act on the thoughts. Because if they stop their compulsions, they believe that they will act on the thoughts. 

The stigma around mental health isn't just about personal hygeine or being late to work. Sometimes, people are afraid they're gonna fuck their dog and when they talk about it, everyone freaks the fuck out and doesn't look for signs of OCD. 

Most people with OCD don't realize they have it. So, when they're overwhelmed with these incredibly horrifying thoughts, they might seek online support. They might make posts like ""I'm afraid I'm going to lose control of my homicidal urges."" ""Am I attracted to my sister?"" ""I'm worried I'm a pedophile""

But as someone with ocd, I read these posts and very clearly see the other ocd symptoms attached to these fears. What do other people see? They see rapists, murderers, pedophiles, paraphiliacs. Even though these posts tend to involve details like ""I've never hurt anyone."" ""I'm too scared to hurt anyone."" ""I've never touched anyone.""

Still, the comments treat them like filth. Like criminals. And that's part of the problem.

When I tried to reach out about my Harm ocd when I was 14, my counselor freaked out when I told her about my thoights and started screening me for ASPD. I know someone who was falsely diagnosed with ASPD when they actually had harm ocd and it fucked them up for years. People with OCD do not want to act on these thoughts. These thoughts go against their identity and core values. These thoughts scare them even if they feel so real, even if they feel like they are choosing to think them.

People with Harm ocd or sexual assault themed ocd are some of the least likely people to commit these acts. They are constantly engaging in compulsions to prevent it, and they DONT want these things to happen. (Ie I used to tie my ankle to my bed post at night so I wouldn't kill anyone. I used to not go to school so I wouldn't lunge out at anyone. I used to not pet my cat because I didn't want to kill him. I used to avoid hugging my sister because I thought it meant I was attracted to her... even though I'm gay and also ew???. I never baby sat my cousins because I was afraid I wanted to hurt them or abuse them.)

I encourage people to consider ocd. When you see these ""scary"" or ""disgusting"" posts, look out for characteristics of ocd. Anecdotal evidence but I guarantee, 9/10 times what these people are describing is undiagnosed ocd, obsessional thinking, and intrusive thoughts. They just don't have the vocabulary. Instead of saying ""I have intrusive thoughts about hurting someone I love."" They say ""I keep having homicidal urges. How can I stop them?""

Sometimes, people need compassion even if what they're saying is shocking and you couldn't imagine having the same fears or thoughts. Instead of mocking them or treating them like monsters, look for OCD. Often times when people with undiagnosed ocd reach out for help, they're not going to have the vocabulary to confirm to viewers/readers that what they're experiencing is intrusive thoughts and obsessional fear. They're going to describe something scary because it's something that scares them and its what they're experiencing. 

Ending mental health stigma doesn't stop at forgiving people for not showering. It's also looking deeper when someone says ""what if I choke my cat."" ""What if I molest someone.""

Because believe it or not, people can think things and not want them to happen. In fact sometimes people's thoughts can be their greatest fears. OCD is egodystonic, meaning it specifically latches on to your values and exposes you to the opposite. 

Before you call someone a psychopath, consider ocd.

1570490826.0,I no longer want to die.,"This time 2 months ago, I was 34 weeks pregnant, with an adoption plan in place to relinquish my baby at birth. After years of suffering heavily with my mental health, I thought I was too fucked up to be able to love a child. No maternal instincts, I couldn‚Äôt even look after myself, how the fuck would I look after a baby?

I thought it‚Äôd be cruel to subject a child to a lifetime with me. That my baby would be better with someone else, I concealed the pregnancy from my entire family, I‚Äôd completely isolated myself from everybody, convinced that I would give birth, give up my baby, and never tell a soul. 

The isolation, spending weeks on end alone in a flat without leaving the house led to a massive decline in my already dire mental health. At 8 months pregnant, an ambulance was called to me at a multi story car park at 3am. I couldn‚Äôt do it, not when there was only a few weeks to go, as much as I wanted to die, I figured I‚Äôd hang on just 4 more weeks until my baby was born, then I‚Äôd do it. 

This led to many services getting involved, social workers, specialist midwives, the crisis team, the home treatment team and even perinatal mental health specialists. I‚Äôm not going to go into detail about the home environment I was in, because it still pains me to this day, but it was heavily infested with rats, only one window to the whole place, but because I was heavily pregnant (suffering with carpal tunnel) and could no longer work (I‚Äôm self employed, no maternity leave/pay.) I was stuck there, In this dungeon, 8 months pregnant stuck in a dark hell hole I couldn‚Äôt go outside due to concealing my pregnancy, listening to rats chewing through the walls around me. I was so ready to die.

Then, my family tried to barge in, convinced that I had fallen into a horrible drug addiction or worse, was rotting away alone, I promised that I would see them the next day and tell them what was happening. They thought this was me being ready to open up, get help, when really it was me giving up. I had nothing left to lose, I planned on being dead soon anyway, and I missed them. During my pregnancy, because of me concealing it i had to miss seeing my mother in hospital after she was rushed in for emergency surgery, my family dog dying (I never got to say goodbye) and, the death of my aunty and her funeral. I figured if I was going to die soon, I wanted to spend my last bit of time with them. I was surrendering, the adoption plan was in place, my baby would have a good life.

My family were supportive, as I knew they would be. Many services presumed my reason for hiding the pregnancy from them was out of fear, but it was the opposite. I‚Äôm lucky to come from a loving wealthy family who I didn‚Äôt want to change my mind. I wanted to die. 

My family begged me not to go through with the adoption, my mother offering to take full custody of my baby if I tried motherhood and didn‚Äôt like it. I wanted them to be happy, I thought he could be my replacement when I was gone, that he‚Äôd keep them busy and take some weight off their grief of losing me. I agreed, my mother got me to move back in with her, and I enjoyed the luxuries of sleeping at night not worrying about rats crawling over me and having access to hot water again. 

12 days after I told my family I was pregnant, my beautiful baby boy was born, 3 weeks early. From the second I first held him, he was my boy, and he wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.

From the moment he was here, it‚Äôs like my mental illness has been an awful boot camp that I‚Äôve finally graduated. Like all my suffering is now worth something. 

As you‚Äôll know, BPD amplified all emotions, I feel everything so intensely my emotions are like a physical sensation. In the past, this has caused me so much pain and heartbreak, until the second I first held my son, and the feeling of maternal love flooded me with the most intense, incredible feeling i could ever imagine. Something I never imagined I could feel, that I thought I was too fucked up to experience, came to me so naturally. And now I have a little human who I can love as much as I want and it doesn‚Äôt aggravate him. I‚Äôm never ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô for him, because he needs me and depends on me fully. How can I possibly be suicidal anymore when I have my baby who will always need me?

All those nights I‚Äôve spent awake all hours in tears, seem like preparation for the sleepless nights of having a newborn (,minus the tears!) 

My baby has become my fixation, and the best part? He wants all of my love, he doesn‚Äôt want space from me. And I‚Äôm never alone anymore. I have somebody to be strong for. Do I still feel like shit sometimes? Absolutely. But I don‚Äôt get the chance to feel like shit for too long, cause my baby keeps me busy! My overthinking myself into depressive episodes? Don‚Äôt have the time anymore, my boy needs me.

I never imagined being a mother, and I never imagined getting better.. which I‚Äôm still not fully. But I‚Äôm the best I‚Äôve been in years, and for the first time in a truly long time, I‚Äôm no longer suicidal. I want to be here, I want to care for my son, make sure he‚Äôs so loved that he‚Äôll never feel unwanted like I have. And with him around, I can‚Äôt imagine feeling unwanted for a long time (until he‚Äôs old enough for me to be embarrassing!)

It‚Äôs like all the love that I‚Äôve had to give finally has a place to go. I‚Äôm so happy. I look at him and I just want to do right by him, to be the best mother I can be. 

2 months ago I was 8 months pregnant, isolated from everybody, in a dark rat infested flat, planning on ending my life.

Now, I‚Äôm currently led on my big comfy double bed, watching my 6 week old baby sleeping peacefully beside me in his Moses basket, in a nice light clean house, smiling to myself and making plans for our future. 

I always rolled my eyes when people told me it gets better. I‚Äôd suffered over a decade of things just getting worse, until this year, I‚Äôd finally hit rock bottom. 

Now I‚Äôm on top of the world. I‚Äôve never been happier than I have being a mother. It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve truly enjoyed being alive. 

This turned into a huge essay, but I don‚Äôt like sharing this too much IRL because of the shame and embarrassment of living in such poor conditions, the state my mental health had got to, and also now that he‚Äôs here... it breaks my heart to think I ever even considered adoption.

I‚Äôve been heavily and closely monitored by many services, and in the 6 weeks since his birth, I‚Äôve been discharged by 4, and have reduced visits from daily to fortnightly/monthly by all of them. They all tell me how amazing I‚Äôm doing at being a mother, and how in their professions it‚Äôs so nice to see a happy ending. I feel like I‚Äôm finally good enough at something, and that‚Äôs being his mummy.

Sorry to go on, I just wanted to share my story and hopefully inspire others that sometimes things do get better.

1559273517.0,Why is mental health care so inaccessible?,"Everyone's advice is always, ""talk to a professional"" but nobody will acknowledge how impossible that is. 

I work a full-time job, with benefits. Financially, I'm not rich, but I'm not poor. My insurance supposedly covers mental health services, but I recently made the call for a referral, and I was only given a list of 3 providers. None of them are accepting new patients, and even if they were, I can't find enough info on them online to even know if they will be a good fit for me.

There are a few providers in town that I think I would feel really comfortable with, but they are not covered under my insurance and I cannot afford to pay out of pocket. I make enough that I don't qualify for sliding scale, but not enough to actually pay the full rates.

This is ridiculous to me that, at this point in my life, I am more financially stable than I ever have been and quite frankly, pretty privileged in terms of money. Yet, I cannot get decent mental health care.

Honestly, it scares me and it makes me feel a bit hopeless. I've been going back and forth with even wanting help, and it took a lot for me to finally decide to make that phone call. I'm super disappointed that I am not finding anything that can help me.",mentalhealth
1693005482.0,I hate being a woman.,"I feel so worthless and inferior. I've always thought that I am quite smart, but I have a couple of male friends who often call me stupid and an idiot for even the smallest things (I have NEVER heard them call other men stupid etc.) I feel like I'm quite beautiful, but on the other hand, my face is so boring that I get tired of it myself. I have green eyes and some freckles and I could try to do everything to look different but my face is just too plain. I feel like I'm pretty funny but whenever I tell a joke, no man laughs but when a man tells the same joke, everyone reacts.

Two of my interests are music and sports but often men tell me that I have stupid, bad or wrong options about them or that I don‚Äôt understand those thing at all. I feel like the biggest reason why I've been feeling this sad and inferior for the past couple of years is because I'm a female. I would do anything to be born as a man. I feel like such a pick me after writing all that but I‚Äôve heard that other women feel the same as I do. Ofc not everyone but some. And I don't blame men for this problem of my self-esteem, but I would just like to feel that I am on the same level as them.

I make the traditional small talk, just trying to respond as positively as I could to his incessant negativity when out of nowhere I get ‚ÄúYou ch-nks never know when to shut the fuck up and it‚Äôs starting to piss me off‚Äù.

&#x200B;

I saw the recent documentary on incels by the BBC, and it was just me staring at what I've become.

&#x200B;

I'm socially maladjusted due to my upbringing, my parents didn't allow me to interact with other kids, so my social skills dwindled ever since. I have a lot of social anxiety, and can barely look people in the eyes. My posture is stiff, I can't smile, I'm paranoid that everyone hates me.

&#x200B;

Because of this, I tried to find a community of others that felt similar to me. I dwelled within incel forums for the past 2-3 years, but I don't want to live this way. I see people on there talking about the most fucked up shit, and I sometimes smiled about it. I don't want to be this way.

&#x200B;

I want help but I don't know what to do. How do I become socially successful and beat social anxiety? I want to be accepted by others, not become a sick person.

1604600180.0,I'm a 40+ year old man with two young boys and a wife. I need to brain dump.,"Firstly, I just need this out of my head. I am not posting for attention or answers. I just need to get this all out without effecting someone else with my worries or just downright dumb thoughts.

I've been messing up again. Not knowing what's going on with schools and if they will close them again or if they will just keep going until kids start dropping. I don't know if I'm really worried if I've been made to feel that way. I don't know because the people in power are less honest than my 6 year old.

He's six. He was just 1. My other is 4. But he was just born it feels like. I'm 41. AND MY KIDS ARE 6 AND 4. How much longer do I have where I will be mentally fit to care for them? Or will I just be the old ass cranky dad who forgot what it's like to feel the magic of being a child? I haven't yet but one day I will. Will I make a big enough impact in my sons lives then when I die they will miss me? Will they talk about me with pride? Or will it be all the ways I failed...I'm so scared to screw up being a father that it is crippling.

My father wasn't a father. He was there. He didn't beat me or hurt me or scream at me. For that he would have had to actually care I was alive. I haven't spoke to him in years and I don't see that ever changing. My mom. My mother. The most racist, horrible, mean, scorned and damaged person I have ever met. I love her but I don't ever want to see them again.

I'm white. My wife is black. We have two mixed boys. The world is so messed up. Will my boys be treated different? Will they be looked down on? Will they not get chances because of it? Or will someone hand them something just because they are mixed? Why in the hell do I worry about this? Will they get killed at school? Will I be able to save them if they are in danger?

How do I cook a fucking hamburger on the stove without it turning to shit? I can't even fix the damn toilet that keeps clogging because I was never shown how to be a man and I know the world is different and It might not be right but It feels that way. I have nothing to be proud of. What my kids and wife? How in the hell has she not left me yet? I'm the most annoying person you could meet. I started puking again. I can't handle this. I used to be skinny and fast and strong. Now my knees hurt. The other day I hurt my neck from STANDING UP? It hurt for three days. I feel like there is nothing useful in me anymore. I'm 41 and anything that mattered is gone. Now I only have jobs. I have a job to raise my children to be great humans who don't hate. I have to teach my wife how to prepare for when I die. I have to make sure everyone is okay and taken care of. So when I die they are okay.

So what about while I'm alive? I get that I don't matter in the long run. My children do. But I am sick of being here. On Earth. I'm scared. I'm mentally alone. I make myself feel this way and I don't know why. I just want a life I can't have. I try to make things like they were...like all the horrid holidays when I was a child I try to make so beyond special for my kids that I've spoiled them and now nothing means anything.

I just want to feel like I'm wanted again. Not needed. I wish I had a friend. But I'm terrified of people. I can't even order at a drive thru without going into a minor panic attack and ordering too much. I'm starting to mentally crack at the smallest things. I don't yell or scream. I go sit in the garage and cry. So no one knows it. So when someone askes me why I'm sad and I explain it, they can't follow up with ""well what you need to do is"" ""or you shouldn't feel"". No shit. I'm not doing it for attention and I didn't say it was rational but I'm a grown ass man and I should not feel like this. I should not feel like I only matter because of ""responsibilities"". I just want someone to have a better day just because I am in their life. Why is it so wrong to want to feel good about something? To be noticed. For something besides ""can I have a snack"". Or because 99% of every decision that has to be made has to be made by me or it doesn't get made. I'm stretched too thin. I'm not superman. I can't do it all. I can't always make a decision. I'm human. And right now, I'm scared. And I'm not dealing with it okay. I knew that when I started to puke after I eat. There is this spot in the back and side of my mouth that if I tap with a straw I can empty my stomach in 10 seconds. So now I eat once a day. And I notice that my belly stays now. My whole life I could never gain a pound. 140 was the most I ever got. Then I was 160. And my stomach was gone. Now it was bigger. I was short of breath. My hair is gray in spots. I'm getting older. I'm already old. And one day I'll die. And idk what that is either. But I know that it doesn't matter what good I do, what will matter the most is what I wasn't able to do. The areas where I failed. Because no one is perfect. So I am going to fail. And that is the one thing I cannot afford to do.

I'm not asking for a pity party. I'm not asking for a damn thing. I just needed this out. But I will say that being a man makes this harder. Men are treated different when they talk about mental health. If I could just man up I would. And I do. Every damn day I man up. I do my job. I take care of my family and I'm damn good at it. But sometimes, it all comes in at me. Sometimes I get a chance to sit and think. And that is scary. I live my life on autopilot. When I stop to think is when it's bad.

I don't know any of you but I hope you are all happy. We live in an age where it's almost comical for people say they just want to be happy. But it's not. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be loved. Or wanted to be noticed.

&#x200B;

1685151418.0,I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,"Hi everyone, 

About a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country, two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back, tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. 

I think this is interesting for a few reasons. 

1- As I said, I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees, bad back, apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. 

2- Mentally, I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression, bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. 

3- I was raised as a ward of the court, 30+ foster homes, street kid, jail, addiction. Been a hard road. 



So why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province, they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. 


Secondly, if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants, so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now, but I will end up being the same man. 

However, the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island, that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health, he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. 

So I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. 


It's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments, but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs, there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager, I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. 

I have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. 

I have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. 

Both the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. 


I hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives, don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :)

My parents had been married since 1979 when mom was 18 and dad was 22.
They have 4 sons ages 41, 40, 39, and 37 and then they have me a 17 yr old daughter. 

Today a neighbor stopped by to drop cookies off to my Dad and asked him out on a dinner date. Dad looked right at me and then told her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna have to get back to you on that one‚Äù 

Backstory on the neighbor: about a month after her husband died (like in 2016ish) she asked my Dad to come home with her one night from a bar party a bunch of the neighbors were at. Since then my Mom wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the neighbor since she tried to convince my Dad to go home with her, and my Dad has avoided this woman like the plague because he wasn‚Äôt interested in anyone but my Mom and didn‚Äôt want to be asked again. I‚Äôve personally witnessed my Dad jog from his truck to the house so he wouldn‚Äôt run into the neighbor and have to talk to her.

My parents were that couple that were still so obviously in love after so many years that anyone around them could see how they felt about one another. 

I obviously want my Dad to be happy and I would never stop him from seeing someone, but am I wrong to not feel quite ready yet to see my Dad with another women 3 months after my Mom passed?

Is it possible he was subtly telling her no without making a scene/awkward?

I have very low self-esteem and frequently deal with thoughts of not being good enough and feeling like people wouldn't miss me if I wasn't here. When people give me reasons to believe those thoughts, it fucks me up.

When my mom didn't call me on my birthday, I spent the whole day depressed because I thought she didn't care enough to remember.

When my family dog had to be put down suddenly, I was the last one to be told, and had it not been for my brother convincing my dad to call me, I wouldn't have known until the next morning, when she would've already been dead for hours. 

My dad got a new dog yesterday, which I again wasn't told until everyone else had known for a while. He didn't even tell me, my brother accidentally let it slip after they'd been to see it and was asked if they wanted to take her home with them for a few hours as a trial run. 

To anyone else, these would be things easily shrugged off, but they really get to me. Family is supposed to be the people who will want to be around you no matter what, yet I feel they try to avoid me and it sucks. On top of that, when I get emotional over these things, I get told I need to get my shit together and stop being to overdramatic. 

I talked to my brother about the dog-incident, and he told me to stop being so dramatic, and that this wasn't a big deal. To him it wasn't, to me it is. This argument has me in fucking tears cause I'm a mess.

My whole life I've been told my feelings are too much. I was the quiet, shy kid, and was never the one to get attention. However, when I was bullied at school and at home, and developed anxiety, I tried my best to get attention the only way I knew how, pretending to be sick. After the teachers caught on that I was faking, they eventually stopped caring, and let me walk around the school yard crying. It took me so long to realize I was crying because I was extremely anxious and was begging for help. 

Now, having been told my entire life that I'm just overreacting, that's also how I speak to myself. I'll have a literal panic attack, and the only thought in my head is that I'm faking. I still don't actually believe my panic attacks are real, even though the symptoms match up perfectly, but my brain will never give me the benefit of the doubt.

1609597833.0,Being addicted to daydreaming (Maladaptive daydreaming),"hey um.. I recently found out about this ""disorder"" (i put it in quotes because it is not actually recognized by the DSM)

It is when people daydream very extensively for sometimes hours a day. They create their own highly structured universes and scenarios that help them cope with drama etc.

They often have the urge to that as soon as they wake up. Also while doing that a lot of people engage on repetitive movement (like pacing around). I have heard that psychologists suspect that it activates certain areas in the brain that control your imagination or might effect it in a hypnotic way (((excuse my wording i am not a native speaker lol)))

Those people do NOT gaslight themself. In fact most of MDers are able to tell which of their memories are within their paracosm/imagination and which are not.

Effects of this intense daydreaming is that people with that ""disorder"" sometimes find it very hard to focus on ANYTHING.

Some people argue that daydreaming is natural and MD should not be regarded as a mental illness. I think it certainly has characteristics of a mental illness. It is a coping mechanism at the beginning but at some point MDers find themself daydreaming all day because they got so used to living in this paracosm that they don¬¥t enjoy reality as much anymore. And this is an endless circle. Because if you don¬¥t do stuff with other people or your friends, and avoid your responsibilities and flee in your paracosm your live will get more miserable and your imagined friends, scenarios and word will look more and more appealing.

I recently found out that i might have this ""disorder"". I have stumbled across this because I had problems with not being able to live in the present. A lot of my scenarios are about my future and they are often highly fantastical. So instead of actually doing stuff that might bring me to a future that i might enjoy i just dream about already being there.

Since then i am always searching for new information on this subject and one researcher that does amazing work within this field is Eli Somer. He was the first one who recognized it and publishes a lot of videos about MD on youtube.

Here is his channel: [https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic](https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic)

If you have any thoughts, or further research sources please drop them here. And especially if you have experience with this subject first hand.

You literally had not a single ounce of control over their stupidity, selfishness and incapability.

If you were abused, hurt, ripped apart by their words or even physically injured by those so-called grown-ups in your childhood, **it is absolutely and categorically not your fault**. And it is not your job to fix it. It's not your job now and it wasn't your job then. You had no control over their actions and no responsibility for them. They had the responsibility to care for you and they messed it up big time. You did not ask to be born into the situation you were born into. You were a vulnerable child whose needs, for some reason or another, were not fully met. And that rests entirely with the adults, not with you. A child can never be blamed for that. And the child who turns into the adult should not blame themselves for their parents' shortcomings, either.

Also, **you owe them nothing**. They may have fed you and put a roof over your head, but if they otherwise treated you like shit, or still do treat you like shit, walk away and don't look back. Now you're an adult and you have choices and autonomy over your own life. You don't need to be around them if you don't want to, or if it doesn't feel safe and secure.

I am so sorry that this happened to you and, believe me, I understand. Parents are not all as brilliant and kind as they're supposed to be. Some of them are assholes. Just want you to know you're not alone and you can live a happy life as an adult, without them.",mentalhealth
1694159407.0,My parents were having sex next to me and it fucked me up,"Hi guys. Just wanted to vent a bit about some of my childhood traumatic experieces.
When I was a child my parents had been having sex next to me in the same bed. My first memories are from around when I was 5 years old. They were doing it thinking I was asleep but I was too scared to tell them I am not and that I see and understand everything. I started then to make some noises during their sex so they could feel uncomfortable and they stopped doing it since I was about 7 because they moved me into my own room.
The thing is that it made me sexual way too young. I had my first sex with my female best friend when I was 8. I literally was repeating what I saw and I actually even experienced pleasure. She didn't even probably knew what I was doing. When her mother found out she was mad af. I remember my friend came to me and said we are not allowed to spend time together in her room anymore. After a while I started touching myself and putting some toys inside to feel pleasure. I was just 8 years old...
I feel so fucked up in my brain from all of this. I feel horrible for what I did. I feel gross about myself, I feel as a pervert and rapist. I hate myself for being so sexual. I had a very messy sexual life afterwards with a lot of partners and I was even cheating because sex was my weakness. I am ashamed of myself. I stopped having sex now because I feel like a perv. I don't know how to overcome this trauma and what can help. Did anyone else go through something similar? Please shine some light on this if you did. Thank you.

Update: Thank you all for such a support. I feel much better after reading your comments about the fact I was just a child and is not my fault I wasn't taught about sex and what's right and what's not. I also want to mention that I am a female and already an adult, it was more than 20 years ago but I kept this within myself for a long time because of shame and guilt I felt.

Despite my efforts I‚Äôm failing multiple classes at the fault of my teachers unable to cope with online learning resources. My parents believe I‚Äôm just slacking off when really I am working until the early hours of the morning everyday.

All of the pressure from school and my parents are blinding me from recognizing that I‚Äôm trying my absolute best and that the things that bother me the most right now are not my fault.

After all, I beat my depression, I‚Äôve made new friends, I got my license recently, and summer is right around the corner even if I have to do summer school at the rate things are going.

Ultimately, I just want to hear from somebody that they‚Äôre proud of me. I don‚Äôt get to hear it from the people I wish would say it, but I know people know my struggle right now and have struggled far more than me and it means a lot to hear it from people that understand.

What‚Äôs even worse is that my parents never taught me to apologize. I don‚Äôt know how and I feel incredibly awkward doing so.

I loved that girl more with all my heart. We‚Äôd been together since high school and all throughout college. She was diagnosed with cancer a few months after we graduated and died approximately six months later. It was obviously very painful for everybody involved, but she and I made our peace. 

After that, I completely focused myself in my career, and I‚Äôve seen a lot of success in it. I‚Äôm in a very good place right now professionally.

He answered ""Mmmm...mayyyyyyybe!""

OMG I am so happy that he feels confident and trusts me enough to tell me that! I told him I don't care who he loves, as long as he is happy. :) Our eldest daughter (the one graduating from college in a few weeks) is in a lesbian relationship, and I remember when she had come out to me at age 17. I said the same thing to her, and we have always been welcoming of anyone she dates.

&#x200B;

I am so proud of our daughter and son. :) Now for the 17 year old...I think he is still aromantic. He doesn't seem to be interested in anyone dating-wise. All 3 of our boys are on the Spectrum and have depression and anxiety, so I have never pushed them to ""find someone"". :) Our eldest has always been more academic than boy-crazy (or girl-crazy in her case), and I just want them to be happy--WHATEVER they end up doing...dating or not dating. :)

1542385039.0,My whole world just collapsed.,"My fianc√© walked out on me last night out of nowhere. We‚Äôve always had an amazing, strong relationship, or so I thought. I was putting dinner on his plate, a normal evening, until he mentioned he didn‚Äôt want much because his stomachs been upset and he can‚Äôt eat. When I asked why... that‚Äôs when my world ended. We have been together for 11 years, engaged for only 4 months. For the last 5 years, I‚Äôve been living with terminal cancer and he‚Äôs been my rock. My mental health has been very touchy as one can imagine having incurable cancer and he‚Äôs been the one thing keeping me here and fighting. I actually did a clinical trial that surprisingly helped me. We‚Äôre just getting to a place with my health where maybe I can live a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. We‚Äôre supposed to be leaving on vacation in a few weeks and finally got to a point where we can plan things for the future. Theres so much coming up. I‚Äôve been improving myself and my mental health A LOT. He says he sees these improvements and they should make him happy, but it doesn‚Äôt. He told me when I just had my scans, he should‚Äôve felt something, but he didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs lost his compassion for me and isn‚Äôt in love with me anymore. I supported him through school and now that he‚Äôs done, he‚Äôs not only my emotional, but my financial rock, as well as helping me with things my disability makes hard. I don‚Äôt have much family and I lost a lot of people when I was diagnosed with cancer. He threw in my face that he wants children and I can‚Äôt provide that (this isn‚Äôt anything new) and when I said I was getting to a point in my health where I could start looking into options for how to have kids he said, ‚Äúeven if we could, is it smart to bring a child into this world not knowing if they‚Äôll have a mom around?‚Äù Not being able to have kids has been one of the hardest things that i struggle with, and he knows that and always reassured me that I was more important. I didn‚Äôt even know this person talking to me. So cold, empty. I feel so hurt because many times at the beginning of my diagnosis, I told him to leave me so that I didn‚Äôt have to drag him into this life and he always promised me he wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. He told me he‚Äôs not happy with his life and his priorities have changed and he doesn‚Äôt want to resent me. We never even argued.

My son has ADHD (and possibly autism, we are in the process of getting an evaluation) so he has been getting a lot of attention and she explained how she felt like she was set aside. It was a great conversation because I had no idea she had felt that way because it always seemed like she wasn‚Äôt interested in spending time with me and she would decline most of the time. We are planning on doing some fitness activity together but we are still figuring out what, she wanted to weight lift but our local gyms don‚Äôt allow children under 15.

To start with some background, I suffer from anxiety and depression, and I‚Äôm in recovery for anorexia (have been for 1 1/2 years). This semester is one of my hardest ones, as I‚Äôm taking 16 credit hours in 8 weeks, and it‚Äôs made me incredibly anxious, and has made my eating disorder come back into play. I feel like I‚Äôm dying because of the weight loss and my heart pounding at all times of the day. 

My cousin got into an extremely bad car accident two weeks ago, and she‚Äôs in a coma, had broken her neck and jaw, and the doctors are extremely pessimistic about her recovering.

It's essentially telling me my suffering and pain I feel every second of every day is less important than the emotions of the people around me, and that wanting it all to finally end is ""selfish"". 

It reduces my existence to nothing more than a NPC character on the lives of others, I only exist for their benefit, and everything I feel is necessary to continue experiencing for their benefit.

1645219153.0,"The first time I went to therapy was because my mom wanted to know what was wrong with me, once she knew that something was up she never took me back.","It was in middle school and I don‚Äôt remember much of it, but I remember that I didn‚Äôt know how to socialize or approach to people.

One day I was crying and having a mental breakdown and my mom got so mad at me because I would not stop yelling and sobbing.

A sudden point she said that we needed to go to the doctor and I was asking her why.
She told me these exact words ‚Äúwe are going to a doctor to see what the **** is wrong with you‚Äù.


Total confusion, didn‚Äôt know what she meant, we got into the car and we went to a weird place that I don‚Äôt remember what it was exactly, I know for sure that there was people that where waiting in the hallway and some of them where injured.

They called out my mom‚Äôs name and we went into an office, they where sitting two woman, they started to ask me questions, like how I was doing and what I liked to do in the free time etc.

I didn‚Äôt talk because of anxiety, literally not a word.

A sudden point they asked if they could talk to me alone without my mom, she said yes.

A sudden point I just started crying after she left the room, I was telling them that I didn‚Äôt want to live anymore And that everything was so stressful for me, specially at school because everyone was making fun on me.

They continued asking me questions and told them that I was not happy and didn‚Äôt want to do anything because I felt like it would serve me no purpose.

I talked to them for an hour, after that they let my mother in, they told her that I needed to come back because clearly something was wrong and they needed to starting sessions with me to help me out.

Once we got home my mom really got angry at me, she literally told me that all that was a waste of time and that of course something was wrong with me but she didn‚Äôt want to spend another penny on me for my problems.

1627628598.0,"I did it. I left the house and it almost went terribly, but I did it.","So nobody knows who I am but a few weeks ago I put up [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/oh37fp/how_to_get_out_of_the_house_without_it_seeming/) on this sub asking how to discretely go outside and what I should do (keep in mind I'm about as shut in as a shut-in gets.)

I only got 1 reply on the post, which btw, thank you u/Azarqo I meant to reply to your post but I ended up taking 3 whole weeks to push myself to find the post again. Anyway, I tried their suggestion and it worked... 50/50. By that I mean 1 part went really sour and the other actually was pretty good. Overall success, if you round up.

What happened exactly, if you read my last post I wanted to leave the house without causing my parents to worry about my mental state or wellbeing. That didn't go very well, at ALL. The moment I said ""Well you guys always say I should leave the room and go somewhere so I am now."" they immediately invited me to a talk in the living room about if I'm going out to meet someone or if there's something they should know or if I'm alright. Nope. nah. I'm good. Just... leaving... to wal-mart... yeah cuz everywhere else is closed now... no I'm alright...

I ended up inviting my brother cuz he also sits in bed all day and my Dad suggested it and me and my brother are really chill with each other. Eventually they're like ""Ok, I mean we're not stopping you, so... if there's anything you need to tell us, yknow-"" and me and my brother are out. Finally. It felt like rolling a 2 on a d20 but still succeeding (which I guess implies this was hard to screw up, but oh well)

Now the good part, we DID end up going to walmart. You may be wondering why in ALL of the places walmart? Well, I don't know a lot of places that aren't stores or places where you can walk in without some expectation of you spending money there (I mean, why else do people build buildings, eh?) My original plan was to go to the library but fun fact about the library: It just so happens on Thursdays and only Thursdays they close at 6PM instead of 9PM. And I was leaving the house later than I had initially planned to, since I spent so much time preparing and working up the nerve to tell my parents. Also we live in the middle of frick-off nowhere, and Walmart and the library are like 10-15 minute drives away from my home. There weren't many options, I tell you. (btw I found out I live there because my parents didn't want neighbors and liked the peace and quiet, which explains why we live at the end of a dead-end street and why I grew up very sheltered and very asocial.)

Walmart was fun. Especially since my brother is really into old stuff that we used to always be hyped about like nerf guns and lego. I told him I don't have anything to pay off so let's buy useless stuff, and we did. Checkout line was long as usual. No one was wearing a mask, as usual. I then remembered that Dunkin' Donuts closes at 9PM and it was almost 8, so I asked him if he wanted a donut since we have time. This is a weird bit that's unimportant to the story, but I want to bring it up anyway. We get there (literally across the street from Walmart) and we reach the doors. The employees see us, and just... leave. One dude literally tried to stand behind the computer so we wouldn't see him, even after rattling the door that has the hours printed on them. Ok... you guys just... not want anyone in here..? We end up leaving, donut-less and heartbroken... but oh well, at least I had made the effort to drive out, which I guess was the whole point.

The cool thing after that is that my parents seemed fairly cool about the situation afterword when I got home. I guess they had time to think it over while we were out as opposed to me appearing suddenly in proper clothes all like ""ah yes I've decided to go *outside* today!"" They treated me as if I had just came back from work, or turning in some checks at the bank. Just ""so what'd you guys do? Oh, cool cool"" you get the idea. My mom also looked up reviews on that dunkin' and apparently it has a reputation for bad service and willful ignorance, so ok I guess.

So, that was sure an experience that felt awkward and painful at the start, but *hopefully* I can just force it into becoming a normal thing. I plan on going to the Library next, probably by myself this time. Just to do some sketching and checking out some drawing guides and good reads. Then, they'll have no choice but to let me go back when I have to return the books. I'm telling you guys, it's the perfect plan. I'm only concerned with how my parents think about me now. They really, truly sounded concerned about me earlier, but bro I'm just trying to *do things* that normal people do everyday.

So yeah. Success.",mentalhealth

He also likes to dismiss all my morals and has told me multiple times to stop caring about stuff and if I try and explain why I care he changes the subject to mindfulness. Also he only ever talks about shit from that Netflix series called headspace its like he watched the first episode and all he knows about anything.

I can't even get a new therapist as I can't get another due to multiple reasons so I'm either stuck with a dick who makes me feel crap, or I give up with therapy and then get kicked out, as I'm only allowed to live at home aslong as I'm talking to a therapist that also kinda sucks.",mentalhealth

1582075366.0,We are failing our children,"The mental health system for children in America is fucked. My daughter (11) needs more than once a week therapy but isn‚Äôt suicidal or violent and there‚Äôs essentially zero immediate help for her despite her school and I both understanding she needs more immediate care. I live in one of the best cities for healthcare (Boston), have good insurance and still - we have called over 20 child therapists that aren‚Äôt accepting new patients and have had Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital recommend a partial hospitalization program and guess what? There‚Äôs only ONE lone PHP program within a 40 mile radius of where I live that offers a program for children under 13 and it‚Äôs overflowing with no availability.

1545258516.0,Made my first therapist appointment!,"This is a HUGE deal for me. I'm 26 and during my entire life, my parents have yelled and screamed that mental health, more specifically anxiety and depression, wasn't a real thing. They often dismiss anything that they don't want to accept, anything that might be a real issue. I wasn't allowed to go to a therapist, even when the school counselor brought me in almost weekly (mostly in middle school) to talk about well, anything. They were just trying to get something out of me but I often thought I was in trouble and didn't really understand why I kept getting taken out of class. 

So I've been struggling with my demons my entire life, looking for ways to cope, most of the time it was through drugs/alcohol, but I've cut down on that a lot. A close friend of mine has repeatedly told me over and over that I need to go talk to a therapist, and he's tried to convince me that I'm not crazy because I need help. Over and over and over again I told him that I didn't need to, I was fine, I just need to vent sometimes. I guess though, after my last episode a couple days ago, I was going on and on about how I just wasted my whole life, how I keep wasting time, how I don't have a direction, how I'm afraid to leave, how I'm afraid to act on things, how I'm indecisive, etcetcetc and he just flat out told me again that I really really need to seek someone out and it's not because he didn't want to help, he just doesn't know how to get to the root of my problem.

After some extensive research, I found a really nice counseling office right by my house. The counselor has a therapy dog too! My first appointment is on January 2, right after I get out of work. I'm stoked, but I'm also really intimidated and fearful that maybe I'm expecting too much out of this. Here's to hoping for the best and a bright future.",mentalhealth
