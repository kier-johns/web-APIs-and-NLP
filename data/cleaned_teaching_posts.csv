I'm new to the city I'm studying in so I don't have any connections to schools/teachers here. I was wondering if it's okay to email a high school and/or teacher's email as posted on the school site. Here's what I was thinking of including: * Basic intro of my name, the First Nation I'm from (my teacher program is only for Indigenous people), and my educational background (where I study rn, the 5 day observation aka not a practicum, & a mention of my experience in alternative education as a teenager)* How I found their email so they're not weirded out* Request to talk about their experience as a teacher (I like getting to know someone's philosophical ideas towards education) as I'm interested in observing their class for 5 days * If the teacher happens to also be a librarian or I'm emailing an alternative school directly, I think I should offer a resume since I work at two libraries (both specialize in different topics relevant to teaching)For reference I'm becoming a high school (grades 8-12) history and social studies teacher in Vancouver!

I appreciate them so much and it feels like no one else does! We are not a behavioural school and results will suffer but so will kids who aren't acting up and it's ridiculously unfair.I know they're struggling and are unhappy but if they leave will other schools be the same?For example at what point do you exclude or suspend a child, staff are hurt regularly and threatened VIRs are filled out and posted on CPOMs and yet still come in the next day like nothing has  happened with no consequences.

Even tho that’s years away. I’m trying to remain hopeful.This is gonna be a long one. I’m 18 and 8 weeks into my first semester of community college I dropped out. I’m sort of at a loss since I’ve known I’ve wanted to be a teacher since I was 9. I got really serious about it when I was 13, and after a traumatic senior year. I was lucky to even have graduated. So I apply to community college. I get in since they take everyone. Major in education with the goal of getting an associates degree in teaching then transferring to a 4 year to get my bachelors in history. Work as a teacher for 10-20 years. Then go back to school to get my masters in school administration and become a principal for another 10-20 years before I retire.I’ve spent my whole adolescence carefully thinking about this career path. Lurking this sub since I was 14, constantly talking to teachers at my school about their experiences and thoughts on the matter. Even going into the teaching assistant program my junior year in which I helped out at my districts elementary schools.Frankly most teachers have tried to urge me to stay away from this profession. And it hurts. To see adults I look up to. To have them actively discourage me from what is basically my dream. It hurts. But I understand their reasons.But the community college I’m at frankly sucks. There’s a reason my older sister hated it. There’s a reason my older brother avoided it. There’s a reason most kids I graduated with also avoided it. Because even for community colleges it sucks. The professors are subpar and Faculty isn’t helpful at all. I kept telling myself I would just finish this semester and see how it goes but I can’t anymore. So I dropped out.Before everything went to crap my senior year. I had a 3.4 gpa and was 83 of my 246 student class. But by graduation I had a 2.9 and was 152 of my class. My mom gave me an ultimatum near the end of the school year. Either she’d buy me a car. But I’d have to go to community college and stay here at home. Or she’d pay my tuition for a 4 year university. But she would not buy me a car. Deciding I wanted the car I decided to go to community college. But once I started class my mom admitted to me that she had no intentions of buying me a car. And that she just wanted me to stay at home. Upset I continue to go to but eventually I no longer could. I’ve grown distaste for that school and I know I deserve better. I by no means deserve to go to some big fancy Ivy League school. But I just know I deserve better than that sad excuse of a community college. It’s just such a disconnect. My mom owns a successful business and employs multiple people.She pays for my older brothers tuition and he went to a 4 year as soon as he graduated high school. Now she’s starting to pay my sisters tuition since she made a big deal about paying for her tuition for the last 2 years. And we are Latino. She’s told me my whole childhood and upbringing how everything she does. It’s to ensure we have a better life than the one she had growing up in her home country. So her not really financially supporting me does hurt. But that’s her choice and I can’t get mad what she chooses to do with her money. Regardless she’s made it clear to me that she has no intention of financially supporting me. So if I want to go to college and become a teacher. It’s on me to save up money myself to do it myself. Because it’s clear my mom  isn’t going to help me achieve my dream. So for now. My goal is to save up to buy my own car. Then save up to go to a 4 year. Even doing some basic Math tho. From dropping out to attending classes again at a 4 year. This is easily going to take me 4-5 years to do. I’m already working at a restaurant and currently trying to secure more shifts for myself.  I just know I’m coming back. Even if it takes more than 4 to 5 years. I know I want to continue my education. As a child of an immigrant I have seen and understood just how important and valuable education is. And I know I want to be apart of that.While I might keep lurking this sub. I don’t think I’ll look at it as much as I used to. Because for now I just need to focus on goals in life.

I run into the trouble maker best friend and we're chatting and he tells me the polite kid has now become close friends with a bad influence who he implied was getting them both involved in bad things.Troublemaker was smart enough to duck out, but polite kid is apparently well on the way to get hooked.This was all implied, never stated outright, and all happens outside of school grounds, never a hint of whatever activities they're up to enters school. So I have nothing to report.But I wonder if I should talk to polite kid's parents and drop a hint about the friends their son is making?

My classroom layout has some issues. It's a pretty small room and about twice as wide as it is long. The chalkboard resides on one of the short walls, and I have a ""smart board"" (oversized computer monitor) on wheels. Currently, I have the smart board on one of the long walls, and I use both the smart board and the chalkboard for most of my lessons. Desks are in groups of 3-4, and students turn to face whichever wall has the board that's currently in use.Here are the problems:1) There are some visibility issues with having the smart board on the long wall. Students who are situated close to the board but off to the sides have a hard time seeing the display.2) The school has a big fighting problem (physical and verbal) as well as some bullying issues. Many of my students genuinely hate each other. It is very difficult to put together teams of 3-4 students in which no one will fight. Also, some students have been using the connecting desks as channels by which to covertly pass gossipy notes, which I am trying to put a stop to.3) I have some minor hearing problems that make it difficult to pinpoint where sounds are coming from. When students are sitting super close together, it's not always possible for me to discern who is saying what, which makes informal assessment difficult and also makes it hard to intervene when a student is saying mean things or trying to provoke a peer. I was thinking that moving the smart board to be on the same wall as the chalkboard and having desks situated individually in staggered rows facing that wall would solve these problems.

Black, khaki, or grey slacks, nicer quality blouses and cardigans, and I’m pretty conservative when it comes to dresses and skirts. I have some black Skechers dress loafers and an array of sandals and flats. It’s just what I’m comfortable in.

I'll put together multiple choice questions that, even if you don't know the answer, you can reason through it pretty readily, and they select the answer that is 100% obviously not correct.

I used my Ph.D. advisor’s course lecture notes and assignments, as he was teaching the other section. Throughout the semester I could tell I was making mistakes. I didn’t know how to answer more specific questions or explain certain topics very well. I made excuses for mistakes in the notes and often came to class extremely tired and not thinking very clearly (I have a diagnosed sleep disorder and have finally gotten medication for it). I had some days where I felt everything went well, and others that were a complete flop. My course evaluations 100% reflected this. Several students mentioned how they liked me, but the majority made comments about how obvious it was that I was a first time instructor, that I struggled explaining some of the material, etc.The problem is, is that I loved teaching. I know where I went wrong, and if I taught again (not just this class, but any class), I really feel like I could do so much better. I’ve grown so much more confident in my abilities, and feel like I could truly fix the mistakes I had made previously. When I taught, I was scared and easily flustered so I basically said anything that would come to mind with minimal filter, so i did make a lot of excuses that I should not have or would forget how I prepared to explain something. My advisor keeps telling me it’s mostly a confidence issue as well as an experience issue, and that I should take the reviews as an attack, but rather a learning experience.Now I’m applying for jobs in academia, and looked at my students evals while writing a teaching statement. The evals have really made me question everything. I don’t doubt that I’d love to be an instructor, and that I’ve learned from my last experience - but how can I possibly talk about my effective classroom strategies when I essentially failed last semester?

One student (A) was talking about something that I thought seemed connected to what another student (B) had said earlier. They were sitting on opposite sides of the room, so I could only see Student B out of the corner of my eye as I was listening to Student A, but I though I saw them perk up and start to raise a hand in response to the same connection I saw to their earlier comment. I was eager to bring them into the discussion, as they tend to be quieter, so was anticipating turning to them when student B was finished. By the time student B had wrapped up, though, Student A seemed to have withdrawn again, and Student C had their hand eagerly raised. In a moment of frazzledness, the wires of anticipating asking student A if there was something they wanted to say crossed with those of calling on the student with their hand raised, and I called Student C by Student A's name. Vaguely mortified, I immediately corrected myself, and, after Student C had finished, turned back to try to see if Student A had in fact wanted to say something earlier; she said she did not.Only at that point did I fully realize that my error might have had an effect beyond just seeming like I was rather scattered: both Student C and Student A are young women of the same race, such that I imagine they very well might have felt like, by calling one the name of the other, I had mixed them up in the sense of not being able (or caring enough) to tell them apart. The moment had already passed for an immediate apology--beyond my initial quick correction--and, though I was now infinitely more mortified, it felt like apologizing after the fact would just make things worse by calling more attention to it.

In my past labs and student teaching, I built great relationships with students. Six weeks into this school year, and I feel no connection whatsoever to my students. I also just feel completely lost when it comes to lesson planning and paperwork. I am a completely inadequate teacher and I know these kids deserve better than that.

I feel like I didn’t get much out of it or grow professionally from the experience because outside of spear-heading a few lessons, I didn’t do all that much. I was hesitant to force myself into her processes because at a fundamental level, it wasn’t my class and I didn’t feel comfortable compromising the students learning with my amateur understanding and ability. I imagine this is not a wholly unique experience, but none of my education thus far has supplemented any of it or filled in any gaps. I don’t know what an IEP is, what the grading structure is supposed to be, how to grade an essay, how many lesson plans I should have day 1, how many of them should be topically contiguous, how to even delineate what reading and writing level a particular student is currently at, etc…None of my education up to this point has talked about literally any of this.

I have been punched in the face, kids have tried to stab my hand with a pencil and scissors, and most of these were within the first week or two. The rest of the time, I am berated and for lack of a better phrase, my mental health has declined rapidly. I will admit that I lose my temper with these kids, I am 22 and my mother was a SPED paraeducator while I was growing up, and I was a substitute teacher, and long term substitute paraeducator since I was 19 - and the way these kids treat their teachers and peers makes me sick, so of course I will raise my voice a bit when they’re not listening. It is what I was taught working in the system my whole working life. The salt in the wound was when the principal looked at me and told me she “had such high hopes for me with my background in substituting and working in [their after school program] for 6 years.” Said program I only stopped working in because it was shut down with covid. She then ended it all by saying “we had expectations, and I’ve only dissapointed her.” And then proceeding to say something about the 3 month probation, which I don’t remember much about - I kind of shut down.Like I said, I am now on probation because of this. I was told my tone was embarrassing children when they don’t listen, and my language is unacceptable.

I now see that this was wrong, but I do not regret it. He fixed his behavior.) These kids are horrible and the lack of discipline really does get to them. They run around yelling racial slurs at the mandarin teacher, and eachother, get into fights, and throw food at eachother and yell across the cafeteria during lunch.

I have been employed as a full time teacher at the middle/highschool level for 10 years. This summer my husband and I decided to make a significant move back to our hometown. Initially, I planned to use this move as a way to transition out of teaching all together but of course was reached out to by a local elementary school in need of a .5 FTE librarian, and decided to take it due to the schedule (3 day on 3 days off). It is over a 50% pay decrease from my previous position and offers no benefits, but I have a two year old at home (our only), that I am desperate to spend more time with and decided that the poor pay and lack of benefits would be worth it to have three days off to spend more time with her. Flash-forward to the school year and I immediately regret the decision. The first red flag came when my mentor suggested I send my daughter to daycare an extra day so I could come in (UNPAID) an extra day of the week due to the workload expectations. I am a hardworking employee, but the reason I took this job is to have a better work life balance. I also need to take 6 additional university credits by the end of the year that are paid for out of my own pocket to be employed as a librarian rather than a teacher which is a significant time commitment outside of the prep hours needed to teach 7 different grade levels back to back every day.

It turns out that curriculum is nothing more than a vague list of standards, so lesson planning has been all on me.I can mostly deal with all of that but  here is where I need advice: the past two weeks I have been invited to multiple “required” meetings after school from 4-6 on days that I am not scheduled to work. The expectation is basically that I will drive in to attend these meetings on my days off even though the meetings are not directly related to my content or job. I’m beyond frustrated about this. I was led to believe my schedule was 3 days on, 3 days off. These meetings are cutting into the flexibility I was under the impression I would have. ( for example, I want to do a zoo trip with my daughter tomorrow, but am told I must attend this meeting after school). I’m paid under 30,000 a year with no benefits.

I didn't major in education but I do have a degree and I got an ESL certificate (which was basically handed to all of us). All of the training I got in the ESL cert classes was also basically rendered useless once I was told what the job expectations were.They told me to teach listening and speaking. I'm not supposed to teach grammar, reading, or writing since that's what the Thai teachers do. I can correct their grammar as I notice mistakes, but it's supposed to be through speaking. I also wasn't given a curriculum, materials, or a teaching assistant and this is my first ever teaching job. I've tried quite a few things but it's basically one failed lesson after the next. Very few of them ever engage, the ones that do are already basically fluent in English, and none of them are really learning anything.I was told by another teacher, who's been here for 15+ years, that our job is more about playing games and building the students' desire to learn English. But I have no idea how to do that. All of the lessons I got in the ESL cert classes were for teaching grammar through modeling and drilling and then giving them a worksheet.When I tried teaching these grammar lessons, the students already knew all of the words and grammar I had to teach. But when I tried doing other things, they were all completely lost or uninterested. Things I've tried so far: Have them make a presentation on themselves and speak it in front of the class, act out a 1-3 minute video as a group by speaking, write a short story as a group with speaking parts, I gave them a paragraph to read (another teacher does this, so I thought I'd try it), singing songs that the kids chose, and more. All of these failed horribly in nearly every class. One class was successful with some of them because the students have the desire to learn without me and we had a lot of fun. But that's about 30/400 students that responded well. So my overall success rate is very low.Here's my question: How do I spend my class time with them? How do I encourage them to speak English using games when most of them don't understand what I'm saying or sometimes don't care about participating?I've seen ESL games online but they're often far too easy and uninteresting for the middle school students I teach.

I feel like with these kids, you have to toe a very fine line of getting them to work with you vs hating you and causing even more problems. But here’s where my issues come. I have one child in this class who’s mother is a secretary at our school. This school is a high performing charter but has the attitude of a private school. She cornered me in the copy room the other day and told me how the kid had apparently told his mom how my class was out of control and pure chaos. It’s not. We get our work done every day, no issue. She then proceeded to “give me the DL” on each of these kids and who I should call, including the assistant principal to come jerk them out of class. The third student she told me “he’s new here. He clearly doesn’t understand how we are here.” 😑 I told her politely thanks but no thanks and left. I specifically chose this class for my first observation bc they participate and answer me unlike some of my other classes. Is it energetic and like a bunch of puppies? Absolutely. But I much prefer that over a dead silent wall of nothing. So my AP came to do the observation and the kids were better but still energetic. I tried a Jamboard thing bc we’d just used it at PD the day before and I liked it. Some were off task, playing with the features, having side convos, but I addressed it every time. Responses: “yes ma’am, I’m sorry.” We finished what I’d planned for. My AP later cornered student 2 in the hall and asked him “is your class always like that?” He was upset bc he’d asked me if they’d acted better and I said yes. He came to me later and said “idk if we’re in trouble but Ms. X said this to me today.”She and I discussed the class at my pre-observation and she was so adamant about calling home or calling her so she can come get them. There is no detention room option. It’s I handle it, Parent handles it, straight to ISS which is sitting in admin’s office all day. I don’t agree with this at all. Unless we’re talking about blatant disrespect, violence, etc. While these kids are being obnoxious, my comparison of them to puppies is accurate. Nothing they’re doing is out of malice. It’s just like they don’t fit into this tiny little neat box of “well behaved student” the school likes to tout. When I discussed this with a coworker, she asked if one of them was black and student 3, the new one from an inner city school, is. She said this school claims to be diverse but rides it’s minority students hard. I’m dreading my observation results. My brain is catastrophizing to it being my lowest one ever. How do I have this conversation with my AP about our clearly different opinions on behavior management without getting fired? I don’t want these little robot students who refuse to participate or make jokes or be silly. How are we supposed to act out Macbeth later on with students like that?Anyway, thanks for reading.",teaching1694860067.0,Is it normal for a language teacher to not speak like a native ?,"Hi,I'm a young teacher and I graduated in Language Teaching (with very good grades). Before I started teaching, I thought I would be qualified for it. The problem is, when I have to talk for a long time or when I have to write essays or messages in my target language, I often don't sound like a native. I won't make big grammar mistakes, but will misuse a word or speak, a bit like a textbook quite often. I think it's because of the teaching of languages in my country. When you want to become a language teacher, you have to take a bachelor/master degree in Language Teaching. Those courses are perfect for learning pedagogy and grammar analysis, but we have almost no occasion to practice the language. As a result, I know I'm quite qualified to analyze and explain the language, but my speaking skills are not close to the skills of native speakers.Is it a normal, well-known problem among non-native teachers, or am I just not skilled enough to teach ?P.S : English is not my native language, and I don't teach english neither.",teaching1694873267.0,What to replace lectures with?,"This is my second semester teaching and lecturing is killing me.

Tests on units as they’re repeated.I know most of the kids aren’t reading the book and just scanning it to answer their questions and so I make these powerpoints to lecture so I know they get ALL the information needed but most of them don’t even take notes or participate.Idk how to enforce reading the book and I feel taking PPT notes + reading is the best for really learning the material.Their typical homework for a chapter is usually end of chapter questions (10-15) which is like a mini quiz and I have them justify their answers in a sentence or two.

We have focused on read alouds, fine motor, and social-emotional learning. As far as academics go, we have been working on recognizing and constructing their names and counting to ten. My SPED and Pre-K team have reassured me that I am doing good, but I’m just worried I’m not doing enough. My IA, who was in the classroom last year, has commented that she doesn’t agree my lessons and she has gone off and made her own assignments without asking me (such as cutting out the first letter of the students’ names and have them draw on them or painting with corn on the cobs). I am more than willing to modify our activities if she has an idea, but I just feel a little self-conscious that she doesn’t like my lesson plans so much she went off on her own to do something else. It makes me worry that I am not doing enough and that I am setting my kids up to fail.Tldr: Is it normal to feel like you’re not doing enough so early on?

I teach math and science.  She teaches ELA and social studies. My teaching partner is amazing and we work really well together.  We need resources, though.  I want to know how other partner teachers manage two classes. What are some different ways to divide kids?  How do you manage teaching lessons — combine content areas and do interdisciplinary units?

I need to better organize my space to accommodate all 43 kids.    I’ve looked up everything I can on “co-teaching” and it doesn’t address TWO classes of kids in one big classroom.

It’s hard seeing them come home everyday completely drained, never any time to do anything they want to do. Constantly grading, creating lesson plans, the works - you all know the deal. The added stress and anxiety of increasingly misbehaved students, evaluations by incompetent administration, induction, the fact that they are undervalued and undercompensated, and pressure to coach a sport and join several committees is all weighing heavily on them and their mental health. I do not want to see them go through it anymore.With that, we have determined over the last year that teaching is just not for my partner. They had high hopes and gave it their best shot but sadly it’s already time to hang up the towel. If the circumstances were different it would be an incredibly fulfilling career for them, but this is just not worth it and I don’t blame them.

Are there any consequences? Can the district come after them? Does my partner have any rights?B ) The district is paying for the induction process - would that potentially have to be paid back since it would not be completed?C ) Is there an amicable or recommended way to see if there’s a possibility of them being able to get released from the contract without causing an issue with the district or administration and possible retaliation?D ) My partner is looking at moving to another industry entirely, can they apply to those positions even while under contract?E ) Should my partner leave and potentially want to substitute in other districts in the future either part time or later on in life in retirement, would this cause an issue for them?I’m sure a lot of these details are laid out in the contract.

So, outside of dealing with the students who think me trying to run a professional paper like a newspaper office is the worst thing ever, I'm struggling with printing needs.I got some information from admin who paid for printing of the paper. However, I can't find that resource anywhere online. They said the previous teacher printed through Media One, however Media One doesn't have any newspaper printing online. The receipt they gave me said they printed through the Salt Lake Tribune (Utah), but I can't find anything on the SLT's website that indicates they print school newspapers, and I haven't been able to hunt down a contact number.I found a completely different website for printing news, but I think you have to use their templates instead of uploading one of your own, but it's way cheaper than what they were paying before on previous receipts, and I want to save the school/district money (especially since they had huge boxes of papers left over from previous years).Does anyone have a great resource for printing papers that you use for your school?

Most of the kids are 11, but some are a bit older at 15. Great opportunity, right? Wrong. Me lacking teacher training, and also prep work (I only come in once a week), I quickly found it very hard to control kids’ behaviour. They wouldn’t take me seriously. On top of that, they did not get regular classroom breaks. Because the facilities are not good, there’s no canteen or playground. They were stuck in the same room, only allowed to go outside for water, toilet or food. I essentially needed to teach them from 10am till 3:30pm with a small lunch break (they take the food and eat it in their classroom seats as well!).After a few weeks of coming in, I decided today I wouldn’t come anymore. I don’t agree with the practice of not having regular playtime, on top of that there’s a lot of power tripping in the school and physical punishment (not uncommon in my country). From this experience I did learn that I enjoy teaching in small groups as a tutor, as I enjoyed checking each student and seeing their progress, helping them on an individual basis. But complete control over a classroom intimidates me. Just wanted to put this out there and ask for any words of advice.

I started TAing as a freshman and am now a sophomore - still the youngest chemistry TA. The lectures are large - 2-3 sections (depending on the semester) of ~300 students each during fall and spring, and ~90 students for the summer.Chemistry is my favorite class I’ve ever taken (the class i TA is general chemistry, a lower division class). The past fall and spring, I TAed gen chem 1 for the same professor, and this summer i TAed gen chem 2 also for the same professor. However, this was her first time teaching gen chem 2 and my first time TAing for it, so we all basically constructed this summer class from scratch. My end goal has been to become a professor on the teaching track, so I can educate our future scientists, doctors, etc, and do chemical education research on the side. I absolutely love teaching higher education. I’ve been told that I’m great at teaching/explaining the subject. In the fall and spring, I got great reviews from my students and professor I worked with. She has continued to request me as her TA every semester, including this coming fall. In fact, I also have been teaching multiple sections of a pedagogy class since this past spring, to teach others about student learning and how to effectively teach. Only I and one other undergrad in the entire university have this position.This summer, however, I feel as though I did the worst job I’ve ever done out of all 3 of my semesters of TAing. A lot was definitely on me, as I do not remember gen chem 2 material anywhere near as well as I remember gen chem 1. I still reviewed the material/lecture slides and made the discussion worksheets/answer keys, to make sure I had a solid understanding of the material. I should’ve reviewed more though, as admittedly I sometimes had trouble answering student questions more than I anticipated. The funny part is, the students wrote great things about the worksheets, that they were helpful, not knowing I and two other TAs were the ones making them.Additionally, there were definitely times that I wasn’t fully present. Obviously the students don’t know about any of this, but I was struggling with my mental health a lot. It took the entire summer to figure out the correct medications, and I actually attempted suicide at one point - over a weekend, then came to TA on Monday as if nothing happened. I, however, shouldn’t have let that affect the quality of my work. The students needed me and I should’ve stayed more professional. Maybe I should’ve taken the summer off? I really don’t know.Although this was my worst semester, I have always been very passionate about teaching. I have had hundreds of students and can’t possibly remember all of them, but I still care about them a lot - I want them to succeed in the course and in future courses towards their degree. I can’t wait to see what they do after they graduate. I hope I’ve made a positive impact on them, no matter how small.Now that this semester is over, though, I don’t think I ever want to teach again. The students have turned in their course feedback (NOT anonymous), and some of them had some not so nice things to say. Specifically, that we didn’t always know how to answer questions. Yes, we definitely should’ve reviewed the material more. But, some said they weren’t happy that we didn’t have certain equations memorized like the back of our hands. Thing is, neither do the students. On exams, they get formula sheets, as all of us TAs did when we took the class. The reason being, we care that students know HOW and WHEN to use the equations, not if they remember how to recite said equation.  Another issue is that one concept in particular was apparently taught to us inaccurately when we previously took this course (from different professors), so all we had to relearn it. One student in particular said that he was annoyed because I spoke too loudly when helping students solve problems in class. Sometimes the other undergrad TAs and I would whisper to each other during lecture about refreshing our knowledge of the material so we could help students better. However, we sometimes whispered too loudly to each other about unrelated things, which was unprofessional and 100% on us. Students wrote in the feedback that we were too loud, and rightfully so. I didn’t realize they could hear us from their seats since we were a distance away. Regardless, that’s on me.I won’t deny that I should’ve done a much better job as an educator this summer. I should’ve acted more professional at times, and reviewed the material a little more thoroughly. But what kills me is that not a single one of the students let me know throughout the entire summer. I appreciate constructive criticism and if they have suggestions on how I can improve, I ask that they please tell me. Instead, all who had complaints waited until after the final exam today to express them. What breaks my heart the most is that as this was gen chem 2, I almost certainly will never teach these students again. There’s no chance for redemption. These students will forever remember that gen chem 2 was a class that negatively impacted their education. I care about all my students and I know that I failed them. I will have to live with this for the rest of my life. More important though is how the students feel, not me. They will maintain (and rightfully so), for the rest of their lives, that their undergrad gen chem 2 class was unenjoyable and unhelpful. I know that this was all my fault, and there’s nothing I can do to change that.I don’t think it’s super likely that any of my students are reading this. But if any of you are here, I am so very sorry that I did not educate you well. I don’t know how to make it up to you, but I hope the rest of your undergrad career goes better than my class did.",teaching1691095690.0,Is this a reasonable or realistic request?,"I’m in my second year in my district and I just found out that next year I’m expected to teach AM Kindergarten, then travel to another school to do In Class Support as a sped teacher in the afternoon.",teaching1691128152.0,Advice needed,"My plans were to become a RN out of high-school but things got turned around.

We loved to block scheduling this year and no one has even been able to tell me if the first day of school is an even or odd day.I was let in my room once to see the location and it is no where near my standards of what I would be comfortable teaching in. Books from other classes in the corner, a workout machine (why), old projects from 3 or 4 years ago, a lost and found box. It’s a mess.

I used to be a paraprofessional so I applied for para jobs again and some office positions. One of the first interviews I lined up was a dual interview at a middle school for an ISS para and one of the vacant office clerk positions there. The interview was overall pleasant. Panel interview with the two assistant principals and the principal. They were nice but the principal got a little unprofessional and basically spent the second half of my interview talking about how we’re in a national teaching shortage and that this county has vacancies in every school and in every subject. She noticed I have a bachelor’s degree on my resume and I confirmed and she once again went on a rant about their county’s alternative teaching program and how badly they need teachers and that I should consider it. I’m actually quite interested in teaching so I expressed interest and she told me to contact HR. The APs tried to reign it in and ask their portion of questions but she interrupted both of them at points to ask me questions like “What subjects would I be interested in teaching?” Once she stopped doing that, the APs finished the interview and  that was that. I didn’t get the office clerk position but she did call me about the para job. She actually offered me the job! She asks me for my references and I give it to her…she tells me to expect a decision between today and tomorrow.I just got an email saying she’s rescinding the offer. I don’t know what to think. My application was tight. These references are some of the best I’ve utilized and they always do me good. I’m kind of pissed but also kind of relieved. If this is how she runs things, I’m sure working there would’ve been an adventure. I’ve gotten a couple of other interviews so fingers crossed on those.

Should I be breaking the rules and giving whole-class ‘lessons’ to the 20 or so kids who are a similar level to save time? My reading planning is already so tight, I don’t know where I can trim the fat. Should I (seriously) be ‘becoming a YouTuber’ (read: putting up video lessons every alternate week for some groups)? My school has a strong expectation all the work is personalised, so a relevant video wouldn’t cut it but a video of me rephrasing a relevant video would. Our students have devices.All the advice about large class sizes online tends to be for older age-groups that include a decent number of confident readers. It also tends to assume you have a classroom where you set the rules, rather than 46 students you are responsible for in a big barn-like space with plenty of other students (and other teachers who are also juggling big, complex classes) in it.More Info: - We are in a Modern Learning Environment, so these children aren’t in a classroom with me where I can necessarily set whole-class routines. - They will be supervised doing independent work (that I set) when their group is not with me.- There are only 3 hours per week where I can provide direct reading instruction. I spend the other hour allocated for reading supervising other students.- They will come to me in five groups, because I split a group of 16 into two groups of eight. My largest reading group is 13.- The group which needs the most help (4 students) needs to be seen every day.- The class are reading at seven disparate reading levels.- Although these are new groups, I know all the students.- I am a normal classroom teacher and I already do reading sessions with additional small groups of students before school. - I do not have a teacher aide in the classroom.- My students are almost all beginner readers — not particularly independent even when I want them to be.- I always voice record instructions and provide visual examples for their work.Any advice would be much appreciated!

I also just got a job as an English-speaking content teacher at the elementary level at a public school. The school follows the CLIL (content and language integrated learning) model of bilingual education and is in Europe. However, I recently learned that two of my classes will be double level classes, meaning that two grades are combined into one class due to logistics. One class will be 1st and 3rd graders (ages 6 and 8) and the other 3rd and 5th graders (ages 8 and 10). This kind of arrangement isn't uncommon in this country, though usually it is done with grades that are only one year apart (2nd and 3rd, for example, or 4th and 5th). I'm a little perplexed about how to orangize myself and teach, particularly with the 1st and 3rd graders. For example, math standards for these two ages are fairly different. I know all about differentiation, but how, realistically, do I do that? I will also be working with students ages 3-5, which is a group I have zero experience with.

I love public speaking and explaining things and seeing the light go on, so I'm not super worried about that part.But at the same time, this will be C level (in my country there is C, B, and A) which means that these pupils have specifically not elected to raise the level, i.e., they most likely aren't (by default) interested, just want to get through it, or outright have a fear/hatred of physics.

It's leading to unbelievable frustration for me (M43), my wife (F45) and my reader (F10).Background on my reader:She was in her districts gifted program for ELA.  Up until the second half of this school year, she had always enjoyed reading and getting her to read independently was never an issue - she generally always had a book in hand or on her tablet and was an eager reader in general.  She was reading well above grade level (according to our school's librarian, who is a friend through Girlscouts, my wife is the Troop leader).Background on what's changed:Our elementary school is fairly small, 5 classes of 4th graders, 20 kids each.  The district does ""track"" the a ""beginner"", ""middle"" and ""top"" category, with the low and high ends having 20 kids each.  This tracking starts at 1st grade and my daughter was in the ""top"" grouping up until halfway through this year.  She started having more challenging books sent home with her, but nothing she couldn't handle.  She made it a point to look up words that she didn't understand or at least ask an adult for meaning of a word or phrase if she was having trouble.Christmas break happened and it all fell appart.  Nothing substantial changed in her school or home schedule and all of a sudden every required book was half read and her ELA grades started dropping.  She started really struggling in her reading group and other readers in her grade that couldn't keep up with her all of a sudden were thriving.The second half of the year was full of frustration and tears.  She's regressing to the point of hating the reading anything.  Classmates are passing her in all aspects of reading and her test scores had really suffered.  She even dreads going to her library class (formerly her favorite special class).  She's was removed from that ""top"" track class and moved down, which really hurt her confidence.The worst part is that we (my wife and I) can't seem to do anything to help.  We've had conversations with teachers that go no-where, one conversation leading to a teacher telling me ""Well, it doesn't click for some kids"", which (for all teachers out there) was exactly the wrong thing to say to a frustrated parent.Is it OK to let her walk away from reading? She's going into 5th grade, which seems like a pretty important time to lean into reading.  ELA is the only academic activity she's interested in before this year, she struggles a bit with math.  Should we change classes or schools to try and get some mojo back?  Our issues with teachers at this school have been ongoing from last year. I don't know what to do if anything.

It was totally unconscious on my behalf, probably even bolstered by the fact I'd slept 3 hours on that night.I'm quite confused by the situation, part of me understands because indeed it was risky as I didn't take into account the background of the students, but the other is dismayed as I just know that I had absolutely no bad intentions in mind.I don't even care too much about the collaboration itself, although it does bum me out as it was quite solid prior to that. The worst is, this stupid shit could damage my reputation.I guess for my own conscience, I'm interested in hearing what you think about it.EDIT: All moral claims aside, I think the gist of the issue is my lack of professionalism, making for a dangerous lack of boundaries.

I taught fourth grade for about 15 years and for the last few of those years I knew that I couldn’t be a classroom teacher forever because it was so hard and stressful so I started making plans to get out. I got a 48 credit Ed specialist degree in educational technology, and I switched schools to become a technology cluster teacher at a different elementary school. And I did that job for five years. I was pretty happy as a technology cluster! The kids loved me, I did tech support for everyone, the principal kept hiring these terrible college tech interns who didn’t know anything. and putting me in charge of training them, and I did my best. I set up a ticketing system for people to request tech support or printer ink resupplies, things like that. I created a school website, which is one of the goals the principal had when she first hired me.But for this coming school year, our enrollment has dropped, and the principal only needs eight cluster positions. And she decided that tech is “not necessary” so she eliminated the position and assigned me to teach fifth grade. When I went to talk to her about it, she was very sympathetic, she knew how much I wanted to be a technology cluster and not a classroom teacher, but she also thinks that maybe we don’t even need a technology teacher, because the classroom teachers do so much technology in the classrooms already. This is not remotely true of course. Every period of the day for classroom teachers is micromanaged, every class on a grade does the same reading lesson, the same writing lesson, the same math lesson, the same read aloud pages in the same read aloud book. Every lesson is scripted, and you have to do it exactly as written, and none of it leaves any room for technology. All the classrooms do have laptops for each kid, which is a project I was in charge of over the last few years, deploying all these new laptops, getting rid of obsolete ones and making sure every classroom got what they needed. But the only time the classroom teachers use these laptops is for MAP testing at the beginning and end of the year. (Oh, as the tech teacher, I did all the trainings about MAP testing and taught everyone how to use the teacher console.)I don’t want to be a fifth grade teacher!! I’m coming back from sabbatical this September, so I already have to be observed 4 times by my administration, but since they know I’m new to fifth grade they’re also gonna have the literacy and math coaches up my a$$ all year.

(I have nothing against fifth grade or my actual future class, they are great kids and the other fifth grade teachers are super nice.)I’m just really devastated. I was going to come back from sabbatical and be a technology teacher for five more years and then retire. I was really looking forward to that. And now my plan is ruined. I’m so sad.

I'm a new grade who just started working in healthcare. There are two things I've always thought I enjoyed in my life career wise - a job in healthcare and a job in teaching. I've always been very interested in both and I spent many summers volunteering in summer camps and tutoring kids and I always enjoyed it. When it comes to healthcare, it was always something I was really interested in and loved learning about as well. I went to college and majored in biology and graduated a few years ago. While I was doing that I had the opportunity to take a teaching class for STEM majors where we got to put a few lessons together and teach at an elementary school for the semester. I really enjoyed that. My whole life my family has been hearing me talk about how I want to go into the medical field. I really thought I did, so I pursued an allied health career and really enjoyed the schooling for it, but I'm a month in and honestly I am miserable. The work life balance is good in the sense that we work 3 12 hours shifts a week, but 12 hour night shifts are so draining and working with such critical patients where you feel like you can't let your guard down for a seconds is knocking me down mentally. I hate it, to be honest. I'm planning on moving to a different city early next year, so my goal is to stick to this for the next few months and then leave. That has me thinking though, if this is something I've always wanted and I hate it now that I'm in it, what would I do next? Then the thought about teaching came up again. Teaching has always been something I've wanted to do but I haven't gotten much support to go into it from family members, who always pushed for healthcare. What scares me is that I might have this idea in my mind and then once I go into it it's not what I expect, just like what is happening in my current job. I know teaching is hard, it's stressful, there's little support and compensation for it, but I really do enjoy working with kids and have always enjoyed being in classrooms when I've had the opportunity for it. I could teach middle/high school science with my bachelors degree, or go back to school for an education degree, but I want to make sure it's something I will actually want to do and really be exposed to it.Will substitute teaching help me?

I'm a student at Stanford studying Computer Science and a researcher at the Stanford AI & Education Lab ([https://piechlab.stanford.edu/](https://piechlab.stanford.edu/))  With the rise of generative AI, I've noticed that cheating is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, I don't believe that the solution to this problem is to surveil more. For one, AI detectors like DetectGPT just can't keep up, and never will. But more importantly, I think that shifting the focus from product to process and increasing meaningful touchpoints between a student and teacher is the key to cultivating greater trust – the true solution to cheating.  Over the past few quarters at Stanford, I've been experimenting with using oral conversation as a way to uncover true student understanding. Incubated at the Stanford Piech Lab, I am developing Speak On It!, a tool that uses AI to create personalized conversational experiences for each of your students.Our AI reads a student's essay and simulates a conversation with them, asking specific follow-up questions that probe them and reveal their true conceptual understanding. We then compile these videos and send teachers a series of warnings and highlights, helping them identify crucial missteps without spending excessive time grading.  As a researcher, I don't know what it's like to be a teacher. I don't enter the classroom everyday, trusted to empower and educate students. I know that the last few months have brought a lot of change to your workflows, but I would love to hear your perspective on this idea. Hopefully, it could be uniquely valuable for you and your class.

I apologize if this is the wrong flair or subreddit for this.  I just feel like writing this out will help me feel a bit better.  So, I apologize for the long read ahead!So, I worked for 6 months at a charter school.  I understand some love charter schools but I hated it.  I didn’t want a charter school.  It kind of just fell onto my lap.  And as extreme as it sounds, I think I am a tiny bit traumatized by my experience at this school.At this school there were students who physically fought yet were never suspended.  Some even threw chairs at a teacher and nothing was done about it.  The teacher told me that herself.  There were teachers openly saying people were playing favorites, and some other things I don’t want to put here (let's just say the teacher's mental state would be questioned if the admin heard what some teachers said).  There were no actions to consequences (shocker I know) and even referrals were a joke to these students.  Also, let’s not forget the threats students make to teachers.Oh, and I do not know if it matters but this school did not have a nurse or a guidance counselor.I was also hired at a bad time.  Personally, I had a therapist (I suffer from anxiety and depression but overall do very well) who kept bailing on me so I had to break ties with her and finding a new therapist was not working at the time.  Also, the school lost a teacher due to her getting injured on the job (I was the one who basically replaced her).  There were 35 students in a single class.  I was doing third grade in a co-teacher setting.So, not too long after I was hired, I was made aware of something very bad happening in my personal life.  I did not tell anyone what it was cause frankly, it was none of their business.  I was told to go home to take care of the situation.  I kept apologizing and admitting how embarrassed I was about the situation.  I also stopped crying until someone asked me what happened.  And admin kept telling me to stop apologizing and it happens to everyone.  I went back on Monday as if nothing happened.About two weeks later, the principal wanted to meet with me.  I asked if I was in trouble and I was told I was not.  However, they spoke to me about what happened and I was mortified.  I was told it was okay, I was not in trouble, and it was all over now.  But this meeting said otherwise.  I couldn’t believe I was lied to.  Also, I understand people may see what I did as not okay, please do not put that in the comments.  It was a very bad experience for me that went deeper than this but no need to get into that.After that meeting, I was scared at work.  Not scared physically but scared about everything else and being lied to.  I even started getting physically ill because of this.  I never knew if information I was getting from admin was correct or not.  That never happened anywhere else I worked.  I have never been so stressed or anxious that I felt sick at work or in life.  Luckily I’m not going back to that school.I had many interviews this summer and two schools offered me a position.  I won’t get into the whole thing but I liked one more than the other.  The one I did not prefer called me and revoked their offer because I stupidly put the charter as a reference and then mention that one thing in January.  I did not want that school but it was still hurtful from both them and the charter.I did a lot for that charter school.  I offered to take on jobs for people who were absent.  I administered the state test when another teacher couldn’t.  If I had to be out for a doctors appointment I made sure it was NOT on a day with testing or anything else important.  I comforted the students when there was a huge fire by the school and they were crying because it was in the direction of their home while other teachers told them to stop crying…twice!  I even comforted a student who was asking me if her mom was okay with my very little knowledge of pregnancy (her mom was 8 months pregnant) because her mom’s “hands got bigger and veins got smaller.”  They also told me they missed me when I was absent and asked who was going to take care of them when I was not there.  I also had students feel sad when I was teaching small group lessons and they did not want to leave my table when it was time to switch groups.  Clearly, I did something right.It is a shame they took one bad day, lied to me about it, and used it against me.So I called the other principal (the school I wanted to go to) to explain what happened and to be transparent.  She said it was not an issue and to just send a different reference.  She told me one reason she really wanted me was because of my empathetic nature and she told her APs and the grade level team about me.  They were very excited according to her.  So I will assume that whoever calls references will not call the charter school.  I just don’t want to be lied to again.  All I want is to forget my experience and restart at a new school, in a grade I actually think I will thrive in (Kindergarten), with what seems to be a half decent admin.I want to make it clear that I usually showed a bubbly personality in front at the charter school.  If i was not bubbly I often looked ""neutral"" but not sad, like when I was grading tests.  I said good morning and smiled when they walked into the room.  I rewarded the kids with stickers in the morning based on the previous day's behavior.  Those kids loved that!  I made plenty of (appropriate) jokes with them.  They told me I was the ""best"" or ""funnest"" or ""nicest"" teacher they have had.    The Charter school knew I was planning on leaving for many reasons and wished me luck and everything, then they destroy my luck.  Also before anyone asks, I did have a formal evaluation and I did perfectly fine on it.  There were also students who knew of me but were not in my class who wanted to say hi, give me hugs, and whatnot.  And I have a bunch of notes and drawings from those students I intend to keep.  It is not their fault that the admin there was awful.  I was not all that terrible.And I get references do not check about that but it is sad one unfortunate event (basically) out of my control caused this.The school who no longer wanted me did not give me a chance to explain my side of what happened.  I could have lied and said that never happened but I admitted to it.  If I knew that one day six months ago (again where I was lied to) would be that big of an issue I would have not put them as a reference.And admin did ""hype up"" the situation from what I heard.  I just decided not to argue with the principal.From the school that offered me Kindergarten, I received the onboarding packet, and information of what I need to do before the first day of school.  I guess I am just a bit nervous something will go south all because of 30 minutes back in January.  Also I want to state I know not everyone is the same.  Some principals would have seen this as me being awful but others would have seen it as me being human.So, again I just wanted to vent.  But if I could get some words of encouragement or even advice or tell me if you went through something similar that would be greatly appreciated!

As I come to the close my arduous music education degree, I slowly realized that being in the bottom 5 states for teaching is not normal, especially when juxtaposed with the astronomical costs of living in major cities that even do have good supports (i.e, Orlando, where you MUST have a car and rent is kissing 2k even though your take-home is violently making out with 40k). I am coming from the state's (if not one of the nation's) strongest student music educator programs, and will be licensed to teach music in Florida.Foreground: I am earnestly looking into teaching in Massachusetts, particularly Boston. I have done a lot of reading from accounts of teaching in Boston and the job potential, but I also keep in mind that people who post on Reddit aren't necessarily the strongest reflective population (including me). **I would appreciate any advice surrounding:*** If I am licensed in Florida, do I need to retake all my certifications for Massachusetts? * Should I go to grad school in Boston, right after my undergrad, then teach? \[I am very interested in research and have minors in both Mathematics in Statistics.\]* Does anyone have experience in relocating and job interviewing in different states during a Spring semester?* How do teachers apply for apartments when they are in between their student teaching and their next job?* In general, how do first-year teachers compete with more experienced teachers? What certificates or trainings can I do on my own that can help? I am fluent in French and plan to be fluent in Spanish by the time I graduate.* What is it like teaching in the northeast? Curated placard outside of the painting: I would discuss these with my school, but they have a **strong** teach in Florida mentality and don't really want to help; even mentioning grad school to them prompts them to say to just continue my Master's at the same school. Their attitude makes sense, considering their reciprocal relationship with the state, but it limits students seeking opportunities elsewhere and closes off conversations that could be shaped with their knowledge. I digress.Thank you so much for your advice!",teaching1687892332.0,How do you memorize what to say during lecture without holding notes?,"How do you remember everything you need to mention during a lecture?

I ended the year with having to take a medical leave for my health. I don’t want to get deep into it but I have recently gotten a medication change and I feel brand new. I am no longer suicidal. I thought i was feeling this way because of the school environment (admin) but I was also battling my own demons in the side with my mom dying. I felt like I was thrown into a pit to teach and I felt like I wasn’t getting enough guidance this year. I felt blind going in. This was my first year teaching. Everything I learned in school was completely opposite of what they expected. I felt that admin did not like me very much. But I got an email with a roster showing where the teachers will be placed for the next school year and I was on it. I truly thought they would fire me because I have had a few medical emergencies throughout the year and they haven’t acted kindly to me. I know that’s against the law to fire someone over their disability. The only thing was that I wasn’t sent the email with the roster, I seem to have been left out. My friend just sent it to me. Do you think it was on purpose so I could get fired? Maybe I’m overthinking this. I also wanted to ask your opinion on a TA position I got that is closer to where I live and the school is my dream school to be a teacher at. Half pay though as my current teaching job. I am trying to move out and it’s tough with a TA salary. I heard it takes two years in the city to get back on Long Island. I am going on Thursday to the Bronx to pick up some of my things because I don’t want them to break during summer school when I’m away. What would you do? I feel like the medication change helped significantly as to where I am functioning again. I want to go but I’m unsure what to do. I write a pros and cons list and it’s still pretty hard. Take the TA position or go back to a “tough admin” school? Everyone at the school says the first year is the hardest because they don’t give much help.

One of my students (NOT Tom) wrote down 'honest', and next to the sentence he wrote down: 'I wouldn't agree with this.'

My Watch Later YouTube list is ridiculous.I am not denying that it is a literal dopamine surge when I find something (especially something free!) that I would love to use in my classroom. Unfortunately it is always a rabbit hole. I try to keep my files organized, but it is just too much to stay on top of it all. I could be doing laundry or chores but one hour turns into five really quickly when I'm looking at school related content online.I want to spend my time more wisely and to catch up on sorting on everything I have accumulated so far. I just keep catching myself reverting to scrolling for any free resource or idea that I would love to implement in my classroom. I know my urges to constantly get better and to learn from others are totally irrational and not being applied appropriately. It is just a neverending quest that has too many rabbit holes. Reading about strategies and ideas feels good and is easily justified (correctly or not) because in my mind I'm working on growing my professional practice. Finding free resources provides the same high as someone who gambles hitting the jackpot. Rationally I know it is a time sink and every day that I initiate anither download only make it worse on myself to ""dig out"" of all of these materials. Even if it was only 1 file at a time it would use up valuable time downloading and placing the file into the correct folder, but one file inevitably leads to 20. One video serves up 10 more. One article becomes a dozen. What a silly compulsive addiction!I've tried substituting other hobbies like reading fiction or magazines or binging Netflix or baking. No matter what there is an ""itch"" in the back of my brain that says I've missed some great idea or info or file that would be perfect for me to use. I know that's not necessarily true, but it feels true and if I give in and check then wouldn't you know it, someone DID post something amazing on their blog, or there is a news article about education today, or someone made a video about how to create a digital resource that I know my kids would enjoy.

I'll have a timer on the board), initiate the first design swap. Each student will exchange their design with the other student.* Continuation of Design   * With the swapped designs, instruct each student to continue working on the design they received from their partner. They should build upon the existing design, adding their own creative elements, and making any desired modifications.* Design Swap 2   * Once they have further developed the designs, initiate the second design swap. Each student will exchange their design again, receiving back their initial design.* Finalization and Refinement   * With their original designs back, ask each student to review and refine their own design based on the changes and additions made by the other student. They can incorporate any interesting ideas or improvements they discovered during the design swap process.* Discuss   * Did you like the changes your partner made?    * How would you improve their design?   * How could you have improved how you continued their design?Thanks for reading my wall of text!

Have all the parents pay a subscription-based tuition for each kid, where if their kid is good at History, they can pay for the advanced history subscription where the teacher is paid a little bit more and teaches beyond the bare basics. So for example, in basic history you would learn about the essentials -- the constitution, the founding fathers, etc. In the advanced history subscription you'd learn about more advanced stuff like how Canada was formed, how barrels were invented and other countries.They should stop requiring a Master's for such an easy job.

While I've been genuinely enjoying my job and all the responsibilities that come with it, the mixed reaction of students is something that I'm starting to get concerned about.I usually use the blackboard as well as my self-made notes and PowerPoint presentations as my teaching materials. I make it a point that I try including examples that the students can relate with. Furthermore, as it was my first year, there have been times when I struggled with syllabus completion as the syllabus for technical subjects tends to be vast and at times we get carried away teaching concepts in depth.For most of my classes, the responses I have received were really good considering it was my first year. The students were extremely open with me, and I could make out that they were engaged during my lectures and found it interesting. Furthermore, my rapport with students in these classes was excellent.However, I cannot say the same about this one other class (this was an extremely technical subject). As this was my first year, I made it a point to revise all topics at the start of my lectures, which would take some 10 min from the 1 h 40 min lec. I also have been consistent in asking students at all times whether they've understood the concept, and I used to ask them questions regarding the same. If I feel that they got stuck at a certain topic, then I would go over the same again. For enhancing student engagement, I used to ask students to do some reading on topics that although were not thoroughly explained in the textbook, would help them in understanding the subject better. However, bearing a handful of students (only 4 or 5 to be honest), none of them seemed to actively prepare for the same. Moreover, owing to multiple lectures, this class used to be scheduled for 7 am. Several students stated this to be to early and ended up not attending whenever it was a morning lecture.I took one mock test after completing a considerable chunk of the syllabus, however, only 1/4th of the entire strength turned up for the same.Regarding this class, I have recently got subtle hints that the students were not comfortable with my subject overall. Upon some self-reflection, here are some points I feel I should be working in so that I can try to avoid any such issues for this academic year:1. Owing to some recurring health and personal issues, I had to cancel 5-6 of my classes, which I would cover up later. However, I believe I should work on not repeating this behavior by taking good care of my mental and physical health.2. Be more organized in terms of what all needs to be covered in class and plan my lecture more meticulously. I believe since this was my first year, I could have planned slightly better so as to manage my lecture timings well. Covering the syllabus in rush at the end would not really be helpful to students either way.3. Maybe have one to one conversations with students so that they can freely tell me if there are any genuine issues that they could be facing. It could be that the students do have some constructive feedback to share, however may not be comfortable doing so in front of the entire class.Please suggest if there's anything more I should be doing. I definitely need to improve as a teacher, that's for sure. However, I would appreciate some pointers that would help me here😅.

I’m currently living in Florida and am 19 with my AA degree. I’m about to start an online WGU bachelor’s of science degree program in elementary education, then will take all the necessary steps to gain my licensure including student teaching and extensive testing. Being fingerprinted and having an FBI background check run is a huge part of this process, and for WGU I’ll need to gain licensure first in Utah (due to Florida being a reciprocity state and WGU being located in Utah), then in my home state of Florida through the DOE, and then do more background checks for any school districts in which I may apply for work. Over a year ago I made a big fuckup for which I am incredibly remorseful for, and shoplifted from a Walmart which landed me a Notice to Appear and I was charged with a second degree petit theft misdemeanor, but I was offered a pre-trial diversion program and never convicted of anything. Fast forward, I am now getting it expunged with a lawyer and the whole process should be wrapped up in ~6 months. I know that even with expungement, teaching associations can see my charge and arrest in a background check. According to all state sites, it is not a disqualifying offense due to the fact that it doesn’t involve children, violence, drugs, and I never had a conviction. I would really like to teach and my attorney wearily told me that the state is so desperate for teachers it likely won’t be a problem, but I am having doubts.

Hiring managers still care more about a legit degree - even if it is more theory than application- than some no name “academy.” You will receive rejection letter after rejection letter stating you lack experience. 4. “The average ID leaving AIDA makes $80,000 because they are better prepared than many working IDs” - false. Because you have no experience, you WILL only be considered for entry level positions. Entry level average is anywhere between $50,000-$70,000. You will likely be rejected from even entry level because you lack legit experience and they have never heard of AIDA. Those stupid badges mean NOTHING to the rest of the world.The program is ridiculously overpriced. You can get legit college backed certificates now that are cheaper and actually accredited.

Of the 3 grades that I work with, I grew closest with the 8th graders. Most of the classes I was in were 8th grade, so it comes to no surprise that they’re the ones I meshed the most with. Last week they promoted and I have been having a hard time. I’m not sure if it’s the individual students I’m having a hard time seeing grow up, or if it’s just because it’s the first class I’ve sent off to high school. The hardest thing is I keep thinking “do these kids know how much they impacted my life? Do they know how important they are? Do they know I’m always rooting for them?…”. Then I’ll think “no worries, I’ll just tell them on Monday”. Except there is no Monday, and there is no after summer break because they are all moving on. I’m having a hard time accepting the fact that there are words left unspoken and whether or not they left middle school knowing I am proud of them. I’m excited for the new school year because I have also enjoyed working with the 7th (now 8th) graders, but I do worry about “living in the past”. I know a lot of teachers talk about having a hard time letting go of their first class/the first class is so special, so I thought I’d ask for advice on how I can get over this little slump I’m in.",teaching1686531829.0,The Power of PLAY in Leaning!,"Have you ever wondered as to why we stop using play for learning once we grow into adulthood? Play is a powerful tool, unleashing our creativity and helping us to learn complex matters faster. Maybe we think games are addictive. Maybe we think they make people violent or they are simply a waste of time. But they aren't. We must not confuse the content of a game with the medium of play. Some games can be violent, mind-numbing and addictive. But play itself is a very powerful positive tool, if used with care. What if we went ahead and applied these powers to real-world problems?Let me know your thoughts.Reference:  [Prof. Dr. Fabian Hemmert's TEDx Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrdtqWnql_s&ab_channel=TEDxTalks)",teaching1686513809.0,Am I crazy for leaving a job I like for an Admin I don’t?,"am a middle school educator, at a small urban charter school.

For a SUPER long story short (My grandmother mentioned I should write it in a book), I was upset because I did ultimately enjoy my job, no matter how stressful it felt and how low my low points felt. I liked most of the people I worked with (sadly not really in my department.. music, which makes that hard).However, today just felt so annoying.I had put my notice in in March and ultimately satisfied with that decision. A couple things happened within the last month where I really felt that I could barter for a full time position. But that was not the case. I asked for an exit interview, and my Head of School scheduled it for today. On Zoom (11:30). I told them I needed to come in because I wanted to finish organization of the music library & needed to grab the rest of my belongings still.There was this weird hesitancy of Why I would even need to come in.We are at a new building. I don't have a key to get in. So I waited for someone who could get in. Fine.  The music office was locked (my stuff was there because I had no classroom, but plenty of music), so I needed to ask to be let in. No greeting from that person. I heard her mumbling, but I could not make any of it out, and I couldn't tell if it was about me.My head of school literally asked ""Why are you here?"" like I didn't email her and tell her I needed my belongings. and she responded with ""you're not taking any music?"" Super fishy.I then went to look for another teacher and then I ran into her again and she said ""what are you doing? Are you just staying here?"" like I didn't belong.I just didn't get the vibe. Like.. I am still contracted until the 15th, but I feel I am trespassing. Honestly, I just set up some schedule-send emails, one basically saying ""I am cancelling the meeting. Thank you."" with the few thoughts I was going to discuss anyway. I didn't want to sit there with this 'shut out' feeling.I had seen a couple of staff members I wanted to say goodbye too, and since I was already in a low place, I ended up crying when saying goodbye to some. Which I didn't want to do. I reacted involuntarily (It's some sort of trauma response that my sibling also has). I wanted to positively say goodbye.I'm frustrated by it because it's not like I phoned it in these last three months. I worked hard. I was dedicated. I showed up (unlike some). I just felt like they already had washed their hands with me and they just didn't fucking care. I've never left any position (most being temporary anyway) where my supervisors shut me out. They all genuinely wished me luck. This school felt so much the opposite.&#x200B;Extra: It seems the culture of this school when a teacher leaves. I can only think of maybe... 3 teachers that didn't get dejected in some way.My predecessor actually left on INCREDIBLY bad terms. She put in a two weeks notice and then slandered the school by name on social media (Students followed her accounts). This was all mid year. I got to clean up the pieces.Other teachers to leave on bad terms for whatever reason: The Piano teacher, an English Teacher, 2 math teachers, a history teacher (kind of), a science teacher, two special ed teachers, our guidance counselor, our theater teacher most recently. That is 11 of about 15 staff members. We have a small staff of about 20 or so. Our art/french teacher last year was somewhat fishy, and it wasn't pleasant seeing her go.I'm not necessarily leaving on bad terms, but today was definitely a thorn in my side, and it left a sour taste in my mouth. Though with my email, I think I definitely did not leave on a positive note. Maybe my fault there.They locked me out of accounts almost immediately anyway (remember I'm supposed to contracted until about the 15th).&#x200B;Here's to hopefully getting a job for fall.",teaching1686090353.0,Rolling Start??,"I'm teaching 4th grade in a new school this fall, and I just learned they do a ""rolling start"" to the school year.

I'm the Course Leader of a University course that's directly in my field of experience (10+ years of visual effects experience in film/TV). I studied on the exact same visual effects course in 2007, and after working in industry for 10 years, I always wanted to go back and teach that exact course in that exact building. I did, and it's been the best 5 years of my career. Up until September last year.The course leader decided that he wanted to go back into industry, but also wanted to leave because of differences with the University. That left two of us teaching the course (25-ish per year group, 75 in total). It got worse; the studio that he now works at told him that they were after more artists. He then told my colleague about it, and - yup, you guessed it - my other colleague followed and went to the exact same place, leaving me on my own to teach the course from October.At this point, I was made Course Leader by default. Obviously, I was the only one. I never wanted the course leader role, I don't care much for the administration of academia, I just love teaching. What followed was 8 months of hell, teaching twice the amount of hours that I'm allowed to teach (contact hours), marking every assessment by myself, teaching every module, running every open day, giving post-assessment feedback to every student after they hand in, organising all pitches, talks, presentations, the end-of-year show, all on top of the crazy course leader workload duties that is quite literally a job in itself. By Christmas, I ran out of lectures and simply had to make some up on the fly. It completely broke me.To be fair, I had some HPL (hourly paid lecturer) staff come in to help here and there. They helped with the odd bit of marking and teaching, and the ones that did help were utterly fantastic, but it wasn't nearly enough to cover what the course needed to have, and what I needed too. This Friday just gone was the last day of term and we had our end of year show that I had to organise too - that's all of the displays showing students work designed for interactivity, editing a student showreel, discussing with the venue and organising the bookings, and so on.The evening was a success. The students loved it, we all had a great time. It was an emotional one as the students all got together and gave me a speech on how they really appreciated me sticking around, fighting through it and standing by them throughout the year, quoting ""we wouldn't have a degree if it wasn't for you, so thank you"". I had to try so hard not to cry in front of them. It was about midnight by the time the event was packed up and all equipment returned to the University, and on the drive home I pretty much gave into my emotions.I'm a very positive person and try to look for the positives in every thing I see. But I've now got serious anxiety and trust issues. It was my wife's birthday weekend this weekend, I'm going to the Le Mans 24h in a few days time, and we have a beautiful home. I should feel fine, but I constantly feel like the world is ending. Half of me wants to write my resignation; work on my showreel and go back into the film/TV industry. But nights like Friday reminded me why I do this job; for the love of teaching.It's worth noting at this point that the University (who will remain anonymous) are doing everything they can do support me. They've been great; the job advert is live for a new lecturer and they throwed more budget than the course had to bring people in to help. It's just circumstancial, and not the doing of the faculty in any way. I'm hoping that someone applies for the job that I trust. If they don't by September, I'll be leaving. I don't ever want to, and that would be an overwhelmingly upsetting day as it would feel like I'm being forced to leave my home, but I've always stood by the notion that nothing in this life is worth your health, and whatever you do, be happy. That's always number one, and while it would kill me leaving my dream job, I would for my health and sanity.

I've been a paraprofessional for grades K-2nd and helped with IEPs for individual 6-8th grade students. I taught English online to students in China for almost two years (ages 4-12 years old). I did some tutoring and assisted parents with their homeschooling during covid. I tried being a kindergarten teacher once in the US and it was super stressful. First time having panic attacks. I quit maybe 2 weeks after. Also, I now know that isn't the age group I want or like to work with. I've also attempted to be a ESL high school teacher and while I loved my students, I also left shortly after the start of the school year as I couldn't deal with the lack of expectations the school had as well as not having any of the support I really needed as a first year teacher in the classroom. I had to create all my lessons from complete scratch and find my own materials to teach. I felt like I was failing the kids and all the principal cared about was that ""as long as the kids like you"". Now initially I pursued education so that I could teach abroad and experience living in different countries but that ended up not happening as I found love, got married, and now I'm living in the USA (for now). I am now working as an school service rep - basically customer service, for a photography company that does all the photo things for the school districts where I live (8th grade promotion, fall pictures, spring pictures, class photos, staff IDs, sports, yearbook, etc.)While this job sounded like it'd be fun and a unique opportunity, it's been the most boring and unfulfilling job I have ever had.

Never really done full classroom teaching for more than a month.I got offered a 4th grade teaching position at a charter school. I actually applied for middle school English teacher but they felt (along with another school I interviewed for) that my personality and experience was better suited for 4-5th grade. I am just so terrified. Terrified that the stress will be too much and that I won't have any work-life balance. I don't want to quit on the kids this time. No matter what. But I may have some undiagnosed adhd as I deal with a lot of anxiety over perfectionism and I just break down easily when I feel like I'm not doing well... Granted the interview process I had with this school went really well. I don't have to write lessons plans, which is what I want. That takes a lot of the heavy load off my shoulders. They have a lot of professional development that I would get to do. Their coaching method (which I learned about and got to role-play during my interview) seems like it could really teach me how to be a better teacher... but I know it's going to be crazy hard and honestly, I just don't know if I'll be able to cope with the workload. But I want to do something worthwhile.

Additionally, it seems that many teachers understand their authority as declared (not needing to be earned or justified) and unassailable. But it also seems that the reality of our classrooms is showing us empirically that these assumptions aren't useful, if they ever where. In my experience (17 yrs), pedagogy built on a foundation of declared authority and demanded respect is fundamentally ineffective. The more I reject my declared authority the deeper I am able to get students to engage in a learning environment, the more I am able to get them to reflect on their place in the world and the fewer power struggles I have with them.EDITThank you everyone for your engagement. Here is what I learned.IMHOPracticing obedience is practicing dependence and subservience. Learning to make choices is what Education is for. Content (Math, English, Science, Art... ) is the context of education not the purpose of Education. Students need to practice making decisions within a community of care and practicing involves getting it wrong and receiving feedback they can internalize and use to get better. Responding to authority is nuanced and requires reflection and an understandingThere seems to be an assumption that the students that are the most challenging will not be in positions of authority in their future. This is a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is how Education works to suppress social mobility. If a challenging students chooses to be obedient they will become dependent on authority. If that student is in a position of authority in their future they will demand obedience because that is what they learned.And a question: How have we come to the position that we have? We are products of our experiences. As teachers we can assume authority. How did we learn to wield it.

Please be kind.",teaching1685255722.0,"(American) Teachers of reddit, what do YOU think society must do to value and change our education system today?","America has fallen behind greatly in education. I'm not a teacher (junior in HS), but one thing that really worries me is that America now has an entire generation of students who, in the grand-scheme of things, are more uneducated and very un-competitive in a global market due to a lower quality of education compared to the rest of the world. This might be unrealistic, but I worry that this issue will catch up to our society and overall hurt the US as a whole. While there are a multitude of factors contributing to this issue, I think one of the sole reasons is because Americans, in general, under-value education compared to the rest of the world. American culture has issues with anti-intellectualism, and I think that this is both a contributor to and a result of the widespread apathy and general disregard for education and studying (especially for the K-12 levels of education). We are rich enough as a nation to fix issues of funding (although bc of politics that will be incredibly hard to accomplish), but re-defining our cultural attitudes towards education might take decades. Additionally, some of Americas core social/cultural values (such as individuality, freedom), a direct opposition to uniformity, may result in a lot of social push back for any change that empowers the authority of teachers and experts. Parents are apathetic, students are apathetic and are not given responsibility. Overall, a teacher can be amazing, but a population of students who refuses to learn, study, apply their knowledge, and advance their education will render the efforts of that teacher useless. A parent who isn't taking an active role in the education of their child, especially of a child who is having difficulty or needs discipline, causes just as much damage. Some care, work hard, and thrive, but apathy is more widespread, curriculums have been made easier and pale in comparison to the curriculums outside of the US, so even the best of the best aren't really being empowered to their full extent bc of our system.Overall, it's a pretty bad situation over here. We shouldn't accept the bare minimum. In my opinion, in our increasingly competitive global market and world, the bare minimum of things will not suffice. For now, we are ok, but other nations are catching up quickly because the people of their nations are empowered by education and hard-work. If we do not fix this, I believe that we will soon fall behind and our powerful status as a nation will severely diminish as we are outcompeted (ex. Korea was able to go from one of the poorest nations in the world, to an incredibly rich and advanced society. Why? Because of education, they understood a societies success correlates directly to their education and  dove headfirst into it. It worked, and now, they are renowned for their innovations in technology and science. Use this logic in reverse, America, a global power, fading away due to an inability to remain competitive, low quality education, and an ignorant populace). This isn't me saying that Americans are dumb, nor me trying to conflate this issue. We might be more insular and ignorant, but we have every ability to reverse that. I believe that we are smart people but our systems just don't empower that, and we do not empower ourselves most importantly!!! Yes, we have incredible institutions and innovators, but those are not the majority. They cannot carry this nation, we all must.As educators with experience in the system, what do you think must be done to fix this? How can we re-define our culture to emphasize and cherish education as seen by other nations? Policy changes/radical movements/government funding/national standardization of education (this literally sounds impossible tbh since states control education but idk)?

Word has now spread. Parents are furious at the principal for withholding the information and I’ve been hit with a barrage or emails asking me why I am leaving, telling me they only signed up because they thought I’d be teaching their child, and asking if they should keep their children enrolled at the school.

Children will be children. They can be resilient but they do have a hard time bouncing back from the darkness in our society. From the politics to the numerous schools in the news to the violence inside the school, our students are faced with serious things that they really should not be. They can bounce back, but they are never given the chance to do so. They are constantly bludgeoned with the negative and when the only rays of light come from us it can be exhausting. We try to be that positive in their lives so they can thrive and succeed, but it is difficult to fight their darkness back while trying to do the for ourselves. We will succeed though.2. We are tired. We are drained. THis year has been difficult. To those that leave, I understand. It has been brutal. For those that are staying, we know that we need the break to be able to seriously recharge our lives and spirit. We will come into next school year opptimistic yet cautious. THis is understandable as well. The aggression toward teachers and school personnel is at an all-time high, and we are nervous. We will succeed though.3. IS it going to get worse? that is the question we are all asking ourselves. My opinion is that next year will be equally as difficult as this year has been. There will be more divisive rhetoric coming out against teachers and what we do. We will weather that storm however. We will be able to know that the students are reflecting what thye see outside our classrooms and we will stand tall and continue to be that guiding light for them to hopefully emulate. Again, it is going to be difficult. We will succeed though.4. We will going to still have to fight to have our voices heard. Well will have to scream sanity at the top of our lungs to beat back those that are trying to politicize education. The society that tells us we are a danger to their children but should carry guns to protect them will continue to yell and scream atr School Board meetings. We will still those angry parents throwing accusations at us for being human. We will stand tall and know we are doing right by the student. We will continue to educate our students with facts, reasoning, and caring. We will help them grow no matter what happens. We will succeed though.What I am going to say is this: This year has been difficult. Next year might be just as difficult. BUT if we stay the course and care for our students. Give them a chance to grow and thrive, we will be rewarded. Not by society but by the students we serve. Those students will remember us and continue to grow. THose students, whose life we have toucvhed, will be better for being in our classroom.Our career and our calling is to educate those in our society that need the best people our community has. We are NOT the bottom of the ladder, nor are we the top of the ladder....we are the ENTIRE ladder that helps every community, society, and individual climb to success. Never forget how strong we are as individuals and as a group.We will continue to succeed!",teaching1685114072.0,Course legitimacy,"Hi there!

I taught hs from 2008-2016 and then I moved to college.  Being a college professor pays garbage.  So since my college year was done April 26, I took a long term sub maternity coverage in my content area (family and consumer science) until the end of the school year to test the waters and see if I wanted to go back to Hs for the better pay.I can say I prefer hs to college because I have a very small group of college students so the three or four that I have that just absolutely suck stand out way more.  I like the shorter classes and I can say that 90% of the students I have in this coverage are genuinely nice students.  We’re getting along great and not because I’m just letting them sit there and do nothing, we are getting through the curriculum and they are doing very well.But holy crap, I share a classroom with one of the nastiest people I have ever met in my life.  Every. Single. Day…she chastises me over something wrong in the classroom.  Mostly about things not being put back in the right place, or don’t touch this or that.  For reference we teach child development with a preschool class 2x a week, so the class room is half a classroom and other half a room fit for preschoolers with a fridge, sink and stove.Most of her issues center around cleanliness, which to me is comical because I come in for the second half of the day and the classroom is wrecked.  I am diagnosed with OCD and anxiety and mess makes me crazy, so I wipe all the gross preschooler food off the tables and put away any thing out of place.  My class at the end of the day has the drill down that everything gets wiped down and all supplies go back to their home.  I’m the teacher that everything on my desk is at a perfect 90 degree angle.  So for her to be yelling at me about mess is rediculous.Last Monday, I was t-boned 2 streets over from the school.  Everyone was fine, but shaken up of course.  I couldn’t go in because my car was not drivable.  On Tuesday I felt like crap, I was super sore and upset that my car may be totaled.  I walk in and get a total dressing down about things left out the day before, such a mess blah blah blah…all in front of students!  She has a select group of favorites that she will do the mean girl whisper and laugh and then look at you which on a professional level makes me want to bang my head against a wall.  Yesterday I had a class of level 2 students, and only 7 were in school because it was prom.  One student asked if she could sit in front of the teacher desktop in the class with her own laptop because she felt like she could focus better there.  It is sorta tucked away and she’s a good kid, I have no reason to say no (there is no confidential info and the desktop was signed out of).  My class had such a nice vibe, the students are working on the year end research papers and we had super nanny playing on the projector.  The other teacher comes in and when she notices my student witting at the teachers station she starts interrogating her about why she is sitting there and not at a desk.  I intervened and said I gave her permission to sit there and she was using her own laptop.  After she left all the students were upset.Today I let a student have part of her lunch because she missed lunch due to testing and she flipped out about how there is no eating allowed in the room (even though we have preschoolers having lunch in the room 2x a week??) because we have mice.  I just sorta stare at her at this point.The supervisor has apologized for her behavior on numerous occasions to me and I finally told her it’s not ok.  I know I’m a passing vessel, but if that had been a brand new teacher in that roll, they would quit thinking teaching just equals bullying.  The supervisor had the nerve to ask me if I tried smiling at her and saying good afternoon when I walked in at the classroom changeover.15 days left guys.

I first did a masters in anthropology at a university in China and have been teaching English at the same university for roughly the past four years. My plan for a long time was to eventually come back to the US and teach Chinese (I am fluent and have a bachelor's degree in it from the University of Mississippi). I figured I would go the private school route since I don't have a degree in education or a teacher's license. I realize this was overall probably a dumb plan, but I was young and stupid, and this is where I am now. There's nothing changing the past, and I'm looking forward to the future. I am passionate about teaching and would love teaching Chinese to highschool students, (preferably in TN/the Nashville area, as that is home, but I am open to other options). I know several private schools in the Nashville area have Chinese programs (or had some, but the teachers left), so my original plan was simply applying to various schools and hoping to get a job based off of my knowledge of Chinese and teaching experience. But now I'd like to see how I can make myself more competitive/open up more options for myself, but I'm not gonna lie, all the possibilities seem overwhelming. I have several questions and any advice would be extremely appreciated. I have no one else to ask, so I come to you.1. If I want to go the private school route, should I be looking at masters of education programs? I've been looking at some online options that I could do while I'm still here in China. (I'm estimating I'll still be here for at least another two-ish years as I'm wrapping up some personal matters.)2. If a masters in education would be good, then what kind? I didn't realize there were so many types and I'm not sure if any would be particularly relevant, or if it doesn't matter as long as it's a masters in education. Western Governor's University seems pretty popular on Reddit, but it looks like the only program that might apply to me is the Master of Science in curriculum and instruction, (others are degrees for teachers who have licenses, or for seeking licensure in other topics out of my field/interest) and I'm not sure how to know what a potential employer might think of that degree. Another online program that was recommended to me by a friend is a Master of Education in educational leadership from Trevecca Nazarene. But I'm also not sure what a potential employer might think of that if my (initial) aim is to teach, and not be a principal.3. Should I try to do a program where I can get licensure? If so, how? As said, WGU has some programs, but for other fields (primary school education, secondary school science, etc).4. Are their online licensure programs for teaching foreign languages? (Or is there not even demand for Chinese language teachers in public schools like there is for Spanish, French, etc?) So far the only program that I've found that offers licensure for teaching a foreign language (including Chinese) is from Peabody at Vanderbilt, but its hella expensive and must be done as a full time student in person.5. Or should I continue the ESL route and get an online degree with ESL licensure? (If there is such a program.) I think I would enjoy teaching Chinese (and being able to share with students about life in China/Chinese culture/my experiences there), but if there's possibly more money in ESL/more demand in public schools, I have experience there anyways.Bonus question (Tennessee specific). What are private school ""categories""? And do you need licensure to teach at certain categories vs others? I found a list of the categories on the TN department of education website, but can't seem to find a clear answer on if categories affects who they can hire or not.Again, any help is greatly appreciated!",teaching1684999049.0,Teaching empathy to a bully gr 6,"It's nearly the end of the school year and we're trying to address some challenging behaviors.

Willingness to share names of decent charter ( magnet? ) schools?,teaching1684792683.0,Need some advice,"So here is some background:I have 2 girls in elementary (3 next year)  and last summer, in July, I reach out to the principal and let him know I am doing a Bachelors in Elementary Education. I ask him if he has any positions available, like para or sub positions, for THIS current school year. He reaches out and says, ""yes! I actually need to fill a 1st grade teacher spot, would you be interested?"" I'm surprised because I don't have the degree yet and even though my state allows for provisional license, I don't think I qualified at the time. Plus, it would be really overwhelming for me. So I think about it but reach out to my friend who was a previous 1st grade teacher and she decides to take the position instead. He then offers me a site based sub spot for the year and a long term sub position in the middle of the year. I decide that's much better and I'll get a lot of experience. I do the long term sub position with zero support and I'm put on a really dysfunctional team. Which everyone knew but me. It was awful. No one was doing their job and often there wouldn't be any plans in and I had to create my own. With zero professional experience doing that. I pull 11pm nights constantly and the class is also an extremely difficult class with at least 5 boys who have ADHD. It was all just extremely difficult and I had zero resources. Because I was a long term sub I didn't get any of the resources first year teachers get. I was told by many staff members I rocked it and the kids test scores were actually really good. I did make great relationships with those kids. After that I go back to just site base subbing. The principal never saw me teach, never asked me how it was going...nothing. I request a meeting with him and the vice principal, letting them know my intentions and wanting a teaching position at that school next year. (I finished my degree at this time). They say okay, thanks for letting us know...we have to move teachers around and then we'll let you know what's available. It would be silly for me to teach anywhere else since Ill have a 5th grader and kinder coming in. It's 2min from my house and all my kids have done all their years there. Fast forward, I give him some time and reach out because I know who has jobs in all positions next year. He tells me he has nothing and I find out he gave one of the student teachers a job. Plus he hired 2 spots for 4th grade. I have way more experience than this teacher and have a reason to be there. I am so confused and have gotten zero explanation. He's friendly in most settings with me but I get so nervous around him. I actually don't care for him as an administrator but love the staff and know everyone. Should I ask what happened? Should I ask why I didn't get picked? I had told him I wasnt going to go anywhere else because my kids were here and he agreed it would be silly to pull my kids from the school and teach somewhere else. I keep finding out so and so has a para job next year or a sub job...I'm feeling like this is personal. But I seriously can't think of any reason why it would be.

Small talk with an unknown individual that turned out to be a principal turned into an on the spot offer teaching HS History for a position that was not even advertised. This school is in the suburbs and seldom has openings, and it is not a Title 1 school. Sometimes the best things come when you least expect it, especially considering that Social Studies is a saturated subject and always has fierce competition for the openings that arise.For any of you that are out there and unsure if you'll get a position for the next school year, these are my tips:1) You CANNOT give up. If this is truly your goal, you will find a position, IT WILL open up. People are hired and pull back at the last second, and it will be nearer to the beginning of the school year when you may get surprise calls. You need to be flexible with the area you are in.2) You must always remember that landing a job is NOT within your control. I have come to realize that most openings already have a person that will take them, and the position is posted because the law requires public service jobs to be advertised and ""competitive"". If it were up to us, we would all be living in a wonderland.3) ATTEND the job fairs. You might want to be at a desirable school but not have much experience, which means that others might have the upper hand. Take what you can if there is an offer, and remember, there is always next year. Once you get your foot in the door, it can make it easier to move around. If there is no opening in the school you want, you should get the contact information and at least make a connection with the administrators there from that particular school. If they ever see your name or face in the future, they will remember and will likely opt for you than somebody else. Takes me to number 4.4) Email and contact administrators in schools around your area. Demonstrate your enthusiasm for landing a teaching position for X subject, and the competitive skills you might bring. Something as simple as being bilingual or training employees where you work can help. 5) Talk to the union/association. Where I live, they are weak. However, they have a strong network of individuals. I reached out to a specialist that let me know about the openings that are NOT on the district hiring sites. Most of the time administrators want to hire people they know or that they have already screened, because it takes a long time for processing to occur. If you are to do number 3 and 4, it will make securing a position that much easier. Contacting HR helps SO much because they can guide you, and will ABSOLUTELY be willing to vouch for you and serve as a reference. I thought that I would just upload this because I see so many people get frustrated with the job search.

Who cares about summers off or a pension when you have to have to deal with working in this career field.*Now* I see why so many in the teaching profession warn prospective teachers and college grads to take their talents elsewhere. *Now* I see why more than fifty percent of teachers quit and flee the profession by their third year. *Now* I see why there is a teacher shortage. *Now* I see why there are hundreds upon hundreds of vacancies for teaching job positions. *Now* I see why teachers talk about crying in their car after their shift ends or wanting to get hit by a semi on their way to work.This is a horrid and dreadful profession and it is only getting worse.Allow me to list what I have seen and experienced during my time as a sub :\- **Oversized classrooms**. Every single classroom that I have subbed for has had a preposterously excessive amount of students. Being the only adult or teacher figure in such a predicament feels overbearing and makes classroom management virtually impossible because seldomly do that many students simultaneously stay on task.\- **Negative student behaviors**. Elementary kids will get on their Chromebooks and play video games all day regardless of what directions you give them. Middle school kids will shout sexual innuendos at each other, vape in the bathrooms, regurgitate dumb phrases and songs from social media, intentionally mock you loud enough for you to hear them and stay out of their seats all class period. High school students openly cheat, openly curse, openly skip class, openly tell teachers that they can't teach and openly hate being in school.\- **Short prep periods**. 40 or 60 minutes is not enough time to get a break away from teaching five or six consecutive classes or class content. It isn't enough time to gather yourself and prepare yourself for the next class or topic. Not only is the length of the prep periods minimal, but there aren't enough of them.\- **Excessive work load**. Bloated lesson plans and piles and piles of paperwork. Additionally, teachers are expected to act as prison wards (constantly checking to make sure that ID badges are on, constantly checking that phones are put away, constantly checking for vapes, checking to see how long students have been in the bathroom) and school psychologists (checking for signs of bullying, depression, poor nutrition etc).\- **Too much noise**. Having to hear people continuously talking for 8 hours a day is a dismal, melancholic experience. It's too much. Constant chatter, constant sound of chairs squealing, constant sound of sneezing, constant knocks at the door, constant ""can I use the bathroom?"", constant questions and comments. It is horrific. My eardrums feel like they are being assaulted any time that I am in a classroom.\- **Classroom odors**. I have yet to be in a classroom that didn't smell like a combination of used jock straps, spoiled hamburger meat and raw sewage. Maybe others have a high tolerance for putrid odors but I'm not one of those people. Classrooms and hallways stink and always smell like flatulence and dead bodies.\- **Micromanagement**. There is very little room to do your job. Not only do you have administration enforcing various draconian rules on you but you also have your students also watching you like a hawk. Anything you say or do, they will alert their parents and then their parents will come up to the school demanding that you talk to them during your prep period or after your contract hours.\- **Unrealistic expectations**. A large chunk of students do not care about school, don't even want to be there and put no effort in learning. Teachers are held accountable for that and told that if a child doesn't want to learn or cannot pass a class, it's because they did not motivate, inspire or build a connection with the child. Teachers are told to pass failing students and are told to meet metrics that are becoming more and more unobtainable by the year.\- **Too many extra duties**. Recess duty. Lunch duty. Carpool duty. Crosswalk duty. Hall monitor duty. Morning duty. Bus duty. Sponsor this club. Sponsor that club. After school tutoring. Before school tutoring. School dance chaperone.This was my experience and observation in the education environment as a substitute.

In addition to that, I'm a licensed paramedic in my state, have my bachelors degree & license in clinical social work, and also have my substitute teacher certificate. I work primarily in a high school, but there's a seperate K-8 building on campus with it's own SRO. I've dealt with an ""almost"" school shooter in the past. We pulled him from class less than 90 seconds before the passing period he planned to begin his attack during. He had dads handgun in his pants when we pulled him out. Dads rifle, an obscene amount of ammunition, and knives were in his locker. We all know that lockdowns are ineffective security theater, but the lockdown wasn't even called until after the passing period began. If the situation was just a little bit different, we were further away or he decided to leave class a minute early, children would have died. Conservative answer to this? Arm teachers, police in schools, harden the buildings. Principal is armed, and this is a hardened campus. Without going into details, ridiculously hardened. Police in schools? Yep, check. Hire retire military? Check - my partner in the grade school is a multi-tour combat veteran in Iraq & Afghanistan with special forces experience, more than one purple heart, and awards for valor in combat. None of that matters though. Just the slightest change of plans, luck, or time? People would have died. I would have responded, my partner would have responded, sure. Doesn't change a single thing. This is a child who was ready to die for his chance to kill as many people as possible, and there would have been a firefight in the middle of our local high school. Even if that firefight happened before he started shooting at kids, this is a high school. Walls aren't bulletproof, there's no safe backstop, humans aren't accurate. Kids probably still would have died, possibly at our hands not the kid. We train and practice on this too, and every disgusting detail of it. We help your children practice how to run for their lives, hide for their lives, and fight as a last stand for their lives. We practice stepping over and ignoring the dead and dying children, then finding the assailant and returning fire, and then searching for secondary threats. Would you like to know what else we practice? We practice triage, determining saving which children does the greatest good for the greatest number. Determining which of your children has been injured to the point of incompatibility with life, and then tagging their bodies as such so the limited medical resources aren't wasted on the corpses of your children. We then practice the working with the coroner and death investigation responses. We will tabletop the details of the recent school shooting utilizing our guidelines provided by the FBI, homeland security, and the secret service. What other country is that a normal sentence to say? While on the topic of conservatives, I'll discuss some of the other horseshit that's on my mind. One common thing is I've heard among conservatives, wanting police in schools to protect the rights of their children. There's many exceptions though, most notable of the two within just the first amendment: They don't want us protecting our children's first amendment right to freedom from compelled political speech in school, as solidified by Tinker vs Des Moines Community ISD, determined back when the Supreme Court was a respectable institution. They want children to be indoctrinated & forced to pledge allegiance to a flag representing values they may not believe in. They don't want us protecting the 1st amendment right to religious expression. They would like the establishment clause to be gutted, christianity to be instituted as the state religion, children to be indoctrinated into it, and free exercise of other non-conforming religious beliefs to be suppressed. Only their version of Christianity too. The version where idolatry is okay when it's guns or a flag. Indoctrination is okay as long as it's indoctorination for their points. Also better not teach about racial discrimination or their rights against it. No conservative truly gives a shit about mental health either until it's a useful diversion from the topic at hand, guns. People with guns kill people, at least in America. It's that simple. We can look at countries like Switzerland where people can be responsible with guns to divert from the topic of what's happening in America. But we aren't Switzerland. ""Guns aren't the problem, people are!"" Even if that's the case, when we have a population incapable of responsibility with guns, removing the guns is the solution. I'll openly admit to being a bleeding heart liberal. I think guns and conservatives are the main problem here. I'm absolutely, definitely not letting the left wing off the hook though here. There's a bit of fault for this shit on the left too. Gutting discipline in schools for ""equity"" and providing ""grace"" is apart of this. How the fuck is it equitable to allow school to be an unsafe, dangerous, out of control environment? That's just disadvantaging the often minority groups we serve. How the fuck is cultural sensitivity a valid excuse for that, and how is that graceful? Why is allowing & perpetuating the trauma that's apart of why we have school shooters the solution? I'm tired. I'm fucking exhausted. I'm tired of how this country is, I'm tired of extremists, and I'm tired of death. Signed, your local SRO",teaching1603921889.0,Dear students,"Have you guys always been this way?

One “C” in middle school isn’t the end of the world, and it’s much better to earn that C in middle school rather than in high school where the GPA counts more heavily. GPA isn’t really a thing in middle school until 8th grade. Your child should not have waited until the DAY BEFORE THE EXTRA CREDIT was due to begin it. Your child should know how to check and read his emails. Your child should know that he will not get credit for plagiarizing his assignment.

That ""anything"" didn't include 95% of what hit me like a freight train in just my first week. The kids that got dropped in my lap this year were beyond anything I ever expected. On day 1, I had a student (5th Grade ELA) stand on his desk and beat on his chest while screaming absolute nonsense. It wasn't even words. It was just guttural noise. This student proceeded to jump down and crawl on the floor across my classroom. All I could do was stand there and think ""What the absolute fuck is happening?"". This same phrase has now become a constant in my mind.I spent my first entire month crying after work on my drive home. Between the kids, constant crazy expectations, PD days everytime I turned around, and the ""can you help out with this or that"", I was dying. I seriously went to my doctor and asked him to please give whatever drugs, even experimental, you can to just help me handle all of this. *He didn't do that, but did adjust some of meds to help with my anxiety. My biggest problem was that I wanted to teach, but felt like I was being pulled in some many different directions that I wasn't even allowed to do my actual job. The night before I was about to put in my 2 week notice, it hit me. They aren't going to fire me for not complying to half of the shit that they are wanting me to do. I'm ready to quit, so being fired, isn't too much different (I know recommendations are needed on a resume, of course). I decided to teach, really teach. If our district office came by to look at my data wall, I was already prepared to tell them "" Dat a Wall ain't a happening"". I broke all of the stupid rules. I never had my students open their textbooks that I hated. I read 2 different novels and did activities with those novels that the kids loved. I refused meetings that weren't beneficial or related to my actual planning during my planning period. I also quit working, grading, or planning after school. My room or lessons aren't Pinterest perfect anymore, but that's okay.I was constantly second guessing my new approach, but I was happier. My students were also generally doing better. They were and are still crazy, but we've all developed a relationship in which we are able to manage it. So, did this work? As in, did my mandatory 9 week benchmark tests satisfy those above me? Did my craziness with the intention of doing what I felt was best for my students actually work? It actually did!!!! My 5th graders performed on their 9 weeks benchmark test higher than my class the year before. Their overall proficiency was higher than their beginning of the year benchmark and state test from last school year. 81% of all of my students passed that damn test too. My 5th graders also scored 15% higher on all aspects of the test compared to the rest of the district. TLDR: I said fuck the crazy expectations and just focused on teaching even if it meant getting fired, because I was already ready to quit.

""What's it like online teaching?"" ""Are you still working?"" ""Must be nice to have a break, haha""Switching to online teaching is a bit like being a chef at a fancy restaurant that flooded. Now I cook from a food truck, but my community expects the same dining experience.Normally, I carefully pick herbs and vegetables from the garden (that I grow myself), buy protein from various farms, and order in special items. I spent all year creating my menu and ordering all the food, but I had to throw out half of it because I can’t prepare it the same way in my food truck.I cook meals for 125 kids a day, 5 days a week. I set the table with dishes and cutlery that I carefully polish, and bring in my own flowers, candles, and tablecloths to make it a welcoming dining experience. I invite all of my kids (and even parents) to dine at my restaurant.44 diners do not show up, even though they said they would come. I can see them walking by the restaurant, but despite asking them repeatedly to come in and eat for free, they don't want to. I phone, email, text, and video conference with them and their parents, but it's like they've completely vanished.11 claim they don’t know where the restaurant is, despite dining here the whole year. I email them a map. They arrive. They claim they don’t know how to eat lobster. I show them how. Their parents phone and want instructions on how to eat lobster. I also show them how with instructions, a video, and several books on the subject. The kid decides they don’t like lobster, even though they haven’t taken a single bite. I offer them a different dish. They leave. Their parents complain that I didn’t feed them. They leave after the first week.12 complain about the food selection, even though I have carefully adapted my menu to serve vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, paleo, low-sodium, low-carb, gluten-free, and check for allergens for each kid. I went to several meetings and courses to learn how to make these dishes. Their parents complain because I didn’t have a keto plate. Two parents thanks me for the support with their kid's low-sodium meals. They leave the restaurant after two weeks, but I still have to call and see if they want to come and eat. I feel like an annoying telemarketer, they don’t even pick up the phone now.10 want me to cut up their steak into little bites and then spoon-feed them their meal. They ask every night for this, even though I've been working all year to try and get them to eat on their own. I can't serve other kids because I get tied up trying to feed so many individuals. Sometimes I will get lucky and can get a waiter to help me cut up the food, but with budget cuts, my restaurant can't afford that many waiters. I wonder why their parents haven’t taught them how to use utensils yet, but quickly find out that their parents have been cutting their food for them their whole lives. They leave after the third week.5 kids show up at 5pm, 9pm, 3am, and on weekends and want me to feed them, despite having my hours posted and well-communicated. I still feel bad for not feeding them.8 kids want me to deliver the food to them. It’s a bit more work, but I have no problems doing it. I adapt my menu so they get hot food, and I even use my own plates. When the waiters deliver the food now, they won’t answer the door. I never get my plates back.7 kids leave their food virtually untouched, only picking out the pieces they like and leaving the rest. Their parents want to know what their kid ate every day, even though they could simply ask their kid. Or check their dining app. Or their emails.12 kids show up when their parents force them, pretend to eat the food, but actually dump their plate into the trash can when their parents aren't looking. I ask them if they want another plate, but they don't respond. They show their parents the empty plate, and parents are too busy to notice. I don't blame the parents because I know they're stressed and overworked, but I still worry about their kids.16 kids show up on time, eat the food, and even say thank-you. They fill my heart so full I could cry. I want to hug their parents. I am so thankful for these students because they remind me why I chose to become a chef for a living. It's not a job, it's a career and a large part of my identity.Running the food truck is exhausting, but the relaxed dress code is a perk. I’m lucky because I don’t have my own kids to feed and nurture, on top of running the restaurant. I don’t know how those chefs do it. I hope I can go back to my restaurant, but with the flooding, I’m not sure I’ll have a job there in the fall. I wonder if all chefs feel this way.Edit: Oh my gosh thanks for these awards, this started as a post to blow off steam.

I am so checked out. This is my eighth cumulative year teaching, but my first at this school district.Because it is my first year at this school, I have a mentor. Thankfully, there is mentor-mentee confidentiality, so no matter what I tell this person — so long as it isn't threatening to anyone in any way — they cannot reveal anything to admin. I let her know this; I let her know I'm checked out; I let her know I'm looking for other work. From manipulative and gaslighting students to bitchy administration, this job isn't worth the gray hairs popping up in my hair and the heart flutters in my chest at night anticipating the worst the following day.Not only do we need a total overhaul of the bureaucratic gobble-dee-gook, we need to rescind all the emotional bullshit. No, your kid's feelings are not more important than learning the curriculum; no, your kid's feelings are not more important than learning coping mechanisms at home; no, your kid's fucking feelings are not more important than the rest of the fucking class'! I have been investigated behind my back by admin multiple times for students complaining about me or other students, and each time they tell me after the fact that nothing has been found, but that they felt I should know what transpired.

I am a 1st-8th grade  math interventionist who pulls groups between 3-7 math students throughout the day for 30 minute sessions everyday. I also should note that my groups of students are grouped deliberately known as “soarers”- they often are sent out of the classroom for extreme behavior issues or defiance.It was the end of the day and my last group of students (7th graders) were 15 minutes late to my math group bc they were late coming in from recess. I would have less than 15 min left of math instruction with them, and these groups can be difficult to get through a lesson, so I decide to play War (the card game) with them. I play math review games or do problem solving every day, but this is the first time we just sit and play a card game. Of course at that moment, my principal and dean (who NEVER observe me and haven’t all year!) came in and saw me playing with them. Well instead of pulling me aside and being like “hey, I know they were late but even a few minutes of math is better than nothing. We need to prioritize instruction time” or something to that degree, the principal immediately berates me IN FRONT OF the students, and 2 other groups of students and my coworkers! He yells at how we don’t have time for any games, math proficiency is at 6% and I’m wasting their time, talks down to me like a child and tells me to put away the cards now. I put away the card game but my students immediately felt bad (which they never do, lol) and after they both left, said “we didn’t mean to get you in trouble Miss T”. I assured them they didn’t do anything, got my dry erase boards and we did our 3 min left of linear equations, then walking them back to their classrooms, the tears just started streaming down my face and wouldn’t stop. I was embarrassed and mad at how it was handled, and other students/coworkers saw.I had a free 20 minutes before pushing into 1st grade and went to the bathroom to cool off. I overheard one of my coworkers outside the door go, “yeah, I saw her- she looked like she was crying” and the principal scoffs and goes “I raised my voice but I was upset, I didn’t do anything wrong! What does she expect?” and I heard him walk away. This principal is a guy whose reputation precedes him: he never apologizes or takes accountability for how he treats people or what he says to staff (ex. “If you don’t like how things are run, you can let me know but I’m not going to change my mind”, “sorry you feel that way but…”), doesn’t listen to criticism or answer questions that may pertain to how things are run, etc. He isn’t even in the building half the time.I came back from the bathroom after 15 minutes and my math team/coworkers were so nice to me. They asked what’s wrong and I started crying again and said I was just embarrassed and that this isn’t who I am as a teacher, that I do math instruction and I actually had someone come observe me today during 5th grade groups. They told me that the principal confronted me in poor taste, that THEIR own students felt bad for me, and that he is bad at talking to people (staff, the kids, and IPS). I know- it’s not a reflection of who I am as a teacher. I don’t think he understands that I didn’t cry bc he yelled at me or that I don’t care, I cried bc I was embarrassed and I care TOO much. It’s not a reflection of my teaching, and I’m mad that this is the one time they decide to leave their office and walk around the building. I know I should’ve done my linear equations lesson, but it was already hard enough getting the “soarers” to come straight from recess to my math group, and I wouldn’t have much time left. I let them talk me into playing a game instead since we had so little time. I shouldn’t have done it. I just didn’t like how it was handled, it was degrading. My questions are: How do you get past the embarrassment? Or the resentment towards your boss? Did you stay in a place like that for long?UPDATED update: Got back to work this morning, my Dean called a meeting for our team. Really it was her way of apologizing necessarily without an explicit “I’m sorry”. She said that she can’t control the words that come out of people’s mouths, and that the message was right, but the delivery was wrong. She said that she should’ve pulled me aside and talked to me rather than me getting yelled at in front of my students. She talked to him afterwards- and although the Dean feels remorse, he apparently does not as he stated “I still don’t see what I did wrong”. 😆 All is good, it’s closure for me because I was riddled with anxiety this morning. Thank you again to all of the supportive comments (and fuck the one troll comment)- I love my students and I’m happy to have my soarers excited to learn math each day with me!Last update: one of my coworkers on the ELL team got out of an IA meeting… tell me why this principal said, “Scores are down right now. I caught one of my math interventionists playing CARDS with her students. She should be lucky she still has a job right now.” Then she says afterwards, he’s talking with one of his staff members and he mentions me BY NAME. I was willing to let it go after his Dean apologized for him… there is no union at my public charter school, but there is the owner of the school that is his higher up.

Today I received a call from my principal asking why all my students have “100”s in the grade book. Yes, normally I would be concerned if I saw that as well. However! I have brought it up 6 times this year that all of my content, assignments, and attendance have been wiped from Canvas. The longest streak of stability has been 3 days. Each time, I lose everything. My principal asked if I have been exporting the gradebook at the end of each school day, which I have. The problem is that my course (AP Lang) is writing intensive. It takes me a few days to grade each assignment. So I get about half way through grading one assignment before it wipes all the other assignments they’ve submitted in the mean time. Additionally, we are required to leave assignments open until 11:59PM and the courses have been wiping at midnight. That leaves no chance for me to verify who submitted what. Her solution: It’s better to put in what grades you think they deserve then for all of them to have a 100 average.

Every year I've had the mindset that I'll reach a point where I'll get past this and settle into my career, but with this being my third school and the pandemic being handled so badly, I'm starting to think this is just the reality of teaching. I just had my first baby in December. I was very nervous to go on maternity leave because, as we all know, it's so much harder to be out than it is to be in the classroom. I was super organized - I had six weeks of plans for each class written out to the day, all organized in a drive folder, along with tons of worksheets and busy work to supplement, plus scheduled assignments that would post on Google Classroom throughout the leave. I also made physical copies, left stacks on my desk, and labeled everything in my office with little sticky notes so anyone walking in would know what everything is. I shared this with my team and my administrators and the maternity leave sub. I told them not to hesitate to reach out to me if they needed anything. I spent the bulk of my leave not hearing anything from anyone. I reached out but just got messages like ""everything's fine, just focus on having that baby!"". I saw that the kids weren't completing my Google Classroom assignments, but with the constant reminders that ""everything was fine"", I figured they just found something else for the kids to work on. I'm now at the end of my leave, and I'm just now finding out that my administrators are saying that I didn't leave any plans. My coworkers are calling the kids ""feral"". I guess they've been allowed to play basketball and football in my room (I'm not the PE teacher) and they've been doing nothing for the past 2 months.

I was never contacted about any of this. I'm so upset and confused, because there's a paper trail of all of this. I still have the emails where I shared all of my plans and checked in with them.

We've used it a few times for hurricane days, which has been nice since we don't have to make up those days.

A kid who is so lovely, so promising, so fantastic a testament to youth and possibility--a kid who is the pride of their parents. A kid you were proud to have said you taught.  A kid you are now putting in the ground.One of my very favourite people (not just student) was buried yesterday.  He was 21 years old. I had known him since he was 14, just starting grade 9 at a new school.  I have taught for well over a decade, and this (unfortunately) is not the first time I have attended a funeral service for a student.  The very first was my very first year of praticum.  That child was five.  Cancer.  It is awful to think of parents losing their child, and that happens to them once.  For teachers, it can happen over and over during their career*, and what is there for it?  I know in major events there is often grief counselling, but in the every day life of the every day teacher, it seems to be a grief we have to struggle with alone.  And worse, know will probably happen again during our lives as teachers. As I said, this is not the first death of a student I have weathered, but I still don't know what to do with that grief.  The surreality of burying a person so much younger than yourself, and the more horrible surreality of knowing it won't be the last time.  As a teacher, new or veteran, it is an unfortunate truth of your career that not everyone you teach will outlive you.  Some will predecease you by years if not decades, and that is an incredibly harsh reality of the profession we have chosen.  A reality that is never mentioned.  I don't know where I am going with this or what the point of it all is, I mean, I am still in the throes of major grief over this student's death... I guess maybe I just wanted to let young teachers out there know, grim or ghoulish as it might seem, that if you plan to remain in this profession for any length of time, to prepare yourself for this eventuality.  I'm not saying don't get close to people, don't let students touch your heart--of course not!  That is the main joy OF teaching, in my opinion, the chance to get to know and help mold these incredible human beings that you otherwise never would have met.   I always hoped to be a teacher that would have students who wanted to attend MY funeral.  I never considered the reverse. But in the midst of life we are in death, dark as that may seem, and not all of them will make it.  God, that's dark.Enjoy them while you have them--be it four years or eight or twelve. They are your children, too, and it is ok to love them.  And so very, very painful when you lose them.--For Sid, with love.*Please don't take this to mean I think teachers have it harder than parents who have lost a child.  I can't imagine anything worse, honestly.  I know for parents it is far worse.TLDR: Grieving teacher reviews harsh reality of a profession where you meet thousands of wonderful people and lose some along the way.

I wasn't quite sure why he was asking about them, but I didn't mind.Then he went, ""but where are you actually from?"" Oh.

However, today was almost too much.Background: I teach Latin.  I am the only Latin teacher in the district, and I do 8-12.  This means I am at two schools.For the last three years, I have had a combined 2/3 class of students so I could take an ELA class (taught that for 15).  This is the third year in a row with a new ELA prep (American Lit. this year, so I am okay with it).Now, the pandemic has made things interesting.  Rather than being able to use my Latin textbook from last year, which we did not come close to finishing, I am doing things virtual.  My Latin II class this year is using a program that is completely different from what I was doing.  I am scrambling like mad to scaffold, find assignments and make sure the students are successful.However, it gets even more interesting.I live in a rural area.  We are a Title 1 school.  A large number of my students lack home Internet and are being sent home to quarantine.  I have to compile work assignments for students in a class I know nothing about that is 100 percent virtual.  This includes all vocabulary, exercises, grammatical forms and the like.It gets MORE interesting.Parents are deciding to pull their kids out and keep them at home.  Some, fortunately, have Internet.  These I am not overly concerned with.  However, those who are pulled out indefinitely will need a constant stream of work sent home, completed and returned. When a student is pulled out of school, they are changed on my rosters.  In two classes, I have eight, yes, eight, different rosters that seem to change daily.  When a student is put back into school, they go on a roster.  I have to find and manually move grades over.The MOST interesting part of the whole ordeal.I am at two schools.  I have one planning period for travel, lunch and planning.  The drive is not bad >10 minutes. So, in my brief time that I have for planning, I have to:1. Prepare ahead for four preparations;2. Plan for remote learners and in person learners;3. Set up Google meets and times;4. Collect, and grade work for learners without home Internet;5. Keep up with grades from continually shifting rosters;6. Call parents about students with failing grades;7. And all of the other fun documentation that I do!Anyway, I really did not want to vent, but today, along with today being my mother's birthday, whom I lost in May to the virus, was just a bit much.Thanks for reading.

She gave me this idea a month ago, and I did it for the first time this week.We were doing a scavenger hunt on Thursday, and I had one student not doing his work, distracting others, running around the room, and throwing stuff. After I told him multiple times to stop and do his work, I finally walked over to my desk, pulled up his mom’s phone number on my laptop, and called her: “Hi, this is Mr. LavaSlushy calling from (school name) how are you today?…I’m (student name’s) math teacher and we’re in class right now doing a scavenger hunt, and (student name) is throwing stuff across the room, running around, distracting others and not doing his work. I’m having a hard time getting through to him, can you talk to him for me?”Her: Yes sir put him onMe: (student name), phoneAfter they get done talking, I thank her and we hang up. He got his paper and got to work. I did the same phone call for another student who was doing the same thing and I got the same response from the other parent.Friday I had two girls sitting in the back of the room and after multiple chances to stop talking so much and get their work done, I decided to move one of them and she said “No, I’m not moving my seat. I’m staying right here”. I told her if she didn’t move she’d get lunch detention. She said “Okay I’ll have lunch detention”. I walk over to my desk and open my laptop and start typing an email to admin about it. She then says “Are you going to tell my mom too?”. At this point, she’s more concerned about her mom being notified than the actual lunch detention. I call her mom and say “Hi, this is Mr. LavaSlushy calling from (school name) how are you today?…I’m (student name’s) math teacher and we’re in class right now and (student name) is getting too distracted talking to her friend and not getting her work done.

They were protesting against everything, trying to push my buttons in every possible way and one of them (the leader so to say) refused to do what I had instructed him to do. He was also sneering at everything I was saying to demonstrate how little respect he has for me. The last straw was when he started aping something I said in a stern tone.

This is the newest addition to my collection. The book is based on analysis and comparison of 'good' teachers and their techniques and distills those observations into techniques and skills teachers can apply in the classroom. The book touches on Tracking students understanding, lesson planning and the use of questions (and more).  I have found the book to be highly valuable for myself because it focuses on, and is build on actual applications in the classroom, as opposed to some of the other books i read over the years, which focus on some theory and no application to the classroom.2. Cognitive Load theory by Sweller, Ayres and Kalyuga. This is among the very few books about pure theory that i actually referred back to over the years. There are many papers publicly available that do a much better job introducing into the theory than i can do, so i wont go into it here. What i can tell you though is that this book finally presented me with something i was in desperate need for in college: a connection between theory and application. The main value of this book is found in its deep analysis of the way students learn and interact with new topics. Sweller et al did a remarkable job applying their theory to the teaching profession and came up with major implications for the way students interact with instructional content.3. The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Now, im not a physicist. I wont claim to have any idea about physics. Thats also not why i invested into these books (at \~200 bucks a piece, thats quite the investment). Richard Feynman is widely considered as one of the best explainers of the 20 century. As someone who deeply struggled with giving reasonable explanations of new topics to students, i studied his books not for the physics, but for the way he teaches them. His focus on concepts, building prior knowledge before he confronts you with the math, and overall skill to relate ideas in a way thats both easy to follow and also allows you to grasp big connections is something i admire to this day. 4. How i wish i taught math, by Craig Barton. I originally bought this book to help me get better at teaching math in an after school program for high school kids with failing grades. Initial impressions went along the lines of: great, this is another useless book full of generic advice. Well let me tell you that could not have been further from the truth. The book is overall presented as a report. The author has done substantial amounts of research into the field of psychology, and adapted those into his math lessons in school. Each chapter focuses on a different idea, and is structured pretty much the same way: theory first, followed by implications for the classroom, followed by experiences with the theory applied in the class room. Even though the author teaches high school math, its really a book about psychology. And it does a great job bridging the gap between theory and reality.5. Mastery by Robert Greene. Not at all a book about teaching or education. Its one of those esoteric, generic pseudo science books. Its written awfully presumptuous, and has the general: i have found something amazing - attitude about it. But i love it. I love it for the perspective it takes on things. The book is a summary/ an analysis of famous people, that have achieved great things, and tries to generalize principles from this. I love the underlying message: hard work pays off. I regularly do lessons with the book - mostly at the beginning of the school year - where i set expectations for the students. And i made amazing progress by doing so. 6. The subtle Art of not giving a f\*\*k, by Mark Manson. This book was recommended to me when i first went into therapy because i could not handle the amount of stress i was under. It definitely changed my life. I am comfortable to say that, without this book, i would not be where i am today. The book goes through a number of different concepts of dealing with social situations, one of which is to focus on the things you can influence and are responsible for. This single insight alone has helped me tremendously over the last \~3 years, and made me an overall better teacher. 7.  Eddie Woo's Youtube Channel. Along the lines of what i wrote about Richard Feynman, i trouble with explaining things simply. I watched a number of people on youtube explain stuff, none of them (in my mind) did it better than Eddie Woo. To me, hes a prime example of teaching with a positive attitude while also giving rigorous, easy to understand explanations.",teaching1460589738.0,Arrested in front of my class.,"Today was going good.

Every metric in the red on their local dashboard. >10% positivity. At the last school board meeting, they said they were still looking to advance despite community spread because statistically, kids are 'not as likely' to spread/die from the disease. (Never mind that this statistic is heavily skewed by the fact that we closed every school back in March, so the kids have effectively been in quarantine for nine months while the parents are out and about.) WHAT ABOUT THE TEACHERS?? Last I checked, we're adults who are perfectly capable of giving COVID to each other, or to your kids. You can't act like the kids are the only ones going back in the building.

As he put it, the comments by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield about prioritizing school reopening were taken out of context. In context, as he put it, once we've closed bars, movie theaters, and everything else to prevent community spread, *then* we should prioritize school reopening. If we open schools now alongside everything else (this was my favorite part), **school spread will mirror community spread**. That kid is going places.",teaching1632312179.0,"Public school teachers in the US going to organize nationally and strike.

Obviously flexibility is necessary and required in many instances, but flexibility can be an expectation.I was reading a post on r/amitheasshole and it was a professor who went back and forth on being rigid and then flexible and didn't understand why it wasn't yielding positive outcomes.If you have a million rules, you're not doing it right. Kids can't remember 20 things. I have four rules:1) Respect me. Most stuff fits in that and every once in a while, I'll have to explain why something was disrespectful, but most kids understand that.2) Respect your classmates. This spans from taking stuff, being rude, interrupting etc. Easy enough3) Respect the staff, including cafeteria, custodial staff etc. If they know you respect custodians, they don't just sweep or throw trash on the floor. They don't make the bridge in their mind that someone has to clean it up cause their parents pick up after them. You make that bridge for them.4) Respect yourselves. I tell the students they each deserve respect and should demand it from me and others. This is a bit abstract, but I usually go on at the start of the year that I'll respect them, but I need help doing so. If something is going on at home, let me know as much as they can and I can work with them. They're individual humans, not little underlings and they will be treated as humans. This means that they're not just someone's kids and it creates a sense of personal ownership for actions and responsibilities.And it's a sneaky way to let them know I care and love them. If you establish the expectation that you love what you do and want to support their success, they're more likely to embrace that.For other stuff, have clear cut policies and don't make exceptions unless for extraordinary cases. Assignments are due by a certain time, but the moment you start taking one or two late, you'll start having other students expecting them to get away with it. Kids love taking a mile, so make sure they understand what an inch is in your classroom.Good luck to all, and try to make it to Thanksgiving before you start saying ""Fuck this.""",teaching1599238367.0,Remote Teaching,"I am having a rough week, I’m feeling burnt out and tired.

Teachers have the option to teach remotely from their classrooms, with mandatory temperature checks before they enter the building and the expectation that they do not congregate. Phase Two: K-3 comes back Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Wednesdays our building is shut down for mandatory sanitization. Students are required to wear masks and desks are to be at least 3 feet apart.Phase Three: 4-6 comes back into the building. There are two groups: one is in the building Monday and Thursday, the other is Tuesday and Friday. The building is still shut down for sanitization on Wednesdays. Phase Four: For high school. 9-12 comes back hybrid. Phase Five: 100% back in person. This phase is back to “normal” and may not be achieved this year. Some general info for all phases:- We will not start going back in person until cases have been declining for two weeks in a row.- Students will be required to get their temperature checked before entering the building.- Bathrooms will have signs that indicate whether or not they have been sanitized (therein letting teachers know if it’s okay for their class to use or not).- Water fountains will not be running (however my school has hydration stations and students will all be provided with a water bottle).- Breakfasts will be “grab and go”. Students will take one and then eat in their classroom. - Lunches will be passed out, and there will be no “lunch line”. Students will maintain a 6 ft distance sitting at lunch tables and only one grade will be in the lunch room at a time. There was an information overload when we went through this meeting yesterday so this is the generalized version and I am probably missing something, however it makes me feel comforted that our plan is so extensive!!

As most everyone has heard by now, Texas was hit with an insane snow storm that has caused water outages, rolling blackouts due to an energy crisis, and many deaths across the state. The area I live in has had a consistent 6+ inches of snow on the ground for an entire week (which is record breaking in Texas). The roads have been iced over and slushy at best. People in the surrounding area have lost power and/or water in these extreme low temps.Due to this extreme weather, TEA gave everyone 3 free bad weather days so that we could stay home and stay safe. But what did my school do? Made everyone come in at 8:00 for a full day of school on Tuesday morning after Presidents day and drive through the ice and snow. Not even a late start!! So then, when we get news that we're next on the list of possible blackouts to conserve power, the school tells us we'll have a late start on Wednesday and we'll only go home if the power is off for more than an hour. Well that's great! We only have to freeze our butts off for an hour before we get to go home. So the snowmageddon continues, but we never lose power (thankfully, but the weather was still horrible) and administration decides we don't need a late start for Thursday, so come on in at 8:00 again! It's not like the roads are even slushier than before due to the melting and refreezing that's been occurring for the past week!

We could have stayed home and stayed safe Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and NEVER have to make up those days and then showed up on Friday when it was warm and safe!!!

It's also important for grown-ups to play in their own ways too! Here is a quote i especially like from it:“Play is children’s language. They act out pretend scenarios as a way to express concerns, ask questions, and, crucially, reshape a narrative.

I can’t get kicked out cause I have an IEP.”  This kid CONSTANTLY uses his IEP to try and get out of class, to go to the bathroom whenever he wants, to get out of work and to generally cause problems.  His IEP is for ADHD…I’m sorry; but that’s just not a reason for these kinds of rules.  ADD/ADHD is a problem of course (I was diagnosed with ADD back in HS too, but learned coping mechanisms and didn’t use it as an excuse) but to give kids these kinds of excuses is inexcusable.  For this kid alone, I’m supposed to fill out a daily assignment report despite the fact that it’s all posted on Google Classroom and I’m supposed to give him all kinds of additional accommodations and the kid doesn’t even care about his education.  His mom obviously doesn’t either because she has trained him to use the IEP excuse at every turn.   Sorry for the rant, but I believe SPED should be reserved only for kids who actually need it.  An IEP should be a rare thing, not 35% of my class.  And the whole “can’t be kicked out” thing needs to be gone.

And I ask hands up if they know the solution. That is to give recognition to those who solve it in the class. That helps to encourage others to do the same in next day. And after that, I teach them how to solve the problem in step by step. This whole thing may take 5-7 minutes from your class but I am witnessing a big difference from my students.Here are some problems I used in my class. I recommend you to start with this little funny problem.

I love that I get to interact with so many wonderful young minds and develop meaningful student-mentor relationships with them. I love my supportive admin. I love that I get to teach at the AP level.

I teach Culinary Arts at a Title I high school.  Since it can be challenging for my school to fill faculty positions since we serve students from impoverished backgrounds in a rural area, we've had to fill several of our faculty positions with long term subs.One of our special education teachers is a long term sub. This teacher supervises a self-contained special needs class and is assisted by several full time instructional aides.The teacher who was responsible for this class is still at our school ... but due to staffing shortages, building admin assigned her to another position. The program and procedures that she started is still in place. One of the programs that this class is responsible for is running our recycling program.Every week, the students from this class push two wheeled recycling bins down the halls of our school. Classroom teachers leave flattened boxes and blue trash bags filled with cardboard and paper in the hallways for the students to collect. All of these items are collected and stored behind the school for the trash company to collect. Based upon the weight of whatever is collected, the school gets paid roughly $50 per ton. All of the money earned goes back into our building fund.My Culinary Arts classes have benefited from this fund. Since roughly 1/3rd of my students can't afford to pay their $40 annual lab fees, the school has always covered the cost of these students. Without this funding, I'd either have to cut back our kitchen production to just two days a week or I'd have to shut the kitchen down in March after we expended our funds. As it is, the money made from recycling has helped to keep our kitchen open through the end of the school year.  It is partially for this reason that I'm very grateful to the special education class that oversees our recycling program.Ever since this program started 3 years ago, I've noticed that the kids have a good work ethic. They always come by during 5th period to pick whatever we've left outside the Culinary Arts kitchen. They're never loud or fussy. If it wasn't for the trundling sound of the wheels in the hallway, I wouldn't even know that they were there.Last month we had some extra ingredients from the production of ambrosia salad. The advanced students of my 6th period class produced the additional portions pictured below to the give to the special education class as a way of saying thank you for all of their hard work.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/tm0yufbfjvd21.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b121475f3f94ca5dd607894f264831cfecbd09fSince my Culinary II students have been working on the production of *cha-shu bao*, Chinese rolls (steamed or baked) stuffed with BBQ pork, I had 4 student groups produce a sweet roll dough. Although the dough was enough to make 12 rolls, we only needed 8. I therefore took 1/3rd of each group's product and used this dough to create these orange glazed cinnamon rolls for the students who run our recycling program.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/waxh8hrgkvd21.jpg?width=532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acb0d1e86aeef5dbe9a3a02731533593deb58f63The cinnamon rolls were just coming out of the oven when the kids came by. Since I didn't know if this would be a convenient time for the students to have their cinnamon rolls, I asked one of the special ed aides to come into the kitchen. When I showed her these treats and told her that I had wanted the students to have them as my way of saying thank you for all of their hard work, the aide burst into tears.""Nobody ever thanks us,"" she cried.I reminded her that last month we gave her class fruit ambrosia.""But you're the only one,"" she sniffed. ""No one else ever takes notice of our students.""I stepped back because she looked as though she wanted to hug me. Since she knows that I'm autistic, she also knows that I don't like being touched. She took a moment to regain her composure and one of my students actually stepped forward to ask if she needed any help in getting the cinnamon rolls back to her class.She smiled and nodded.When she stepped into the hallway with a full sized sheet pan holding 18 cinnamon rolls, her students gasped.""Are those for us?"" asked one of the kids.""It is!"" smiled the aide.Her students cheered. It was a touching moment. I especially respect the fact that instead of abandoning their recycling bins and racing down the hallway to return to their classroom, the kids carried on with their responsibilities. They didn't even chatter, though their huge smiles spoke volumes to my heart.It was a good day.

When I took this position, I had no idea that corporal punishment was still a thing that was allowed in schools, but I quickly learned that a lot of school districts still use it in their disciplinary model. Last year, it seemed like they were used pretty sparingly, but this year they are using ""swats"" a lot and they are being combined with other types of punishment. I will hear administrators use language like ""I lit them up"" when referring to giving swats (insinuating that they hit certain kids harder) and it's super tacky. I sent a student to the office for bullying another student, and they apparently gave him 3 swats, and then after school he had to run bleachers because he's an athlete. I mean, he needed to be punished for the bullying in some way (this was an ongoing thing) but now I feel like our relationship is ruined because he associates me with this excessive punishment. They always give them the option of ISS over being swatted, but they seem to really try to coerce the students into taking the corporal punishment (you'll miss sooooooo much school & won't be able to play sports, etc.)I really am not looking for advice because I'm planning on leaving this position at the end of the year, just wanted to rant about how ridiculously antiquated and bizarre this whole thing seems.EDIT: I feel SO much more validated in my decision to leave this district since reading all these comments. No joke, I really have felt like I'm somehow in the wrong for being so opposed to my schools use of corporal punishment because as far as I know, the entire staff and admin seem to really believe in it as a behavior deterrent. I mentioned this in a comment, but they *genuinely* believe that kids in other districts must be running around like wild animals because they aren't being physically punished for wrongdoing.For clarification about my bully incident, I had discussed this issue with this students parent and with an AP and it was established that he would spend time in ISS if the behavior continued, which is why I sent him to the office, BUT they gave him the ISS or swats ultimatum.",teaching1580701486.0,"Unpopular(?) opinion: I’m a teacher, not a miracle worker","Just starting my second year of teaching and trying to create a mindset that is more sustainable.

Well I don’t know the sub’s number or email so who do I contact to turn all my late assignments in tonight?” In my school we’re not allowed to reject late work—if it’s from that grading period we have to accept it up to our deadline and many teachers even accept work after and end up doing grade change forms. This is encouraged to the point it’s expected. We’re also not allowed to fail above a certain percentage—if you do, you’ll end up on a growth plan. This of course results in all the students thinking of deadlines as negotiable, test scores being lower because so many kids ignore work until the deadline then attempt to do a term’s worth in one night, thereby retaining nothing, and I fear for how they’ll fare in the real world. So it was very satisfying to reply that I told them before I went on leave that the sub doesn’t get paid to grade after hours, and that they would have to respect  whatever deadline the sub gave them.

If we got into who “deserved” what, it would be a bloodbath, especially since the particular class I have this year cheats as naturally as breathing.

Those assignments go straight to the trash because I’m not taking my time grading it if they didn’t take time to do it.I’m pretty lenient when it comes to grading assignments other than major grades. For homework, I call it Completion+. Since homework is practice, I don’t want to hit a student who is still learning, so if I can tell they made a real effort to answer correctly, they get the points. If it’s one word that has no connection to the topic, is skipped, or is the definition off Google with zero thought to how it would tie into the class (for example, if they were asked to define “bow” and we were learning about the Battle of Agincourt, if they define it as a piece of ribbon tied to the end of a child’s pigtail, it would be wrong) no credit is awarded.This particular parent emailed me Friday after her student emailed me twice earlier that day.

They are mostly for physics because that's what I teach but there are a good number of others in there. They run on any internet-connected device. They are all free and will always be free.**Who are you?**I am a physics teacher in the Chicago Public Schools. For the last 7  years I've been teaching 9th grade physics but in the fall I will be switching to upper classmen. I have also have a minor biology and have taught it a little bit way back when.**Why now?**I've been sitting on these, some of them for years. I've always wanted other people to be able to use them but I've always been to lazy to make it happen. I've played around with the idea of making a start up but with so many kids needing to learn science outside of the lab this year I knew now was the time. I've spent the last few days figuring out how to host a website, buy a domain (What exactly is DNS?

I want to help as many students as possible get a high-quality three-dimensional science education. The apps will always be free.### Virtual Labs/PhenomenaThese replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. [Bug In Meadow](https://whscience.org/buginmeadow/) - **Biology** - Replicates the common Bead Bug activity. click/tap the bugs on a meadow to eat half of them. Click ""count"" to see how many of each color survived and then have them reproduce. After several generations you see strong selection pressure based on the colors in th meadow. This is one of the first I made so it looks janky but it works better than any actual beads and cloth version I've seen. [Mg HCl](https://whscience.org/mghcl/) - **Chemistry** - Simulates HCl reacting with Mg. Shows the molecules and graphs. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers.[Rusting](https://whscience.org/rusting/) - **Chemistry** - Simulates rusting at different temperatures and environments and for different shapes. Shows the molecules. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers. [Temperature Solids](https://whscience.org/temperaturesolids) - **Chemistry** - Simulates the movement of particles in two solids at different temperatures. You can change the size of each solid (number of particles) and starting temperature and you can drag them to touch or not touch. You see a graph of their temperature over time. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers. [Cart and Pulley](https://whscience.org/cartpulley) - **Physics** - Cart attached to a string over a pulley with a weight on the end. It has basic directions on the screen. Also available  [without directions](https://whscience.org/cartpulleynodirections).[Collisions](https://whscience.org/collisions/) - **Physics** - Change masses and initial velocities and measure final velocities.[Electric Car](https://whscience.org/electriccar/) - **Physics** - Is this useful to anyone? I don't know but I might as well put it here - You set the maximum speed of an electric car and watch the battery drain. I used it for my students to practice looking at linear and non linear relationships. It was part of a whole unit on electric cars. [Index of Refraction](https://whscience.org/ior/) - **Physics** - How can you tell the difference between a real diamond and a fake? Use Snell's law of course. Practice on water, glass, and plastic then determine if your diamond sample is real or a fake. In this simulation you drag and rotate a laser, ruler, and protractor. [Roller Coaster Motion](https://whscience.org/rollercoastermotion/) - **Physics** - Change the angle of the slope and initial of a roller coaster. Record and download position, velocities, and acceleration.### Measurement or ProblemsThink of these as virtual practice problems. Students make measurements and calculate or figure something out. [Gel and Restriction Enzymes](https://whscience.org/gelre/) - **Biology** - An old request of my wife's - Two simulations. The first is using restriction enzymes without sticky ends. The second is moving DNA segments a la gel electrophoresis. Keeps track of how many you have done. [Ants](https://whscience.org/ants) - **Physics** - Two ants run across the screen. Students use a ruler and stopwatch (included digitally) to find velocity and acceleration. It's like a physics problem but with a real moving object so all the quantities have meaning. There are many calculations that can be done of varying difficulty.[Motion Yes No](https://whscience.org/motionyn) - **Physics** - One of the hardest things for phsyics students is keeping a clear distinction between velocity and acceleration. This app helps by putting a moving object in front of them and asking, 'is there velocity?"", ""is there acceleration?"", ""is the velocity changing?"", etc. This is very frustrating for the students, but I find it to be very helpful. I have many versions of this asking about different quantities and including the direction. There is even a test version if people find it helpful. Keeps track of number in a row.### Diagram MakersSometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.[Blood Pressure Diagram](https://whscience.org/bpdiagram/) - **Biology** - A request of my wife's - Shows the dial on an analog sphygmomanometer. Can show systolic and diastolic side by side or on the same dial. Use a screenshot to save the image. (Win-PrtScn or Fn-Win-Space on Windows, Shift-Cmd-4 on Mac)[Pedigree Maker](https://whscience.org/pedigree/) - **Biology** - A request of my wife's - Make pedigree diagrams by dragging the pieces around. Double click to select a piece. Use a screenshot to save the image. (Win-PrtScn or Fn-Win-Space on Windows, Shift-Cmd-4 on Mac)[Energy Bars](https://whscience.org/energybars/) - **Physics** - Tiny app to make bar graphs of types of energy. Drag up and down in each bar. Double Tap the label at the top of a bar to remove it from the diagram. By default it shows kinetic (KE), potential (PE), chemical (CE), heat (HE), and total energy (TE). Hit save and it will download the image.**What's next?**I don't know. I have a lot more that I haven't cleaned up yet. If people are using them then I could work on them. I will probably be making a lot of new apps too since CPS is starting all remote in September.

We’re all being threatened to do as we’re told, or we will lose funding? Do we even get paid enough to risk our lives with COVID-19? Will the potential hospital bills, under any insurance plan, be feasible for teachers to pay back if they do get sick? Background:I have a masters degree in educational tech.I make roughly 41,000 a year in MO.I lose approx. 13,800 to taxes every single year.That means I take home about 27,200 as my yearly salary.I am a single person.I had a dog that recently passed, but he was my only dependent.I live with a roommate in a rental apartment. I have to due to my income, yet MO is considered one of the cheapest states to live.I have a second job dog sitting to supplement costs.I donated plasma for over a year until my body could no longer handle it, simply to offset living costs.I am drowning in student loan debt.My story is not unique. Many people have the same issues and concerns surrounding their job as an educator. Many people cannot live on their single income without sacrificing their time and quality of life. And if you have kids? Your income goes to child care. If you have a spouse? Maybe you can stay afloat, but it’s still not easy. Educators should not have to be married to receive a household income above the poverty line, at any age or any level of experience. Educators should not be afraid to have children or get sick for fear that it would bankrupt them. Educators should not have to have roommates into their late 20s and 30s to survive comfortably.Is education even competitive anymore? Is that the problem. People just don’t see it as a valuable necessity? Is it a career sought after by professionals to work for the good of ALL students? I think about this a lot because doctors and lawyers make triple our income, yet we’re supposed to be the foundation of knowledge and skill in this country. We’re supposed to be heroes and leaders, giving up much of our first amendment right and voice on social media to ensure we are strong faces of the community. Education has become the most greed stricken career, which is a harsh reality I wasn’t ready to face. With admin/school boards choosing worse resources over better ones due to price. With teachers spending money out of their already VERY shallow pockets to provide for our students. With red tape and federal funding cuts that debilitate classrooms all over the nation.The MO governor cut 133 million in k-12 ed funding this year alone, DURING the pandemic.

But my oh my I came to resent it. Though I’m perfectly aware of the need to behave professionally at work, as a teacher I felt I was putting on an exhausting acting performance every day. This was particularly draining as an introvert - there was no escape from social interaction! No opportunity for a quiet 30 mins. I didn’t find the content I taught interesting or intellectually stimulating (I primarily taught kids between the ages of 9-11). Behaviour was often frustrating. I never understood the adulation of children - some kids are fantastic, some are nightmares and the majority are fine most of the time (just like adults). I would feel horrendously guilty going on courses and meeting teachers from other schools who were universally passionate about their careers, whilst I sat there, completely apathetic. I would spend the working day clock watching and the Sunday night dread was unbearable. Whenever I read posts from ex-teachers, everyone seems to make it very clear that they ‘LOVED the kids and LOVED teaching, it was everything else’ that drove them to quit - it has become almost a cliché at this point. So did anyone else out there leave (or are thinking of leaving) because they just don’t like the act of teaching itself?  (P.S.

I asked appropriate questions, and despite my experience I sold myself as best as I can.

",teaching1680471668.0,"Working at a boarding school: what it’s like, how to get hired (if it sounds appealing)","I work at a boarding school in Massachusetts. New England has a whole ancient network of schools like this - a bunch of wealthy & college-like prep schools that kind of fly under the radar. They offer a unique working environment that I think more people might be interested in if they knew what it was like. It’s also probably not for most people. I didn’t see too much discussion of boarding schools on this website, and I thought I’d post in case someone does a search. These places are actively trying to become less elitist, so there’s really not any particular background that you need to get a job at one of these places. Some of my coworkers are alumni & have PhDs, others went to community college and had never heard of Exeter before they saw it on Indeed. If anyone is interested I can post a comment with my advice about how you get hired at one of these schools (there's a whole vocabulary & outlook we look for in apps). I can also give a list of the good ones, okay ones, and bad ones. **Pros:** * Free housing. They give you a place to live and pay for all your utilities. This is part of how they get people to run the dorms (also a con; see below). If something breaks, they fix it immediately since they have tradespeople on staff and don’t want to have their property damaged. I heat as much as I want, use as much water as I please, etc. * Much longer breaks than public school; school year is about 150 days. Summer is three months long, winter/spring break are 2 or 2.5 weeks, Thanksgiving is always the full week, and there’s lots of long weekends. This is partly due to the nature of a boarding school; they have to have long breaks to justify the travel kids have to do to get home. * No commute. I wake up and walk to work. I hate driving but also hate cities so this is really nice for me. * Ready to go community (also a con sometimes). I'm friends with some of my coworkers and they live right near me. It's a bit like college in that way. * Free food three meals a day. This is great financially but also just in terms of convenience. It's also super good & healthy food, basically like an above average college dining hall. *  The kids are super smart and interesting. They come from all over the world & have awesome qualifications. The international students especially are delights to work with. If a kid is consistently fucking up, they get expelled. The standards that are maintained mean that all I do in the classroom is teach, and I get to teach at a high level usually. Some of the kids are smarter than I am, honestly. * These schools have really huge financial aid budgets so you're working with promising kids from rough backgrounds. It makes the job more satisfying, you're not just teaching rich kids as outsiders often assume. My school is like 1/3rd scholarship students. *  I get to coach the sports that I love, and they’re played at a high level & given really good resources. The school has slots for athletic recruits, so the teams are pretty advanced at the varsity level and fun to coach (or spectate). A lot of professional athletes have gone through the school that I work at. * I usually only have one prep and my class sizes are small (this term my smallest is 11 kids). Because I work in the dorm and coach, like most faculty here, they reduce my teaching load. So, I teach, but it’s not all I do - therefore, it stays amusing rather than something that becomes a tedious chore (like it was at the public school I started my career at). * Really good benefits. Salary is lower than public schools but I still make 60k a year early career, and you don't need an advanced degree. The salary you make on paper at these places is lower than what you actually make if you pick up the various side gigs that are abundant at complicated institutions like this (e.g., interviewing for admissions, substituting, proctoring SAT, etc). And my cost of living is basically zero.  **Cons:** * You have to be “on” at random times throughout the day. I don’t work basically from 1-4 p.m. right now, but I coach in the evenings and then one night a week (and three weekends a term) I have to supervise the dorm (not in bed til 11 pm). Dorm duty can be fun but the late hours suck. * For the first \~7 years of employment, your free housing is an apartment within a dormitory. So, if you work at one of these places, you have to be comfortable seeing kids at basically all times of day & sometimes at night if something has gone wrong. If you actually like the kids, this isn't usually a drag. They walk your dog for you, they babysit for you, they want to chat, they’re pretty mature and fun to be around. But there is a definite loss of privacy. After >7 years in the dorm they give you an actual freestanding house to live in, though, so it’s not forever. * If you don't like a coworker, you have to live right near them. * Some of the kids are annoying or strange, or their parents are demanding or toxic. And because I see the kids so much, it can be especially upsetting when they fail or have personal issues. The highs are pretty high working here but the lows are also lower; things feel much higher stakes than at the normal public school I taught at. You really worry about the kids' well-being sometimes, even if it's clear that they're better off here than back home with their parents. * Administrative bloat is enormous and annoying. Way too many meetings and stupid office politics type stuff. These places aren't necessarily run by geniuses. I could write more but that's the gist while I procrastinate grading.",teaching1660772862.0,Mildly infuriating,"Renewing my license- $85 processing fee, $10 renewal background fee, $3 convenience fee(wtf?)

Ms. Smith was my science teacher, but I don't remember learning a whole lot of science. She sat at her desk the entire time, and sometimes wouldn't seem to notice students sneaking out of the door. Everyone was cheating off everyone (including me who had never cheated before in her life), but it was mostly because no one knew what was going on. I remembered one day I asked a question about the work, and she snapped something like, ""I can't believe you don't get this,"" so I never asked her anything again. I used to dread going to that class because it was utter chaos. When I think about the type of class I DON'T WANT, that's the one I think of. Looking back on it, adult me suspects she may have been drinking as her behavior seem to mirror someone who was hung over or just depressed. Who knows what was going on in her personal life?Ms. Smith had a son in my grade, and he was this very handsome athlete that almost every girl had a crush on. I barely spoke to him because I was a total nerd, so I didn't really know him.  After his senior year, he passed away that summer at a party probably doing dumb things that kids do. It makes me really sad to think how awful that must have been for Ms. Smith to go through the worst thing a parent could go through. My heart really goes out to that woman because no one should have to bury their children. So, I went back to my hometown last summer and talked to someone 6 years my junior who had also Ms. Smith. Apparently, she changed. This person told me about all the stuff they did in class and how she was very attentive and it was almost like we were talking about a different teacher---and I guess that's because we were. She had changed. This is going to my 8th year and some years have been better than others, and I'm not the same teacher or person I was 5 years ago. I know I'm not the best teacher in the world as I have made MANY mistakes. But, the best part about teaching is----Every year is a new opportunity. We are not chained to former versions of ourselves, especially if they are not our best version. Every year we have the opportunity to be someone's ""best teacher"" and make a positive impact on a child's life. Ms. Smith is still teaching and thriving today.",teaching1607063114.0,"“Dude chill out,” “that’s rad” and other things I say to 12 years olds","Hi.

I’m finishing up my masters in ED this semester and technically this first year teaching is also my students teaching year.

My colleagues are generally very difficult too.I want to put in my notice tomorrow.",teaching1657659686.0,Social Services are getting involved.,"Update: the day I made this post, I packed all of his art projects in a box with a written message on it. Ever since the call was made, he never came back. So the box is currently sitting in the meeting room :/ I bought a large bag of mandarins as a little something to show everyone I cared for our efforts, and every single person devoured that bag. Thanks to me we have a small breakfast at the end of the week before the kids come in. I'm an art teacher (27F) at a summer camp. I've been teaching at this camp for 2 years. But my boss has known me for 4. During the 2021-2022 school year I started my first year as an elementary Art teacher in an urban suburban area an hour  north from the camp. There were kids with behavioral issues, but for the most part, I encouraged a lot of art therapy for my students, which helped them flourish in class, while learning to respect my boundaries. Overall, it was a pleasurable first year with some moments I wish I did better. Back to camp, we've had this 6 year old boy since the beginning, and at least 2 to 3 reports a week are written up because of his behavior. Today the director, assistant director, instructors (including myself), and counselors had a meeting to help him succeed in camp. He's a kinesthetic physical learner, he likes humor, likes to experiment, and he likes being promised rewards when completing projects/participating. We put it to practice later after camp, and switched some counselors around to use as motivation to participate, and the results?  Bomb and gun threats to counselors, raging and screaming, swearing, talking about his toxic home life to one of the instructors, almost breaking a counselor's finger, and tackling another one, because he didn't want to participate in a session. He had a total of 9 reports written up today. All while this was happening, my boss's boss called social services due to the toxic home life we've been told and advised by him and one of his family members. It's likely he's not coming back tomorrow. It sucks. It really sucks. I feel really bad for him. There's so much we could have done to make him feel welcome and safe. But we did all we could. We're a summer camp, not a public school. I wrote a note hoping to see his artwork in the future, cause despite the behavioral issues, he's a really smart kid.",teaching1644221454.0,Also FYI shout out to elementary school teachers your freaking saints.,"I always dread when I have to sub elementary, because I feel like I'm going to be their father for the next 8 hours. And I try to keep up with a lesson plan. The kids are so endearing because you have them for 8 hours and you get concerned about them. Can only imagine how that feeling is amplified if you have them for a full year. Every time I leave an elementary school I feel like a weight taken off of it and you've gonna do that every day.  Also complete aside from my experience with elementary, they always are really worried about their teacher and why she isn't there.  Warm my heart. We're in high school I'm just a glorified babysitter and making sure these guys don't kill each other.",teaching1671555703.0,Why are the absolute worst parents always also teachers?,"I'm a teacher and I have two school-aged kids. And in my 21 years teaching so far--the absolute worst, biggest pain in the ass and argumentative parents have been other teachers. How is that possible? I am so easy going with the teachers of my own children. I don't understand what goes through people's heads? I'm wondering if that's true for most people as well.",teaching1613250085.0,"We need more cute, educational videos to drown out the useless banal garbage our kids watch","As a parent, I am so frustrated by the useless garbage my children will park themselves in front of. They are getting too old for the educational kiddie stuff and now I have to contend with puberty-focused shows that are too old for my children, or just let them watch mindless videos of animals doing silly things.  Which are kinda funny and entertaining, but there is a void for things on their mental level (grade school).  I tried to get my children to actively participate in solving this problem. I told them they might be famous YouTubers one day if they did it, so they agreed. For me it was just good for them to being doing something of variety during quarantine.   We used their pet parakeet budgies to make videos that combined the ""cute animals"" concept with ""educational"".  The birds are Professor and Student, and they go through trying to teach different things. So far as the pilot, we've only touched on basic math. It takes a lot of work to make these videos and to keep the kids engaged. I have them doing all the voices and even doing the recording of the scenes.But, they're losing momentum. In the beginning they were excited because we sent it off to a bunch of teachers in the local school systems, but apparently that is ""spam"".  So I am turning to our community here.FIRST off -- I'm sharing so that teachers can perhaps use this as entertaining brain breaks for the students. I've seen what my kids get assigned during virtual learning. I've also seen what they watch at home. The idea is to just give them something educational and entertaining at the same time.SECOND -- I want our community to subscribe to the channel so I can motivate the kids to do more videos. Once the subscriber numbers start climbing, I'll pitch to them how their fans want more good content and it is their responsibility to produce quality videos to help other kids. &#x200B;* ""Budgie Brains"" Channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6PETDWIxJeRmdx1QSiN9Vw?sub\_confirmation=1](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6PETDWIxJeRmdx1QSiN9Vw?sub_confirmation=1)* The Trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07DFDSPoyOs&ab\_channel=BudgieBrains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07DFDSPoyOs&ab_channel=BudgieBrains)* First math lesson, teaching adding to 10 facts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REPLljVoh7A&t=5s&ab\_channel=BudgieBrains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REPLljVoh7A&t=5s&ab_channel=BudgieBrains)* Virtual Learning tips, back when we first started: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6v15B7n6w0&ab\_channel=BudgieBrains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6v15B7n6w0&ab_channel=BudgieBrains)&#x200B;So I hope this helps others, but of course I hope it helps us too. It is self-promotion, but I am under no delusions that the kids are going to become internet sensations by recording videos of their birds. I just like the idea of the ethic it teaches the kids and showing them amount of work involved in any venture. I am teaching them about video editing as well. I want them to stay as far away from the snapchat, instagram, tiktok ""selfies"" -- producing a good quality video without shamelessly promoting oneself. That said, before I get flamed, people have sent me some really good/beneficial/educational videos from tiktok, so I understand it is not all bad. We just have to work in the general sense and do our best to equip these young ones.",teaching1612389402.0,Indoctrination,"Im a little confused. As far as I know teachers just teach an academic curriculum. I have kids of my own and I have never seen one of my kids been taught any sort of indoctrination or some sort of cult or political philosophy. I try to talking to my own children quite often and share with them about the importance of thinking by themselves and making their own judgment in things based on reason and accurate information. As they grow I think I allow them to create their own judgement. Now, you will start wondering why Im telling you all this..This is like the 3rd time I have been told that teachers indoctrinate children...Came across a Facebook post and all of the sudden see people making really harsh comments about indoctrination and all kinds of weird stuff..I teach myself and I still havent seen anything like this yet...Does what we teach vary by State..I thought that most states use common core or similar standards to teach...Im new in this profession so Im kind of confuse...Can someone please tell me...I wanna know..",teaching
