1697476758.0,Most absurd thing a parent has complained about?,"I was just thinking about this so I'll go first.

My first year teaching in a private school, I didn't get to make the supply list because it went out before school got out the previous year.

Around December, I sent a note to parents saying that their kids needed a notebook for writing class and mentioned that they had them at the dollar store. Any notebook would do, just something for their rough drafts.

One of the parents (who was a millionaire several times over, they owned a herd of horses that they bred and sold), wrote back asking if this notebook was ""in addition to the school supplies we already paid for?""

She ended up refusing to purchase one and I got one for the kid at the dollar store just so she would have something to use in class. The parent then bitched to anyone who would listen about how I ""demanded"" school supplies mid-year.

I hope she got a hobby or something and stopped hanging around the school just to complain.",teaching
1697557648.0,How do you differentiate for students that can’t read or write?,"For context, I’m a 5th grade ELA teacher. I have a handful of students who cannot read or write, past a kindergarten level. It discourages them and makes it hard for them to follow along with the lesson. some of them have IEPs and get pulled out, but some have never been evaluated. What strategies or accommodations can i use to help them out? i follow what’s listed on their paperwork, they just still struggle.

1697567820.0,How to ask a teacher if I can observe their classroom (as a pre-service teacher) ?,"Hi yall !! I'm in a 5 year BEd program where we do 5 days of in-class observation each year. They differ from proper practicums in that we don't actually teach the classes/grade assignments/etc in observation, we literally just observe (and ask questions after class). I'm new to the city I'm studying in so I don't have any connections to schools/teachers here. I was wondering if it's okay to email a high school and/or teacher's email as posted on the school site. Here's what I was thinking of including: 

* Basic intro of my name, the First Nation I'm from (my teacher program is only for Indigenous people), and my educational background (where I study rn, the 5 day observation aka not a practicum, & a mention of my experience in alternative education as a teenager)
* How I found their email so they're not weirded out
* Request to talk about their experience as a teacher (I like getting to know someone's philosophical ideas towards education) as I'm interested in observing their class for 5 days 
* If the teacher happens to also be a librarian or I'm emailing an alternative school directly, I think I should offer a resume since I work at two libraries (both specialize in different topics relevant to teaching)

For reference I'm becoming a high school (grades 8-12) history and social studies teacher in Vancouver! Ideally working for a public or alternative school, with a preference for Indigenous schools",teaching
1697488813.0,My TA is constantly being taken to support other children when I have a difficult class.,"I guess I just want to see what other schools are like. We recently got trained in RPI because behaviour is just so bad in our school. I have several really difficult children in my class due to behaviour of their own and being violent or some medical needs and yet my TA because they are young and fit is always being requested to cover other classes or supervise difficult children. They're not the only young and fit TA but we are limited in staff that can comfortably restrain. It just feels like it's not working and I don't know if I have any right to ask it to stop.
My TA is barely in our class and they're pulled here there and else where at a seconds notice and then other staff moan interventions aren't being done. I appreciate them so much and it feels like no one else does! We are not a behavioural school and results will suffer but so will kids who aren't acting up and it's ridiculously unfair.
I know they're struggling and are unhappy but if they leave will other schools be the same?
For example at what point do you exclude or suspend a child, staff are hurt regularly and threatened VIRs are filled out and posted on CPOMs and yet still come in the next day like nothing has  happened with no consequences. And I mean no consequences, not even unseen ones theres definitely none.

Sorry for the rant but I'm losing my mind at the moment.",teaching
1697502091.0,Dropped out of college trying to be a teacher,"TLDR:Dropped out but plan to return eventually. Even tho that’s years away. I’m trying to remain hopeful.

This is gonna be a long one. 

I’m 18 and 8 weeks into my first semester of community college I dropped out. I’m sort of at a loss since I’ve known I’ve wanted to be a teacher since I was 9. I got really serious about it when I was 13, and after a traumatic senior year. I was lucky to even have graduated. So I apply to community college. I get in since they take everyone. Major in education with the goal of getting an associates degree in teaching then transferring to a 4 year to get my bachelors in history. Work as a teacher for 10-20 years. Then go back to school to get my masters in school administration and become a principal for another 10-20 years before I retire.

I’ve spent my whole adolescence carefully thinking about this career path. Lurking this sub since I was 14, constantly talking to teachers at my school about their experiences and thoughts on the matter. Even going into the teaching assistant program my junior year in which I helped out at my districts elementary schools.

Frankly most teachers have tried to urge me to stay away from this profession. And it hurts. To see adults I look up to. To have them actively discourage me from what is basically my dream. It hurts. But I understand their reasons.

But the community college I’m at frankly sucks. There’s a reason my older sister hated it. There’s a reason my older brother avoided it. There’s a reason most kids I graduated with also avoided it. Because even for community colleges it sucks. The professors are subpar and Faculty isn’t helpful at all. I kept telling myself I would just finish this semester and see how it goes but I can’t anymore. So I dropped out.

Before everything went to crap my senior year. I had a 3.4 gpa and was 83 of my 246 student class. But by graduation I had a 2.9 and was 152 of my class. My mom gave me an ultimatum near the end of the school year. Either she’d buy me a car. But I’d have to go to community college and stay here at home. Or she’d pay my tuition for a 4 year university. But she would not buy me a car. Deciding I wanted the car I decided to go to community college. But once I started class my mom admitted to me that she had no intentions of buying me a car. And that she just wanted me to stay at home. Upset I continue to go to but eventually I no longer could. I’ve grown distaste for that school and I know I deserve better. I by no means deserve to go to some big fancy Ivy League school. But I just know I deserve better than that sad excuse of a community college. It’s just such a disconnect. My mom owns a successful business and employs multiple people.
She pays for my older brothers tuition and he went to a 4 year as soon as he graduated high school. Now she’s starting to pay my sisters tuition since she made a big deal about paying for her tuition for the last 2 years. And we are Latino. She’s told me my whole childhood and upbringing how everything she does. It’s to ensure we have a better life than the one she had growing up in her home country. So her not really financially supporting me does hurt. But that’s her choice and I can’t get mad what she chooses to do with her money. Regardless she’s made it clear to me that she has no intention of financially supporting me. 

So if I want to go to college and become a teacher. It’s on me to save up money myself to do it myself. Because it’s clear my mom  isn’t going to help me achieve my dream. So for now. My goal is to save up to buy my own car. Then save up to go to a 4 year. Even doing some basic Math tho. From dropping out to attending classes again at a 4 year. This is easily going to take me 4-5 years to do. I’m already working at a restaurant and currently trying to secure more shifts for myself.  

I just know I’m coming back. Even if it takes more than 4 to 5 years. I know I want to continue my education. As a child of an immigrant I have seen and understood just how important and valuable education is. And I know I want to be apart of that.
While I might keep lurking this sub. I don’t think I’ll look at it as much as I used to. Because for now I just need to focus on goals in life. And that goal is to become a teacher.",teaching

If I can get the sub I want, she's not really capable as far as instruction since she's not a certified teacher nor an ELA teacher, but I think she's going to do well with discipline, not that my kids really need it.

So my question is, should I just leave my lesson plans as they are? We have such short classes, I am locked in with lessons, no wiggle room at all. So it's not going to easy to just have a ""busy work"" day when she's there. I kind of need them to stay on target in the plans so we don't fall behind or have to cut even more content.

So, how do you typically address sub days? This is my 6th year but I normally don't ever really take time off. The only substantial time I had to was maternity leave and of course they had to stay on target for lessons since it was an extended time period.",teaching

1697477286.0,Can I raise the pay,"I am a 3rd year uni student and the living wages and tuitions have significantly increased over the last few years.
I do private tutoring for (international) kids 6-13. They bring the materials so I just have to make them enjoy learning. The focus is on reading writing and speaking skills. 

I get paid 25/hr (one class per week). However, there is this one girl in 6th grade (12yr) and she's overly energetic. She has a very weird sense of humor, (sometimes) uncontrollable rude attitude, and a lack of enthusiasm towards learning. So at first, her mom was like ""none of the tutors could last 2 weeks"" and was pretty hopeless. Nobody could deal with her.

However, I ended up teaching her for over 2 months and the mom told me that it's the first time that it has happened and that she absolutely loves learning with me. (I learned how to respond to her and keep her entertained and it's actually a lot of work and effort...ㅠㅠ) Even tho she tries to listen to me now during class, I feel like her energy is getting out of hand and requires a lot of patience and understanding. It honestly drains me after each session but I don't show it.

1697154393.0,Leveling,"It’s my birthday and today I got leveled. I’m still at my still building, just in a different position. I’m fine but I’m not great. I love my job, I love my students. I’m a learning support special Ed teacher and I love teaching, co teaching, writing IEP’s, building connections with families, and I’m good at my job. I’ve worked really, really hard to BE good at my job. I’m stepping into a role that is SO much less work, and everyone is telling me I should be grateful to get a break, but I’m not. I trained for and applied for and worked for the last four years doing a specific job that I wanted, because I was able to make an actual positive impact in it. 

There’s all kind of other layers to why I’m upset about this, but there’s enough identifying details already and also, I’m tired. 

Anyways, I’m going to use this extra time to go to grad school. Either tell me about your experiences with leveling OR tell me your favorite online accredited grad school program! I love special Ed but I’m open to other things too. Maybe counseling? Do counselors get leveled?

ETA: leveling is a terrible process wherein teachers are hired to one school building based on the number of students, and then that enrollment number drops and the newest teachers in the relative department are moved out of that school or department. I’m in a union state and in a HUGE district and leveling in my district means I would have to pick from a list of schools in the district with positions opened, those schools would interview me and whatever other leveled teachers applied, and then pick their favorite. However, and this part is complicated and may not be true for other districts, if someone who had more seniority in the district picked the same school/position, they would get first dibs. So leveled teachers often end up in the worst schools. Now the other piece that is specific to me is that I’ve been doing special education in my current building for four years, and have been in my position longer than all but two other special ed teachers in my building. However, all the other special education teachers in my building were clsssroom teachers who switched recently to special Ed, which means I still have the least building seniority. Even more details, our special Ed numbers didn’t drop. What dropped was the funding for another related program at our school, one that a special ed teacher with more seniority than me ran. So even though I had the largest caseload in our building, I’m the one who got pushed out. I didn’t want to pick another building with a special ed opening because I could have lost out on it if someone with more district seniority than myself picked it and end up totally screwed. “The devil you know” situation. 

I love my colleagues and my students so much, I am lucky to be in one of the better buildings in my district. And I really want to stay in my district, not because it’s a great place to work, but because they need good teachers and the students deserve people that will work hard for them. It’s just really unfair and really dumb that I have colleagues who hate the work that goes along with special Ed and don’t do it, and complain about it, and think I’m lucky to not be doing it, but I’m the one who gets pushed out.

1697035629.0,I want to quit… or transfer?,"Hi all - this is kind of a vent, I guess… I’m a second year teacher and I am absolutely miserable. 

Last year I was a leave replacement at an elementary school and I enjoyed it. Now, I teach art as a split position (high school in the am and the kindergarten in the afternoon - same district as the leave btw) and I am absolutely exhausted and just so unhappy with this placement.

I feel like there wasn’t enough transparency about the position and people waited until after the school year started to talk about how this position shouldn’t exist because the transition in a day is difficult.

I always thought I would enjoy high school, and it’s okay, but I’m not excited to show up and I definitely am not kindergarten only material so by the time I have to leave the HS to go to the kindergarten school, I’m literally thinking of excuses to come up with so I don’t have to go (never do, I always show up). The kindergarten school is also mostly self-contained classes or special education, few gen ed/dual language, and I am not certified or prepared for that. The teachers and aids in those classes definitely don’t like when I go to their class for art (I’m art on a cart for kinder, too!! Yay!!)

I’ve also taken on a lot of responsibilities for after school programs because I didn’t feel like I could say no to (not tenured) and I’m also getting my masters, so shit sucks right now.

I also don’t feel like there is anyone I can trust or turn to in either school to vent to and ask for guidance or support. I tried with one teacher a couple weeks ago and they were basically like “stick it out a couple years and maybe something else will open up” — I don’t even think I can make it through the year!! 

All I want to do is cry.

I’m strongly considering looking for another position that is central to ONE school location and probably elementary (K-4/5) for an assortment of grades vs just one and leave in the middle of the year or next year.

While this is a venting post, I welcome any advice on how to chill the F out and power through or idk

1696944325.0,Would you tell a parent if their kid started hanging with the wrong crowd?,"There's a student of mine who I taught last year in the 9th grade, that I've just heard an upsetting update on.
He's one of the popular kids, but is extremely polite, kind, and does well in class. He had a best friend who was a trouble maker, but in an innocent, rowdy, kind of way.

This year they're in 10th grade and I haven't seen them in a while. I run into the trouble maker best friend and we're chatting and he tells me the polite kid has now become close friends with a bad influence who he implied was getting them both involved in bad things.
Troublemaker was smart enough to duck out, but polite kid is apparently well on the way to get hooked.

This was all implied, never stated outright, and all happens outside of school grounds, never a hint of whatever activities they're up to enters school. So I have nothing to report.

But I wonder if I should talk to polite kid's parents and drop a hint about the friends their son is making? Or is it none of my business since it's outside school and I don't have any confirmed reports?

ETA: bad influence is also a student in my school.

Edit 2: Lots of interesting and conflicting advice here! I don't teach the kid anymore, but I have a good relationship with him. I'm not sure if he'd be a 100% honest with me if I were to talk to him, but he would definitely hear me out.
Now the only information I have is what the best friend told me. I have no reason to think it's fake information, but he didn't give me details on what the kid is hooked on, other than that his eyes are sometimes red in the morning. Wouldn't a parent notice signs like that?
I have no relationship with the parents at all. Never met them, never spoke to them.

I think I'm gonna take the middle ground here and try talking to the boy first, and then go to the guidance counselor. The boy is in a different building than me with a different counselor, so they could definitely monitor him better than I could. If things get really bad, I'll report the incident through our child safeguarding protocol and wait for further instructions.

1696985975.0,Using Masters Degree to Possibly Help Pivot out of Teaching,"Hey all,

I am asking a more futuristic question and I know advice may be difficult to give for this, but I figured I might as well ask. I am a new teacher (third year) and I still do enjoy it for the most part. Good days, bad days, like the social aspect of it, can get annoyed with the admin stuff of it etc... but I am wary of burnout and how it eventually could lead to me hating my job and I want to be prepared for that. 

Which brings me to the masters degree. I have been able to save some money and am looking to do my masters soon-ish. As a Canadian teacher, it comes with a nice pay bump which will help me regardless. Unfortunately, my undergraduate degree is in Kinesiology, so I have some Bio, but mostly teaching and Kines classes, which limits my flexibility on the degree.

My question is, does anyone have any advice or any thoughts on masters degrees that could 1) help with the pay bump (that is most AFAIK) and 2) would allow to pivot out of teaching if ever started not liking it without a crazy amount of undergrad requisites (I'm open to taking some classes to get to a level, but not a huge amount)  

I was leaning towards psychology (I do have a few classes in it and it is a field I enjoy) and doing the masters online so I could still work (at least part-time) but would love to hear some thoughts from some other people.

1696904805.0,Considering moving to the old-school desks in rows layout for my 4th and 5th graders. Opinions?,"I teach 4th and 5th grades. My classroom layout has some issues. It's a pretty small room and about twice as wide as it is long. The chalkboard resides on one of the short walls, and I have a ""smart board"" (oversized computer monitor) on wheels. Currently, I have the smart board on one of the long walls, and I use both the smart board and the chalkboard for most of my lessons. Desks are in groups of 3-4, and students turn to face whichever wall has the board that's currently in use.

Here are the problems:

1) There are some visibility issues with having the smart board on the long wall. Students who are situated close to the board but off to the sides have a hard time seeing the display.

2) The school has a big fighting problem (physical and verbal) as well as some bullying issues. Many of my students genuinely hate each other. It is very difficult to put together teams of 3-4 students in which no one will fight. Also, some students have been using the connecting desks as channels by which to covertly pass gossipy notes, which I am trying to put a stop to.

3) I have some minor hearing problems that make it difficult to pinpoint where sounds are coming from. When students are sitting super close together, it's not always possible for me to discern who is saying what, which makes informal assessment difficult and also makes it hard to intervene when a student is saying mean things or trying to provoke a peer. 

I was thinking that moving the smart board to be on the same wall as the chalkboard and having desks situated individually in staggered rows facing that wall would solve these problems. I am concerned though because I've been told in many ed courses and PDs that we should not arrange desks for elementary students in such an isolated way. 

Should I move the desks into rows, or not? Thanks in advance for any insights.",teaching

Oh, we're only on page 9, too. I'm literally having a self-therapy sessions as I write this.

I have decided to printout a giant (differnt) packet on ""Night"" and put it on themselves to read and complete.

I will provide a link to the audiobook for those struggling readers to utilize. Today is a free day as I write this to you and as I clean up that work packet for next week. We're going to start the book all over again.

I am going to divide my classroom into two. One one side, the desks are facing my desk. The other side, the desks are facing the other way. Instead of addressing or instructing to all students, I'm going to just instruct to those who *want* to be instructed, so those students will be sitting with me. They are going to be allowed to float from one area to the next so that they are allowed to choose to work independently, or work with me, or not even work if they choose to.

Although we are in Standards Based Grading, luckily, we only work with 3 General standards that are repeating every Unit - Reading, Writing, and Language - so I can actually still evaluate them on all three standards through the packet. The entire packet is worth 100 points, and the percentages will be broken down to the following-      81%-100%, students earn a ""4;""    61%-80%, students earn a ""3;""     41%-60%, students earn a ""2,""     21%-40%, students earn a ""1.""

I know that's not the norm for many areas. That is 3x what I currently make. (They do not want to up the budget for subs from what I heard.)

$58k is actually more than I was making entry level in tech. Tech paid $42k entry level. Not everyone in tech is making $100k right out of college. I understand teachers have to grade, make lesson plans, attend meetings etc. From my pay grade that's definitely worth it. Obtaining a teaching license would cost me around a $2k. I'm also seriously considering going back to school for an MBA then apply to teach at a community college.

I'm not sure how much longer I can keep subbing, because I'm not required to work every day. I have a couple interviews coming up in the next week or so that will pay about $60k. I'm 26 with a degree. I need to start making a livable wage and start paying my student loans back. I also feel that my district would benefit from taking subs like me and put us into a program that would give us a clear pathway to becoming a regular teacher.

1696532969.0,Ideas about ADHD-friendly way to organize info online for teaching history,"Hello, my question is probably about theory of teaching but I think it's important. I myself am a historian, and I worked a bit as a volunteer for ADHD kids but now I started to wonder - if for example there is a website for self-studying history, how can it be organized to suit people with ADHD to make it easier for them to actually learn from it?

Nowadays it's a big problem that teaching history, even to peopel who have no desire to become professional historians, includes lots of long texts and even books; which is great of course, I love history books but I know that for many peopel with ADHD it's a torture to have some 30-pages article on a particular subject, especially if it's not among their top interests (and sometimes it's hard even if it is the interest).

Youtube videos are nice but they are hardly a solution, I see thim as merely an addition.

So, question is - how can history-related visual and text information be organized online to make the process of studying history through it easy and intereting for persons with ADHD?",teaching

1696464063.0,"New school, unsure of dress code","I’m in my 6th year teaching and I just joined a new school on August. The teacher handbook is pretty clear, IMO, that teachers are to dress professionally even if it doesn’t assign it a name like “business casual” or whatever. 

At my last and current schools, I tend to go for that business casual. Black, khaki, or grey slacks, nicer quality blouses and cardigans, and I’m pretty conservative when it comes to dresses and skirts. I have some black Skechers dress loafers and an array of sandals and flats. It’s just what I’m comfortable in. Also, my students are required to wear uniforms so I kind of feel like I should also be “in uniform” or at least on the nicer end of clothing. 

But this school is so unpredictable. I can say for a fact, 100%, I am the only one who dresses like I do. There’s one other teacher who wears slacks and looser blouses so she gets close but no one else, including admin. I see sneakers, like ratty ones, jeans, flip flops, band T-shirt’s, halfway untucked shirts on men, etc. Now, if the school allows that, which apparently they do, then whatever. I don’t agree with it but that’s their decision. I just wish admin would a) be a bit more professional themselves and b) make the dress code more clear. 

But herein lies an issue for me personally. Jeans days. They announce them randomly and never in the same for of communication. I never really know when it is truly a jeans day. Every Friday at my last school was a jeans day as long as you wore your staff shirt. Here? Who knows! Some days people wear jeans when we aren’t supposed to and then there are actual jeans days, I guess. We were just given a staff shirt the other day. Are we expected to wear that on jeans day or not?

I find myself missing out on potentially comfy days  due to the lack of communication and expectations. I just always wear my usual dress wear bc I’m not clear and don’t want to get in trouble for dressing down, esp as the new teacher.

We are able to do this for the district quarterly assessment and for unit assessments, but on the state test most of them will not have this accommodation; only a select few who have IEPs will be allowed to have the state standardized test read to them.

We have a kid 16M that clearly wants to connect with the other kids.  His family are refugees who have only been in this country under a year. He almost exclusively speaks an obscure language.  We have a resource hour for ELL students but the teacher and aid only speak English and spanish.  Google translate does not even do well for this language.


Few weeks in we talked about hobbies and he raised his hand to say he really liked cricket.  The first and one of a few things I have heard from him.  The class is athlete heavy and not particularly interested in what I am teaching so I thought ‘lets go’. Here is a chance for him to share something with the class. Through email he was very on board.


This brings us to tomorrow.  I bought a nerf cricket set and have a translator calling in for ½ hour.  I've got 25 good natured kids who will do well with this.  But now I am freaking out a bit because I am not sure how to structure this hour.

1696097463.0,I gotta hand it to the fifth grade teacher,"I’m the school’s kindergarten teacher, and sometimes the fifth grade teacher gets on my nerves. She has been at the school the longest, and will take random ass recesses just because. She’ll turn her giant kids loose on the playground during my class’s playground time because she wants to stand in her door and eat a cup of yogurt. But, I digress. 

I’ve been stressed to the max because of two violent kids in my class.  My mind was blown that two kids with psychopathic behavior can come in, day after day, and traumatize the 18 “normal” kids who might otherwise enjoy school if it weren’t for the traumatizing shit they’re exposed to daily.  I looked up the laws, and in Arizona you can suspend then expel kindergartners.  What’s the problem? Obviously nothing other than enrollment and attendance are linked to funding.

Anyway, I vented to the fifth grade teacher, which I never do, and she said, “Just send dry, matter-of-fact, emotionless reports to the principal and parents daily.  Eventually the families will have an outburst on you, and leave voluntarily.”

And holy shit, it worked! After one month, the little boy who I was having to restrain from assaulting others every day was gone.  His mom and therapist called the cops on me for a bruise (that looked more like a bite mark) on his arm.  Nothing came of that nonsense.  And a month later, the little girl who would scream at the top of her lungs while slamming the bathroom door (like Ace Ventura at the crime scene) was gone.  Her mom flippantly told me on the way out,  “A male teacher was never going to succeed with her.” Ha! Then enjoy your female teacher.  I have no problem with both families blaming me to save face. 

Now, the fifth grade teacher did warn me that these families will try to return after Christmas. She says, in her experience, the new school reports the same issues and the process repeats itself.  I also feel a tiny bit of guilt that there are other innocent kindergartners about to see some wild shit go down in their classrooms.

Hello, please excuse my lack of knowledge, as this is my first time being an assistant teacher. 

I am an assistant teacher at a title 1 school. I can DM with more details.

My class has at least five “key children,” aka children who should have IEP’s but don’t. We do not have paraprofessionals or rbt’s for them. We were told last week that a sped classroom would start, but I have had no word about it from leadership/admin. The day that the sped classroom was supposed to start, we were told that the one kid in our class who was supposed to go, would not be going because he doesn’t have an IEP. 

I am burnt out. I act as an untrained RBT all day. I barely get to work with my class, in the classroom, because I am constantly trying to coax one aggressive child to come back into the classroom. It’s pissing my lead off, and I have had no support from leadership. Leadership only steps in (if they’re available-other classes have key children too) when a child becomes aggressive or destructive.  They take the Nautilis approach, which probably works for a lot of children, but our key children can move from level one to level six immediately. That means that suddenly a chair is being thrown at me, I am being kicked, hit, or spit at on a whim.  

When I am in the classroom, I am getting the brunt end and having to work with the other children who need a lot of help.  I might be fine with that if I wasn’t constantly out of the classroom otherwise.

I know I am in the same boat as a lot of people. If anyone has any advice on how I can handle this, please let me know. I want to know if there’s anything I can do about this. People are telling me conflicting things. So far I know that my lead would have to go to leadership about the key children. I don’t know why she hasn’t yet. I have been told that the district can evaluate children with permission from the parents?

I don’t believe I should be the one sending an email. My lead said she doesn’t mind bringing these children up to leadership. 

I want to quit, but nowhere will pay me like this school does. I know I should suck it up, but I am near tears sometimes at work.

The alternate route program is classes all about learning theory, classroom management, creating engaging lessons, etc. but the thing is... none of it seems to really apply to what is going on in classrooms right now. For example, our teacher and books love to talk about activities like ""think, pair, and share"" and my admin also loves to talk about how we should be using that often in class. 

But my students just... don't do it. Maybe 20% of the do. The rest just sit there staring at me or off in space (they're pretty good about keeping phones away, thankfully). I'll prompt them to think, pair, share, or discuss something, or come up with an answer, I'll walk around the room and ask guiding questions, clarify, etc. but they just don't do it. They don't do any of the activities that my textbooks recommend. They're literally just waiting to get back on their phones as soon as the bell rings. So yeah, these education classes are great... in theory. In practice, it feels like the education landscape is entirely different from how it was when these books were written. Or maybe it was never like that?

I just don't know what to focus on right now to make things better. I'm starting to feel a little hopeless because even when I put together and go through what I think are great lessons, it just doesn't seem to stick for them. Admin has observed my classroom a bunch and gives me great feedback, they love my lesson plans and teaching style, but then when I give a very reasonable quiz or test, half of the students completely bomb it. The ones who care do amazing, and the ones who are super smart but don't really engage do reasonably well, and then the rest... it's honestly like they don't even read the questions and just answer randomly. I'll put together multiple choice questions that, even if you don't know the answer, you can reason through it pretty readily, and they select the answer that is 100% obviously not correct. I've reviewed test taking strategies, gone over how to analyze individual questions and cross off some of the answers, worked on studying and memorization techniques, and it just does. not. land. for at least 50% of all of my students. 

Is this just how it is right now? Is there something I can work on? I know I'm new, and I have so much to learn and improve on, but sometimes I just feel like I'm constantly spinning my wheels despite trying so hard to get through to them. ",teaching

1696033784.0,Thoughts on changing the paradigm,"EDIT--7th Grade!!

Hi colleagues. I vented a few weeks ago about having a rough first week. So 4 weeks on, 10% of the school year wasted, I've started getting into power struggles with students. They throw everything they have and I'm human, I deflected and avoided them for about a week, the best I could. But my class has been very chaotic so far and it's killing me. Here's a list of the behaviors that I can't stop:

-being out of assigned seats without permission; often constantly

-speaking out of turn and/or over other people

-near-constant socializing

-either ignoring or not being able to comprehend that the teacher is trying to address the class,and thus 

-not being respectful to the learning, classmates, or the teacher

-backtalk (the power struggles!)

-not taking no for an answer (the ODD kid asked to use the bathroom as work avoidance ~60 times in one 30 minute period!)

-being off task in general

It's led to a lot of yelling for the first time in my long career. 

So today I asked my admin for intervention. They are open to it. I arranged for the school CYW to spend one period per day in my classroom building community. I arranged for another teacher to observe my class for a morning to give feedback because I can't see the forest for the trees. In the last 3 weeks I have made easily 30 phonecalls home, many to the same parents, and the behaviors continue.  What I need is advice on getting back to my usual baseline. How to act more professionally so I'm respected by the students as a professional. Right now my biggest mistake is the power struggles that have squandered all professional respect I might have otherwise earned from these challenging students. By the way, they are a notoriously challenging cohort and last year's teacher went on stress leave. I'm a couple of years from retirement and I want to do it the right way, salvaging the dynamic.

They can’t copy the sentence starters I provide for them and/or complete the sentences. I know it sounds odd to be writing in art and to have this type of problem but it is part of our curriculum to be able to analyze and write about art. And the others that can do these things, finish in half the time because they’re more advanced or they are off the walls with their behavior. They don’t sit still or shout instead of raising their hands for my attention. Of course I can go over expectations with everyone again, but some of these 7th graders really remind me more of elementary schoolers in how they need their hands held through the assignments versus the ones that are actually at grade level or higher.

Back when I was 19, I made the decision to go to college in France, because tuition was basically free at the time. I studied modern literature, ended up completing 2 years, then dropped out and went back home and worked for a few years. A couple years ago, I decided to go back to school and finish my degree at my state university. The fastest way for me to graduate was to do a major in French, since most of my credits came from classes taught in French, even though the actual course content was in literature. It just happened to be taught in French, but we had a lot of comparative literature classes where we studied English works.

Now I'm looking to get my teaching certificate for high school English in California, which I unfortunately didn't plan for while in school. While I'm fluent in French, I definitely would not want to be a world language teacher, so I feel like I wrote myself into a corner by trying to graduate as quickly as I could.

What gets me is that if I were to take a subject matter test in English lit, I would certainly pass. But I don't think I'm going to qualify for the single subject cert since I don't have a major in English. Am I going to have to go back for a master's?",teaching

1695865492.0,Bad Student Evals Are Making Me Second-Guess My Career Path,"Hello! I first just wanted to note that I’m not looking for advice about changing my career path, but rather encouragement and advice on how to move forward.

I (28F) am about the graduate from college with my Ph.D. and am interested in going into academia to teach at a more teaching-focused college or university. 

Last semester, I taught my first course as the instructor of record. I used my Ph.D. advisor’s course lecture notes and assignments, as he was teaching the other section. Throughout the semester I could tell I was making mistakes. I didn’t know how to answer more specific questions or explain certain topics very well. I made excuses for mistakes in the notes and often came to class extremely tired and not thinking very clearly (I have a diagnosed sleep disorder and have finally gotten medication for it). I had some days where I felt everything went well, and others that were a complete flop. My course evaluations 100% reflected this. Several students mentioned how they liked me, but the majority made comments about how obvious it was that I was a first time instructor, that I struggled explaining some of the material, etc.

The problem is, is that I loved teaching. I know where I went wrong, and if I taught again (not just this class, but any class), I really feel like I could do so much better. I’ve grown so much more confident in my abilities, and feel like I could truly fix the mistakes I had made previously. When I taught, I was scared and easily flustered so I basically said anything that would come to mind with minimal filter, so i did make a lot of excuses that I should not have or would forget how I prepared to explain something. My advisor keeps telling me it’s mostly a confidence issue as well as an experience issue, and that I should take the reviews as an attack, but rather a learning experience.

Now I’m applying for jobs in academia, and looked at my students evals while writing a teaching statement. The evals have really made me question everything. I don’t doubt that I’d love to be an instructor, and that I’ve learned from my last experience - but how can I possibly talk about my effective classroom strategies when I essentially failed last semester? I think I can do better, but is that true? Will I ever be a good instructor? I’m really worried because I just want what’s best for my students.

Vaguely mortified, I immediately corrected myself, and, after Student C had finished, turned back to try to see if Student A had in fact wanted to say something earlier; she said she did not.

Only at that point did I fully realize that my error might have had an effect beyond just seeming like I was rather scattered: both Student C and Student A are young women of the same race, such that I imagine they very well might have felt like, by calling one the name of the other, I had mixed them up in the sense of not being able (or caring enough) to tell them apart. The moment had already passed for an immediate apology--beyond my initial quick correction--and, though I was now infinitely more mortified, it felt like apologizing after the fact would just make things worse by calling more attention to it. I still think that's true, but also feel terrible knowing that it might very well have made those students feel overlooked or less valued as individuals than their peers....

If I had in fact mixed them up, I would know what to do--apologize, commit to actually knowing them as individuals, and then do better--but this feels trickier. Certainly, I still intend to do better--first by reflecting and making sure that it was actually a genuine mistake (hence reconstructing it as above) and then by working to demonstrate in other ways that I in fact *don't* have trouble telling them apart--but since it was a genuine, one-off, unrelated slip of the tongue that could have, and in fact has, happened with other pairs of students, I don't quite know what else to do to try to ensure these students don't continue to feel less valued....other than ask for advice and see if anyone here has ideas for how it might be best to (or not to) address this and/or move on.",teaching
1695832732.0,I'm starting this Sunday?? :)),"Hello! 

This Sunday will be my first day ever with being a teacher. A third grade English teacher to be specific. I'm only 21 but I think I'm ready... 

I'm confident that hopefully, I can do it but the first step is always the hardest for me so I'm kind of anxious about it. 

I came here to ask you for some tips and what makes a good teacher, things I should avoid things I should expect etc etc etc anything that can help, it would mean a lot to me. I did a lot of research but learning from others would be way more helpful I think. I don't know if it helps to mention this: the kids first language is Arabic, so English is their second language. 

I shadowed classes for three days so I kind of have a general idea about everything, I have the students book and workbook and some flashcards. Picture cards too!! And I'm doing my best preparing and all. 

I'm very kind... like very very very kind and that's not always right when it comes to teaching... 

The teacher I admire to be is a strict and fun teacher, just don't know how to be strict aah maybe ill get the hang of it with time. But i know that the first impression is very importanttt.

1695842013.0,What kind of 3D printed props you'd appreciate having?,"Hello everyone!

I've been a 3D printing enthusiast for a few years now but one thing that I've hoped to see more is 3D printed props/resources that could be helpful for teaching. I'm surprised I haven't seen this done, basically at all. 

I'm wondering if there's something you'd think could be useful in a school setting. Maybe animal skulls for biology? Atom model that can be assembled together for chemistry? 

I feel like there's a lot of untapped potential if these things would have open-source design and could be cheaply 3D printed, even at the school itself. Considering how many free and open-source designs are already being designed I'm sure we could get the 3D printing community to produce a set of freely available resources for anyone to use.

If I don’t directly tell them the information, they will not learn it on their own. 

I have them reading and writing almost every day as well, but they barely try and most of the time don’t understand even the most basic readings. 

We’re on block schedule (18 weeks/90 minute classes) so I can’t spend a lot of time on topics especially in my world history classes. This really limits things like projects and group assignments. If I give homework for flipped classroom instruction they do not do it. 

My students seem to really enjoy my class and teaching style but my admin is constantly getting on to us about how bad direct instruction is and pushing us to find new ways to teach, though they don’t offer any solutions.

I really thought that this was what I wanted to do going into college. Unfortunately, I am coming to the realization that I just don’t have what it takes to teach. First of all, I have pretty crippling social anxiety. The amount of stress that I am under just being around so many people all day is really taking its toll on me. On top of that, as a SPED teacher, I am expected to have frequent communication with parents and keep them informed. I had to call a parent last week about their child and I spent 30 minutes trying to hype myself up to finally hit the dial button. The day after that, I was sent home after having a breakdown in the middle of class. I knew this job would be tough for me and I also struggled in my student teaching labs, but I thought I would just be able to suck it up and get used to it. The main reason that I pursued this career was that I have always enjoyed working with people with disabilities and I wanted to make a difference in kids’ lives. In my past labs and student teaching, I built great relationships with students. Six weeks into this school year, and I feel no connection whatsoever to my students. I also just feel completely lost when it comes to lesson planning and paperwork. I am a completely inadequate teacher and I know these kids deserve better than that. My mental health is deteriorating and I feel like a complete failure. My parents paid so much to put me through school and I really do not want to let them down, but I do not know if I can take this for much longer. I don’t know where to go from here.

Leaving mid-year would mean I’d have to pay the district a fine, 2. I have one more year until I get my standard license (I’m on my initial right now), so if I quit I’d lose my license completely and have to start over, and 3.

1695716627.0,How to talk to student about how it is going," I'm new in the field but loving it! Teaching science in first grade of high school.

The  other day I got a message from a student (""student A"") in my class that  he was annoyed and disappointed about his buddy (""student B"") in the  recent science experiments. Student A was complaining that student B  wasn't doing anything, just idling and not participating, and it was  dragging down the experience and learning for student A. He asked me if  he could please be put in another group.

I  answered that I was glad he reached out, that groups had already been  redone (by other teachers - we have the same groups across subjects for a  given class for the first couple of months), but that I would have a  chat with student B.

My question  is how do you guys recommend that I reach out to student B. Asking him  to stay around 5 minutes after class would be my intuitive idea, but I  don't want to put him on the spot too much in front of his peers if they  hear that ""the teacher wants to talk with him.. oohh what could it be!""

1695732675.0,Student Teaching this upcoming semester.,"Hello everyone, really need some guidance and some help. 

I live in Michigan and wrapped up Pre-Student teaching last April. Due to some health complications, I had to move Student Teaching requirement to this upcoming winter semester, but after that I’ll be completely finished and have earned my degree. Secondary Ed, concentration in English. I still have to take the MTTC to get licensed, but I’m not particularly worried about that. 

I feel woefully unprepared and completely ignorant on what I’m even supposed to be doing and what’s expected of me. 

My mentor teacher during Pre student teaching was great, welcoming and super nice. I appreciate all she did to ease my anxiety and make me feel apart of the classroom. She was genuinely wonderful. 

The issue is that dynamic made me complacent. I feel like I didn’t get much out of it or grow professionally from the experience because outside of spear-heading a few lessons, I didn’t do all that much. 

I was hesitant to force myself into her processes because at a fundamental level, it wasn’t my class and I didn’t feel comfortable compromising the students learning with my amateur understanding and ability. 

I imagine this is not a wholly unique experience, but none of my education thus far has supplemented any of it or filled in any gaps. 

I don’t know what an IEP is, what the grading structure is supposed to be, how to grade an essay, how many lesson plans I should have day 1, how many of them should be topically contiguous, how to even delineate what reading and writing level a particular student is currently at, etc…

None of my education up to this point has talked about literally any of this. It’s been 4 years of Shakespeare and nebulous discussion about theoretical pedagogy. 

I was a delinquent ass kid in highschool. 0.0 GPA, vandalizing shit, more days suspended and barred from the school than otherwise, etc…

I wanted to teach because I love reading and writing, and I wanted to share that passion with students who don’t currently see it’s value. I wanted to teach them how to use art and the stories they watch to self actualize and express their own humanity outside of mindless consumption.

But right now, I had to google how to abbreviate and cite my states reading standards on my own time. Actually interpreting what any of it means in practice? Forget about it. 

I’ve taken 20ish grand in student loans and I genuinely feel like I’ve gotten nothing from it. 

I’m fully confident I can find a way to coast and bullshit my way through the job. I’m not worried about that. I can navigate enough disciplinary meetings and performance reviews well enough to learn where the land mines are, but I don’t wanna do that. 

I want to give the job the respect it deserves, otherwise why am I doing it? It’s not for the money lol. I grew up a dirt poor child of immigrants in Brooklyn. No diapers, 1 bedroom apartments with 7 people, 8+ evictions (if my memory is correct). A teachers salary is more than I ever thought I’d make. 

I dunno. I feel about as qualified and ready to do this as a Craigslist electrician. 

Anyone else feel the same? Advice? Is this a ubiquitous experience and I’m just being melodramatic?

Thanks folks.",teaching

I graduated last December with my Bachelors of Art in Art History and a minor in Studio Arts. There was no Art Education in my university at all. The only path has been getting the B.A. then getting the alternative certification. 

That being said, I have two options for an alternative certification.

Number 1 is going to my state university (Texas) into their ACP program, $10,000 USD. They are the ones that put you in the classroom as a Student-Teacher for 2 semesters. However, a job is not guaranteed. Most likely you get sent to the outskirts of the city to far away schools. 

Number 2 is getting an alternative certification through a private business, $5,500 USD. However, I have to find a teaching job myself, then I can apply for the certification program. 

I don’t know if I can teach as an actual teacher while getting my certification, I find the student-teaching path easier, although more people expensive. Plus, how can I even get a job without the certification? I’ve been substituting for about a year now. But idk if I can just walk in asking for a job as an Art teacher. 

Have any of you gotten a job as a teacher without the certification. 

I’m only 24 and fresh out of college, I think my chances are low. My mom says that $10,000 is too much on top of my $80,000 student loans, but I think it’s the only realistic path I can take.

I am about a month into being a “paraeducator” (take this with a pinch of salt, because they have me doing an RBT’s job with paraeducator pay) at an elementary school in my town - for context, this is my old elementary school and a lot of the staff know me as they’ve been there for a while and I have a good relationship with them, the principal however, is new within the last 4 years and refuses to instill any discipline on kids - I don’t mean horrible discipline either - I mean suspension or even a talking to by the principal after punching teachers and other children in the face - and other multitudes of violence - some of which parent(s) have threatened to sue the school because of it, I always feel like I’m walking on eggshells. I have been punched in the face, kids have tried to stab my hand with a pencil and scissors, and most of these were within the first week or two. The rest of the time, I am berated and for lack of a better phrase, my mental health has declined rapidly. I will admit that I lose my temper with these kids, I am 22 and my mother was a SPED paraeducator while I was growing up, and I was a substitute teacher, and long term substitute paraeducator since I was 19 - and the way these kids treat their teachers and peers makes me sick, so of course I will raise my voice a bit when they’re not listening. It is what I was taught working in the system my whole working life. The salt in the wound was when the principal looked at me and told me she “had such high hopes for me with my background in substituting and working in [their after school program] for 6 years.” Said program I only stopped working in because it was shut down with covid. She then ended it all by saying “we had expectations, and I’ve only dissapointed her.” And then proceeding to say something about the 3 month probation, which I don’t remember much about - I kind of shut down.

Like I said, I am now on probation because of this. I was told my tone was embarrassing children when they don’t listen, and my language is unacceptable. (I have never once sworn, the worst sentence I’ve ever said is “you are acting like a jerk to your classmates and need to apologize, because right now they don’t want to play with you” to a fourth grader. I now see that this was wrong, but I do not regret it. He fixed his behavior.) These kids are horrible and the lack of discipline really does get to them. They run around yelling racial slurs at the mandarin teacher, and eachother, get into fights, and throw food at eachother and yell across the cafeteria during lunch. I just don’t know what to do, I wanted to become an art teacher - it’s been my dream and what I’m working towards, but after this first month … I don’t know if I can take it. Working in a school used to be fun when I was substituting or being a long term para sub, but after getting a job here, I regret it. First opportunity I’m quitting, that’s decided for sure. I just don’t know what to do now, because being told I’m on probation a month into my job was my breaking point. My mental health is in the drain and the thought of going into work now is something I truly dread. Is this the same experience for every school? Or is mine just going down the drain.

..............
Howdy friends. 

I posted the other day asking for advice for a new teacher who is changing careers and has never taught. My background is working public policy with a portfolio that covered child welfare, education, environment, green energy, and public health. While in college I worked for a non-profit in the foster care space and did a lot of work on pediatric behavioral health services in undeserved communities. 

The biggest thing I'm hearing about is classroom management. I've perused this subreddit and read some awesome threads and got some good ideas. But I want to specifically talk about Middle School. While at that non-profit, I was the Director for a summer camp for kids in Foster and Kinship care. I got a little bit of experience in managing 30 kids at a time (aged 5 to 13), but not extensive....

I'll be teaching 6th Grade Science. Science was my first love, but I never thought I was smart enough for STEM growing up. I spent the last couple months trying to get into Science and Space Policy work in DC (my dream job is to be the guy that yells at congres to invest in science and education), but I decided to apply for my County's Alt-Cert teaching program on a whim....and to my surprise, it worked out. (I had considered changing my PoliSci degree to Education in my second year of college, but I was already an older college student and felt the pressure to get a paying job to cover my bills. I felt it was too late for me to take a year off for student teaching...)

Not being experienced with Teaching itself is going to put me at a disadvantage. What classroom management tips do other middle school teachers like? What has worked for you, what hasn't? I want to have some idea of a strategy before I go in on my first day, so I'm less likely to be eaten alive. If managing that summer camp taught me anything, it's that middle schoolers love to push boundaries and can be a bit scary.

And what books do you like on the topic...I'll be driving about 22 hours round trip here in a couple days, and will have ample time to consume some audiobooks.

A lot of the basic academic stuff they struggle with is frustrating but I also understand how things have gotten to that point. But I can’t wrap my head around how they’re SO BAD at the most basic problem solving, or just noticing shit that’s right in front of them. Like, they are oblivious to so much, and they’re so passive and helpless. 

Like I said, I don’t actually think they’re as dumb as they seem — when they are able to focus they can do a lot more, and they obviously have other skills and talents in different areas. And I get that covid/virtual learning, cell phones and social media, etc. have done a number on their brains. It’s just really shocking seeing them struggle with things that should be like second nature.

So forced to do so, I changed my percents and yeah. I felt like I didn’t have a choice since I was confronted like that.

1695431872.0,No Good Title. Writing/teaching help ?,"I'm working as an English's tutor. An exercise I recommend to intermediate/advanced students is to listen to podcast they are interested . Once finished, spend 5-10 minutes writing about what they just learned as though they were teaching the information to a close friend.

(Not my main question, but I'd like to hear if you think this exercise is better, worse, or the same to telling them ""write about what impacted you the most"" )

The main question:

I listen a lot of podcast on productivity, business, coaching, communication etc... Along the way, someone mentioned a 5-10 question framework you can ask when you want to retell or reteach something you've heard/learned before. Like a ""who, what, when, when, where, why"" framework. However, in the context of a teacher / coach / speaker.

I would like to add something like that to the exercise.   There is also flip to this where instead of the questions / framework being directed at the information you will teach on, they are focuses on the ""needs"" of the audience. Sadly, I only vaguely remember that podcast.

  
Ps. This is a free for all question, even if you don't know exactly what I'm asking, I'll take your two-cents if you want to chime in. The majority of the students are in international business / trade or software development.

Longer explanation: I have a B.A. in English and a Master's in education. Because of my B.A. in English, I have the coursework to be certified in middle and secondary English. All I would need to do is take the state certification tests. I'm starting to get a bit burnt out by the neediness and intensity of primary grades, and the independence of older grades, as well as a deeper dive into writing and literary analysis, is appealing to me. It's what I initially wanted to do, but I fell into elementary by chance and loved it enough to stay.

I'm seriously considering the shift but also know that is is a huge shift, and very different styles of teaching and content. I'm less worried about the content as I am with the age group, parents, and classroom management; these areas will probably be different than what I experience now.

This is mostly a vent, but looking for possible ideas/solutions as well. I have been employed as a full time teacher at the middle/highschool level for 10 years. This summer my husband and I decided to make a significant move back to our hometown. Initially, I planned to use this move as a way to transition out of teaching all together but of course was reached out to by a local elementary school in need of a .5 FTE librarian, and decided to take it due to the schedule (3 day on 3 days off). It is over a 50% pay decrease from my previous position and offers no benefits, but I have a two year old at home (our only), that I am desperate to spend more time with and decided that the poor pay and lack of benefits would be worth it to have three days off to spend more time with her. Flash-forward to the school year and I immediately regret the decision. The first red flag came when my mentor suggested I send my daughter to daycare an extra day so I could come in (UNPAID) an extra day of the week due to the workload expectations. I am a hardworking employee, but the reason I took this job is to have a better work life balance. I also need to take 6 additional university credits by the end of the year that are paid for out of my own pocket to be employed as a librarian rather than a teacher which is a significant time commitment outside of the prep hours needed to teach 7 different grade levels back to back every day. When I was hired, I was told there was a “curriculum” available. It turns out that curriculum is nothing more than a vague list of standards, so lesson planning has been all on me.I can mostly deal with all of that but  here is where I need advice: the past two weeks I have been invited to multiple “required” meetings after school from 4-6 on days that I am not scheduled to work. The expectation is basically that I will drive in to attend these meetings on my days off even though the meetings are not directly related to my content or job. I’m beyond frustrated about this. I was led to believe my schedule was 3 days on, 3 days off. These meetings are cutting into the flexibility I was under the impression I would have. ( for example, I want to do a zoo trip with my daughter tomorrow, but am told I must attend this meeting after school). I’m paid under 30,000 a year with no benefits. I find this to be an unreasonable expectation. Is this normal for .5 fte teachers? How would you go about approaching admin about this?

1695176349.0,I'm in need of some teaching help.,"Hello, I'm an ESL teacher in Thailand and I'm struggling to figure out what to teach or how to teach. I didn't major in education but I do have a degree and I got an ESL certificate (which was basically handed to all of us). All of the training I got in the ESL cert classes was also basically rendered useless once I was told what the job expectations were.

They told me to teach listening and speaking. I'm not supposed to teach grammar, reading, or writing since that's what the Thai teachers do. I can correct their grammar as I notice mistakes, but it's supposed to be through speaking. I also wasn't given a curriculum, materials, or a teaching assistant and this is my first ever teaching job. I've tried quite a few things but it's basically one failed lesson after the next. Very few of them ever engage, the ones that do are already basically fluent in English, and none of them are really learning anything.

I was told by another teacher, who's been here for 15+ years, that our job is more about playing games and building the students' desire to learn English. But I have no idea how to do that. All of the lessons I got in the ESL cert classes were for teaching grammar through modeling and drilling and then giving them a worksheet.

When I tried teaching these grammar lessons, the students already knew all of the words and grammar I had to teach. But when I tried doing other things, they were all completely lost or uninterested. Things I've tried so far: Have them make a presentation on themselves and speak it in front of the class, act out a 1-3 minute video as a group by speaking, write a short story as a group with speaking parts, I gave them a paragraph to read (another teacher does this, so I thought I'd try it), singing songs that the kids chose, and more. All of these failed horribly in nearly every class. One class was successful with some of them because the students have the desire to learn without me and we had a lot of fun. But that's about 30/400 students that responded well. So my overall success rate is very low.

Here's my question: How do I spend my class time with them? How do I encourage them to speak English using games when most of them don't understand what I'm saying or sometimes don't care about participating?

I've seen ESL games online but they're often far too easy and uninteresting for the middle school students I teach. I've tried some and they either knew every word immediately or got bored and stopped responding 10 minutes in.

I just have no idea how to get them to speak or even listen sometimes. I've felt so scrambled trying to figure out what to teach that I haven't focused as much on how I'm teaching it either. At some point I defaulted into lecturing like I'm a college professor (which I know isn't helpful) because I feel like I'm grasping at straws.

1695042593.0,Need advice on how to rapidly change things while I can before this becomes another exhausting year.,"I‘m a second-year teacher who struggled a lot with classroom management last year but felt like I developed a lot and was getting a hang of it by the end of last year. 

In my country we move up grades with our students. So as a homeroom teacher of a 5th grade I moved with my students to 6th grade this year.
 The problem with this is that I can‘t start fresh with all the tools I have acquired  last year so they still remember that I wasn‘t so consequent and there were things that they could get away with. My biggest problem was that they were constantly loud and talking when they were supposed to be listening. 

Despite this I was optimistic that summer break and the new school year would provide me a perfect opportunity to establish new expectations and enforce them 100% this time. 

However I got assigned with a co-homeroom teacher who is experienced, has this natural authority and who doesn‘t really need these expectations spelled out because they are automatically enforced when she is inside the room.  She quickly dominated the lessons the first two weeks of school and while I was still trying to figure out my new role in the classroom and how to co-teach with her I missed my moment to establish myself differently this year and I can already see how they are starting to behave the same way they did last year. 

Adding to that, I feel kind of steamrolled by that co-teacher. I‘m trying to see this as a learning opportunity but I‘m also having a hard time adjusting to my new role after being the student‘s main teacher last year. She wants me to be proactive and to understand what needs to be done without the need to communicate much. I‘m sensing from her that she thinks I‘m too passive in the classroom whereas I‘m really just trying to find a balance of supporting her while also trying adjust to this new role as co-teacher. 
Also if I’m being super honest with myself, I‘m losing confidence next to her which in turn makes me demotivated. That in turn makes it really hard to find the energy to become that proactive person she needs.

This also works great for groups in classes, seating charts, and more.

Students can also join your team and enter preferences from their own devices.

You can block pairs of students from being in a group together.

The tool keeps track of previous group generations and students that have been in a group together before are less likely to end up in the same group again.

1694906855.0,Support for international students?,"I’m a first year teacher beginning my journey in a small town high school. I like it here, but what surprised me is that I have three international students.

They are all wonderful kids, and are eager to learn, but I teach 9th Grade American history, which in my state is 1877 to the present, and they have no background for this kind of stuff.

1694867768.0,Talkative class; dreading observation results,"I’m a 6th year high school ELA teacher and at a new school this year. My 3rd period is my squirrelly class. As admin is wont to do, they put several of the same type of kid in my class without paying attention to it.

It’s generally 3 boys and I’m 99% sure they all have ADHD, unmedicated. One talks to literally anyone and anything. He constantly says random silly things to sometimes no one. The second is just silly and playful. He clearly wants positive attention from me. The third is loud and obnoxious, sometimes wanting positive attention, sometimes toeing the line of play talking back. None of them are disrespectful, rude, or mean. 

I’ve had classes like these in the past. IMO, this behavior is annoying and can be disruptive if not quelled but ultimately it doesn’t warrant anything more than corrections in class, a talk in the hallway, or a call home. I feel like with these kids, you have to toe a very fine line of getting them to work with you vs hating you and causing even more problems. 

But here’s where my issues come. I have one child in this class who’s mother is a secretary at our school. This school is a high performing charter but has the attitude of a private school. She cornered me in the copy room the other day and told me how the kid had apparently told his mom how my class was out of control and pure chaos. It’s not. We get our work done every day, no issue. She then proceeded to “give me the DL” on each of these kids and who I should call, including the assistant principal to come jerk them out of class. The third student she told me “he’s new here. He clearly doesn’t understand how we are here.” 😑 I told her politely thanks but no thanks and left. 

I specifically chose this class for my first observation bc they participate and answer me unlike some of my other classes. Is it energetic and like a bunch of puppies? Absolutely. But I much prefer that over a dead silent wall of nothing. So my AP came to do the observation and the kids were better but still energetic. I tried a Jamboard thing bc we’d just used it at PD the day before and I liked it. Some were off task, playing with the features, having side convos, but I addressed it every time. Responses: “yes ma’am, I’m sorry.” We finished what I’d planned for. 

My AP later cornered student 2 in the hall and asked him “is your class always like that?” He was upset bc he’d asked me if they’d acted better and I said yes. He came to me later and said “idk if we’re in trouble but Ms. X said this to me today.”

She and I discussed the class at my pre-observation and she was so adamant about calling home or calling her so she can come get them. There is no detention room option. It’s I handle it, Parent handles it, straight to ISS which is sitting in admin’s office all day. I don’t agree with this at all. Unless we’re talking about blatant disrespect, violence, etc. While these kids are being obnoxious, my comparison of them to puppies is accurate. Nothing they’re doing is out of malice. It’s just like they don’t fit into this tiny little neat box of “well behaved student” the school likes to tout. When I discussed this with a coworker, she asked if one of them was black and student 3, the new one from an inner city school, is. She said this school claims to be diverse but rides it’s minority students hard. 

I’m dreading my observation results. My brain is catastrophizing to it being my lowest one ever. How do I have this conversation with my AP about our clearly different opinions on behavior management without getting fired? I don’t want these little robot students who refuse to participate or make jokes or be silly. How are we supposed to act out Macbeth later on with students like that?

Anyway, thanks for reading.",teaching
1694860067.0,Is it normal for a language teacher to not speak like a native ?,"Hi,

I'm a young teacher and I graduated in Language Teaching (with very good grades). Before I started teaching, I thought I would be qualified for it. The problem is, when I have to talk for a long time or when I have to write essays or messages in my target language, I often don't sound like a native. I won't make big grammar mistakes, but will misuse a word or speak, a bit like a textbook quite often. I think it's because of the teaching of languages in my country. When you want to become a language teacher, you have to take a bachelor/master degree in Language Teaching. Those courses are perfect for learning pedagogy and grammar analysis, but we have almost no occasion to practice the language. As a result, I know I'm quite qualified to analyze and explain the language, but my speaking skills are not close to the skills of native speakers.

Is it a normal, well-known problem among non-native teachers, or am I just not skilled enough to teach ?

P.S : English is not my native language, and I don't teach english neither.",teaching
1694873267.0,What to replace lectures with?,"This is my second semester teaching and lecturing is killing me. I teach American History 1.5hr blocks

There are a few kids in every class who participate but it’s like pulling teeth. They hate it and it always puts me in a terrible mood when I make this PPT and try to get them to engage and they flat out refuse.

A typical schedule for my class would be:

Monday: HW in class time for 30 min / Powerpoint Lecture for an hour

Tuesday: Mini essay responses (usually 10 free writing activities based on the chapter, so 10 questions that will be answered in a brief paragraph per question)

Wednesday: Vocab and reading quiz / 45 min of free time to work on homework.

Thursday: Lecture

Friday: Repeat

And then a test on the chapter. Tests on units as they’re repeated.

I know most of the kids aren’t reading the book and just scanning it to answer their questions and so I make these powerpoints to lecture so I know they get ALL the information needed but most of them don’t even take notes or participate.

Idk how to enforce reading the book and I feel taking PPT notes + reading is the best for really learning the material.

Their typical homework for a chapter is usually end of chapter questions (10-15) which is like a mini quiz and I have them justify their answers in a sentence or two. Vocabulary definitions (10-30). 

We do usually 2 chapters a week.

Without lecturing that opens 2-3 hours a week of free time — should I replace it with more engaging activities? 

How can I enforce reading the book more?

I’m so scared my EOC scores are going to drop this year and I’m not a history buff, I want to teach composition or LA. 

Stressed and admin has been no help with lesson planning

Edit: Thank you all so much, this was incredibly productive!!! This week will have no lectures and a more segmented daily schedule divided between activities. Please feel free to comment any activities you might suggest.

1694536259.0,"Students were transphobic to me, not really sure how to respond/discipline.","Hi y'all, so I'm a first year sub and had a question on something not quite sure how to deal with. 

So I'm transfem (23) while I pass very well visually, my voice I use in class definitely doesn't pass. It's just very difficult to do a fem voice at the higher volumes, I can only really manage at a conversational volume rn and even that still needs more work. So I just use my neutral more masculine voice for consistency at the moment. 

So anyway, I was subbing 6th grade the other week. I had a few kids for two periods, one at the start at the day and one at the end. In the second period they started laughing at my voice while I was doing introductions. I asked them ""what was so funny?"" They giggled a bit more and then stopped. But after that the activity started, and they kept talking about my gender (and maybe about another trans student not in the class) in an inappropriate way. Then I had other students next class calling ""Mr.name, Er Ms.name"" across the classroom for laughs.

 Not really sure how I should clamp down on something like this. Kids having some disrespect to subs comes with the territory, I understand. But I do want to have my classrooms be a safe space and not feed queerphobia; even if I'm only there for the day. But I also don't want to be the ""woke teacher that goes overboard"" that gets clipped on some type of LibsofTikTok thing either. 

It's mostly a middle school problem and I already struggle enough with even basic classroom management in middle school. Highschoolers really don't seem to care besides an occasional pronoun clarification and I haven't done younger elementary yet.

As far as academics go, we have been working on recognizing and constructing their names and counting to ten. My SPED and Pre-K team have reassured me that I am doing good, but I’m just worried I’m not doing enough. 

My IA, who was in the classroom last year, has commented that she doesn’t agree my lessons and she has gone off and made her own assignments without asking me (such as cutting out the first letter of the students’ names and have them draw on them or painting with corn on the cobs). I am more than willing to modify our activities if she has an idea, but I just feel a little self-conscious that she doesn’t like my lesson plans so much she went off on her own to do something else.

I pull up an empty chair and am breaking it down for this student, when another young lady at a neighboring desk clump starts repeating in a kind of singsong voice at let’s say a 6 on the 1-10 loudness scale, with literally 3 seconds in between, “Oh, Mr. ____? Mr. ____? Mr. ____? Mr. ____?”

I should add that I did give her the “one second” gesture after the first name-call, but she kept this up a good 20 seconds until I finally looked at her and very gently, but also quite sternly, said to this ***eighth grader***, “So-and-so… can’t you see that I’m right in the middle of helping out Such-and-such? How would you like it if someone was interrupting me while I was trying to answer your questions? Probably not very much, right? Now please, stop repeating my name, sit tight and I’ll be right with you.”

The blank look on her face was as if she’d never been taught how to wait her turn before. That’s literally some 2nd grade-level behavior. She has no IEP, no 504, no real behavioral issues and is usually peachy in class, although she can be a little chatty.

I got a new student yesterday who came from a very rough district and thought things were similar here. I guess he realized his ‘big and tough, beat up the biggest guy to assert dominance’ routine wasn’t gonna cut it and he’s evolved into acting out just so he can get suspended. Day one was just cussing up a storm and begging to be let out of class so he can skip (yes he says he’s going to skip. He’s doing it intentionally.) long story short, it’s still not working for him. Today he’s evolved to sexual harassment (directed towards me) . He knows it’s unacceptable which is why he’s doing it but if I actually punish him according to school policy, he gets exactly what he wants. Teachers and admin are aware already and please do not give me any comments along the lines of placing him in a different class. I guarantee I’ve been told worse by scarier and he is not hurting my feelings in any way. I’m just nervous he’s going to escalate further but I’m about as stubborn as he is and don’t want to reward the behavior.

Tuesday he repeatedly told a girl during recess that he would pay to have sex with her. This was reported right away. He got lunch detention, parents notified, resources for counseling sent home, and the SRO had a talk with him. 

The girl has been crying in my class every day since. It’s her first year at this school and she has already made some great friends, but now she’s dealing with this. We talked for a while, she said boys would say inappropriate things at her old school and that she was bullied. I immediately emailed the counselor asking if anyone had notified her mom and asked if she would speak with her because this is clearly affecting her. Guys, I am shaking mad. NO ONE has talked to the girl about this, notified her mom, or sent her mom resources for counseling. No one even thought about the girl. It’s out of my hands at this point since it has gone to the VP, principal, and SRO. I asked the principal after school if she would notify the mom, stating that she has been crying and it is clearly affecting her. The principal didn’t even know the girls name. No one thought to speak with her. No one thought how she may be feeling. If I was a parent, I would be livid if I found out this happened to my child days after the fact. 

Is it wild of me to assume that the counselor or principal would speak to the girl after something like this? Is it wild of me to assume that they notified her mom that she was offered money for sex at school? Shouldn’t the girl get resources as well? Like I said, it’s out of my hands at this point.

At first I was very positive about using cellphone holders to put an end to distractions but I would like to ask veteran teachers here what they think. Should I have my whole class deposit their phones in the holder at the beginning of the class? Should I only require it during projects or other assignments or when some students simply won't stop looking at their phones? I don't assign too much homework or tests or quizzes since my department likes to emphasize classwork and projects instead.

What worries me, though, is that it seems like very few teachers are using phone holders and it makes me feel weird if I am one of the few who are using one. The students are not disruptive for the most part, it is just that some of them cannot stop going on their phones. I really wish that my school had one uniform policy for phones.

1693946670.0,"Looking to get INTO teaching: Some advice, besides what's wrong with me","As the text states, I am looking to come into this industry that people seem to be leaving in droves. What's wrong with me? I just turned 38 and have spent my entire career in the private sector. I've never been able to move up or advance myself at any company I've worked with, although I haven't been highly motivated at any job either. Teaching is something I've kicked around off-and-on since my college years, but I was too anxious to go for it in my 20s, and it seemed too daunting of a task. I also didn't think I'd have a snowball's chance in hell at getting a job going alternate route before COVID hit. I'm going through a rough time at my current employer and I'm starting to existentially question my career decisions again. I'd like to give this teaching thing a shot, but my fear is that I'll end up hating it like a lot of people that post in here do. I've always thought of teaching as a noble profession, I have always cared more about the subject matter (I have more interest in English than any products my company manufactures/sells and I LOVE history), and the money isn't terrible in my state (I live in New Jersey). I've heard a ton of horror stories about kids, parents, and everything in between, which makes me skeptical.

For my NJ teachers, I've looked into obtaining a CE [here](https://www.nj.gov/education/certification/cte/alternate.shtml). Per the attached link, I would need to have a BA (have one in Communications), Hygiene/Physiology req (I believe I passed a health class in college; if not, I can take the provided test), and that would make me a ""provisional teacher"". It's my understanding that I can apply to jobs with a CE and work as a teacher while completing the requisite CTE Teacher Prep program. Please let me know if this is correct or if there are bits and pieces of information I'm not clear on. With this, are there any postings I should look out for/won't be able to apply for?

If I procure a CE, will I just be expected to teach immediately upon getting hired? Is there any type of training/grace period or is it full bore, ""go""?

On another note, what do any teachers recommend that I do just to see if this may be for me? Substitute? Apply for any other roles?

1693916636.0,How to help someone with reading comprehension issues?,"Hello! I [20F] have a friend [18M] whom I’ll call “A”. A is brilliant. We met through mutual friends and eventually became close friends with each other. We play video games, debate philosophy, and write stories together. 

One of A’s friends (who went to school with him) warned me once that A was a “lazy” reader. He said that A would constantly ask other people to read for him. Sure enough, despite writing really well, A has asked me to read things for him. This ranges from long news articles to short Magic:The Gathering playing cards. I never asked about it. 

Recently, we were on a call together, debating as usual. He found an article, but I was busy and could not read it, so I asked him to read to me. He was slow and stumbled over words that I know for a fact he was familiar with. After reading, he sheepishly asked me to summarize what he had just read. I didn’t ask about it. 

Today, we were talking about learning disorders we had and how they affected us in school. He mentioned that he had difficulty reading. I asked him to elaborate. He said that he had a hard time seeing how letters fit into words, and how words fit into sentences. “And by figuring it out,” he said, “I lose the meaning of whatever I’m reading.”

He wants to read more (he currently mostly listens to audiobooks) but says that every time he tries, he gets frustrated and quits. I asked if he needed help. He said he would appreciate help, but he has no one to ask. I told him I would do some research and get back to him.

Doing this with minimal support and resources. I've only taught the Y11 EAL class before, and the others are new to me.

This year I was gifted with student aides (we call them “teacher aides” at my school), they’re former students when they had me for 10th grade ELA so they know how I work. 

After a lesson in rhetoric, an aide made a comment (as a side conversation) that he wondered if I “have a script” since it’s almost “word for word” and down to the references or jokes. 

I replied that “I teach the same two grades every day. This works for me and keeps my job easier.” I must add that he wasn’t being antagonistic or rude. It was an innocuous comment. 

But is this common? His comment made me wonder if I’m a hack or if this is just common/something new teachers rely on.

While ***Canva*** is enticing for making presentations, I stick to good ol' ***Google Slides.*** Everything is just so easy with them, and instead of sharing my ppt files to my students, I just give them the link.

This school’s quarters are not all 9 weeks. This first quarter is 6-7 weeks long. My heaviest weighted category is my summatives at 45% and it’s been told to me to be sure to get at least 5 of them before Oct 13. 

The school requires summer reading and I inherited the text selection from the teacher before me. I would have NEVER selected this text for independent reading. And it showed when they made me do a mini unit on it and it took an additional 1.5 weeks because the kids were absolutely clueless. And these were the ones that did it. 

I’m just now getting to my second unit. I have to have 2 more before Oct. I’m cutting things left and right to get lessons to stay on their assigned day. There is no wiggle room. No room to reteach. I feel like what’s left of my lessons is just “let me blab to you about a topic for 20 min and then you work in groups for 20 min only to not finish it and us not have time to review it before we move on.” Compared to my first five years of teaching, this feels so bland, rushed, and hollow. 

Has anyone had this issue? Any creative ideas for summative assessments?",teaching
1693408875.0,Career change/ Frustration,"Hello all. 
So I’ve come to the abrupt decision that I do not want to continue teaching any longer. This decision has absolutely nothing to do with teaching itself but everything to do with the work environment. First I should say this, I’m 25 and it may seem like I’m kicking the can too soon and maybe I am but I’ve been working/volunteering in educational teaching settings since I was 14/15. I’ve taught STEM programs, done sporting events, and assisted in other extracurricular activities prior to actually entering the profession. I was a SPED para for a year and now I’m in my third year of teaching.  I noticed when I was younger but now actually being in the field itself I don’t know how much more I can take. I’m in my third school and the dysfunction of our campus and especially the SPED department is too much that I am physically getting sick. During my para year I had a coworker that was just awful. He was rude, demeaning, gaslighting and just plain ugly. He quite literally made me and other employees cry! I moved into another school and where my mentor was supposed to mentor me, I spent more time dealing with her emotional/relationship issue, the death of a friend, being unappreciated and over used outside of my actual work duties, and treated like a child for being just a few years younger than them. So I left and now I’m in a new school. I feel so played, y’all. Like played to the max. I found this school and I was like this is it, this is the one. Nope! There is so much dysfunction, unorganized planning, a lack of structure, and so much coddling!! And let me tell you this coddling is not just directed to kids it’s staff and parents to. I am here to teach and provide resource/inclusion support to my kids and what am I doing? Behaviors, all day it’s behaviors! I can barely get to actually resource or inclusion and when I do?? This kids are smart! Grade level smart, could maybe go for some intervention but at most that’s it. Yet they have 20-35+ accommodations? None of which are academic related. I am try to ask for help or guidance from our new coordinators and there is none. And I just can’t anymore. What do I do??",teaching

My building exploded with numbers so four  of us are “co-teaching”.  My teaching partner and I each have our own homeroom in a giant classroom with a long chest-high bookshelf dividing the room. It’s a wonderful space — big windows and even an attached office space.  I teach math and science.  She teaches ELA and social studies. My teaching partner is amazing and we work really well together.  

We need resources, though.  I want to know how other partner teachers manage two classes. What are some different ways to divide kids?  How do you manage teaching lessons — combine content areas and do interdisciplinary units?  Teach your own thing?  How are big classrooms organized?  We have two giant rugs up front by the interactive white board but it’s not working well.  I need to better organize my space to accommodate all 43 kids.    

I’ve looked up everything I can on “co-teaching” and it doesn’t address TWO classes of kids in one big classroom.  I’ve tried “team teaching” and “partner teaching” as well.  I’ve looked on TikTok, YouTube and Pinterest.  Has anyone used this model before?  What did you call it?  Any tips?  Resource books, blogs or websites?

1693357900.0,Partner is strongly considering leaving for another profession,"Partner just started their second year teaching and as it has been horrible for them to say the least. It’s hard seeing them come home everyday completely drained, never any time to do anything they want to do. Constantly grading, creating lesson plans, the works - you all know the deal. The added stress and anxiety of increasingly misbehaved students, evaluations by incompetent administration, induction, the fact that they are undervalued and undercompensated, and pressure to coach a sport and join several committees is all weighing heavily on them and their mental health. I do not want to see them go through it anymore.

With that, we have determined over the last year that teaching is just not for my partner. They had high hopes and gave it their best shot but sadly it’s already time to hang up the towel. If the circumstances were different it would be an incredibly fulfilling career for them, but this is just not worth it and I don’t blame them. It's not just a matter of getting through these first couple years - we don't see the light at the end of the tunnel with a teaching career unfortunately.

Some details - in California teaching at a public high school, under contract, induction has not started yet and the district is paying for their induction process.

Questions:

A ) If my partner were to leave - in your experience or what you’ve seen amongst peers - what would likely happen if they left before the end of the school year and broke contract? Are there any consequences? Can the district come after them? Does my partner have any rights?

B ) The district is paying for the induction process - would that potentially have to be paid back since it would not be completed?

C ) Is there an amicable or recommended way to see if there’s a possibility of them being able to get released from the contract without causing an issue with the district or administration and possible retaliation?

D ) My partner is looking at moving to another industry entirely, can they apply to those positions even while under contract?

E ) Should my partner leave and potentially want to substitute in other districts in the future either part time or later on in life in retirement, would this cause an issue for them?

I’m sure a lot of these details are laid out in the contract. I’ve just pulled it up and will begin going through it after this post. Just hoped to get some insight or potential factors to consider from you wonderful people. Thank you for all that you do!",teaching

i (22f) have been in childcare for about 5 years give or take.

I was able to redecorate and organize a new classroom the way I prefer it and it’s quite cozy. We opened the room yesterday (Monday).

but i do need some tips on Emmy. 
She’s never been in a daycare setting, is an only child, and has been strictly breastfed. Emmy is fine when it’s just me and her but when Joey comes in, she swaps so fast. 
She screams and cries whenever i have to give Joey the tiniest amount of affection or just whenever i set her down, if she’s not in my arms in a certain position, you’re gonna hear about it. 
She also is on bottle strike and refuses to eat which makes mom have to come pick up after only being here for 3 hours or so. 

My question is, what can i do to comfort Emmy so that i’m able to best take care of her and Joey without her having a meltdown anytime i sit her somewhere?

And how do i help mom and dad get past this bottle strike so she will eat here?

How to work with that in others and in oneself?,"What I mean is - sometimes I see this attitude in my students (I teach languages) and I see that in myself as well (I study music): when **a person who enters some field of study sets some unreal expectations, TO WHICH they attach the ability to do the thing in general**. 

""I can't be a musician if I don't have an  absolute pitch"",  
 ""I can't say that I can speak English if I have accent"". 

that sounds funny even as I'm writing it but actually it's very very sad when people literally cry during the lessons when I say ""you missed out an article here, no big deal"" - but for them it turns into ""you will never speak English"". 

I still don't know how to work with that when I'm a teacher - and when I'm s student also! Now i'm learning violin and it takes me a lot of willpower not to cry over remarks my teacher makes about my intonation. She says - ""your B was a bit too flat"", I hear - ""you'll never be a musician"". 

What is even more bizzarre is that these criteria aren't usual perfectionism, they are very selective. It's not about not making any mistake ever. they are both very specific and very random.

 Like a violin student I'm OK with any corrections about my rhythm or bowing or sight reading, that's especially intonation that hits me hard. My language students sometimes are ok with accent but are devastated  when they forget a word. Other students laugh when they forget words and don't care about accent but  one mistake in verb tense - they're beatimg themselves hard on the head with a saucepan..

But  being so attached to work causes me too much stress, too much anxiety...  and none of it is worth it. Being on summer breaks puts all of it in  perspective. Floating on my back in the Caribbean in July it all became  so obvious --- none of it matters! None of it! All of the daily  annoyances are so freaking unimportant! ... so I resolved to care a  little bit less this coming school year... just to give less of a fuck  what happens.

... Then I've just  gotten an e-mail informing me of my program for this year. Without  getting too much into the weeds, I've been assigned courses that I've  expressed no interest in teaching. And it feels like my actual requests  and preferences have been ignored for years.

So  I'm spinning out. Stressed... mulling it over. And then I think...Ok -  so they want me to teach these courses.

We’d do a warm up daily, review it, and at the end of the quarter, I’d collect them and grade it. This helped a lot of kids and there were still some that still didn’t do their work no matter what I did so it wasn’t like it was 100s across the board. 

Well, now I’m at a new school. I had intended on continuing my previous practice but now I’m doubting it. An admin very nicely commented I currently have too many (seriously, it’s just 2) participation grades. She said it was odd they all had 100s. I explained what the activity was and she said still, it’s odd. But this is also in the same breath telling me the project grades I gave out are too low. 🤷‍♀️ 

So now I’m worried about my warm up grade, especially since it weighs more than a classwork thing. I mean, my warm ups are pretty involved so it IS a reflection of what they’ve done over the quarter. But I’m afraid I’m going to get yelled at if these higher performing kids I teach all actually do their work? It sounds ridiculous and it is. Like they can’t all have 100s but if I grade them too low, I get pissy parents calling admin behind my back. I feel like admin will say it doesn’t measure their mastery of a topic well enough.

When I was last teaching, I did a lot of work on paper. Toward the last two years of my last job, I did start moving toward a flipped classroom model but still used a lot of paper. Well, this new job has a copy limit. I get 3100 a month and I have 6 classes, 98 students total; not great but manageable for important things like quizzes. We are required to use Canvas. 

Personally, I hate Canvas. I feel there are a ton of other better options out there, but I digress. My issue I'm finding I have is finding a balance between graded and ungraded work. A coworker told me he just makes everything as graded on Canvas so the kids are guaranteed to do it and then he picks and chooses what goes into Powerschool. Idk how I feel about this. Parents are pretty intense at this school and I feel like if I did this, they'd be pissy about me making their kids do work that I say I'll grade but then don't. The alternative would be, code it as ungraded and hope they do it. These kids are pretty good so I think they might, but idk.

In my last job, when we did a lot on paper, I did exactly this though. I'd tell them as we were working on something that I was grading it, in real time. But maybe the issue here is we had more time in class to work then, 90 minutes, and here we have 45 minutes so a lot is assigned as homework (which I hate).

I am a first year teacher located in Pennsylvania and signed a contract in beginning of July at a charter school. I was told I was going to be an English teacher during my interviews and when signing contract, which is what my area of study in college is, but on the first day of orientation they told me they are changing me to a different subject that i know absolutely nothing about. They have known about this switch since the beginning of August but chose to wait and tell me the first day of orientation. Also, they told me I would have a classroom (and showed me what would have been my classroom during my second interview), but again, last possible minute day of orientation told me I wouldnt have a classroom and would be a floater. I’m extremely upset by this as I had two other offers but decided to choose this school, but if I knew any of these things would be the case I wouldn’t have chose this school. Also, if they would’ve told me about the change of subject when they first found out, I would’ve had ample time to give a 30 day notice like my contract states I have to give and look for another job.

Well we're doing it and they're laying down and then it comes time for them to get up and jump and she didn't move. At first I thought maybe she was just being silly and pretending to keep sleeping because sometimes her friends do that and kids copy each other, but then two of her friends tried to get her to stand up with them right away and she didn't respond to them which is extremely uncharacteristic so I immediately rushed over to her and moved the other kids away so I could kneel down to look at her and her eyes were rolled back so I could only see the whites and they were vibrating and I just knew she was having a seizure. It was only about two seconds later, but it felt like forever, when she came to. She saw me and just gave me the biggest smile and said ""HI MS.*name*!"" And practically jumped back to her feet. I told her to stay there so I could go grab my walkie and tell my boss to get her ass down here with a thermometer to check Sarah's temp and then when my boss got in the room I told her what happened and she checked Sarah's temp but she had a completely normal reading! She told me she'd call Sarah's mom and ask her what she'd like us to do, but to let Sarah continue on as normal as long as she felt okay and Sarah had said she felt good. Literally acting as if nothing had happened! Mom said if she starts acting weird to message her again and she'd come get her right away but because it only lasted maybe 10 seconds total that her doctors had told her previously that it wouldn't be something she necessarily had to come in for as long as she hadn't injured herself, which she had'nt. About half an hour later Sarah complained that her head hurt, and when I asked her where she said it was her forehead. I messaged mom and within 20 minutes mom was there to take her to the hospital.

1693065216.0,Feeling guilty over leaving job for another position at the start of the school year.,"Hello All!
I work as a school nurse & over the summer came across a dream job. I applied about a month ago, got an interview within days and an unofficial offer the next week! I just had to wait to officially accept until they presented me with the full salary information which they said would only take a day or two but ended up taking almost two weeks due to some internal issues on their end. The school year starts soon and I wanted to give them as much notice as possible but definitely didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure the new job was a done deal. (My direct supervisor knew and even provided me with an amazing reference but the principal and superintendent did not know)
       They finally got back to me with a great salary offer and apologized for taking so long. They pressed if at all possible starting in exactly two weeks would be ideal as there are trainings that I’ll need coming up that won’t be offered again for a few months. I agreed and signed the contract.
        That was Thursday, staff at my current position reports to the school Monday and students start on Wednesday. As soon as signed the contract with the new employer, I submitted my resignation to the principal and superintendent stating that this was my two week notice. I stated in the resignation letter that I knew the timing was not ideal but that I would do everything possible in my last two weeks to ensure a smooth transition.
        The next day I got an email from the superintendent saying- ""I must say that while I certainly understand your motivation for leaving for this career opportunity, this leaves the staff and students at XXX in a difficult situation, as school starts on Monday. With that being said, I will accept your resignation.""
          I feel that the only reason the superintendent would say that in his email is to make me feel guilty and/or shame me into staying. I'm so excited for this new position and want to feel happy and content with my choice but already felt guilty for leaving the school, staff and students on such sudden notice. His email makes me feel even worse and has me wondering if I am the AH?",teaching

1693055764.0,HELP PLEASE! Resources for Printing School Paper,"TL;DR: Does anyone have a great resource for printing papers that you use for your school? Is there anyone in Utah who knows about this mysterious printing service through the Tribune that I can use?

&#x200B;

I'm taking on the challenge of the school newspaper this year (the last two years they had a teacher who didn't care about structure, and students were printing libel and all sorts of things that caused the admin issues). So, outside of dealing with the students who think me trying to run a professional paper like a newspaper office is the worst thing ever, I'm struggling with printing needs.

I got some information from admin who paid for printing of the paper. However, I can't find that resource anywhere online. They said the previous teacher printed through Media One, however Media One doesn't have any newspaper printing online. The receipt they gave me said they printed through the Salt Lake Tribune (Utah), but I can't find anything on the SLT's website that indicates they print school newspapers, and I haven't been able to hunt down a contact number.

I found a completely different website for printing news, but I think you have to use their templates instead of uploading one of your own, but it's way cheaper than what they were paying before on previous receipts, and I want to save the school/district money (especially since they had huge boxes of papers left over from previous years).

I’ve been a teacher for about 5 years, but it wasn’t until about 2 years ago that I got into the public schools. It was an urban school, and I always thought working in that setting was my passion. I was wrong. I have a lot of past trauma and issues from my childhood (diagnosed with PTSD), and working at this district really unregulated me. 

I had kids in my face yelling at me, physical fights in my classroom all the time, rampant disrespect and verbal aggression, and I only got a tiny bit of support (for like 2 days) from admin after I had a breakdown in my AP’s office and told him I wasn’t sure I wanted to be a teacher anymore. 

I really liked my team, and one of them told me about this cyber school he was applying to. I looked into it with him and it honestly had nothing but positive marks. We both applied and got the job, so I just started there this week. Everyone has been so welcoming and kind and helpful, but I have so much anxiety about the change and the platforms I need to learn. 

I feel like I’m going to fail. It feels like I spent so much time managing behaviors and trying to put out fires at my old school that I don’t actually know how to teach.

Why do more schools not have a unique theme. I am trying to propose a margaritaville themed school for either a public or charter school.

Also have a sand pit with beach chairs and a volleyball net.

I get not everyone likes the tropical theme, but other schools could have their own theme. Plus maybe the margaritaville brand will sponsor the school and the kids will have loyalty to their brand when they grow up and stay at the resorts.

Each student will get a degree in tropical studies.

So in year 7 we went to assembly as always where we were handed either a red or blue piece of paper. If you got the blue piece of paper you were allowed to sit on chairs, eat sweets, watch the Simpsons and were treated super nicely by teachers. However, if you had a red piece of paper you were taken to a class room, sat on the floor and made to write out the school rules on a bit of A4 paper. Once finished the teacher would take the paper away, rip it up and make you do it again (this went on for 45 minutes to an hour). I remember one kid in the class started crying when the teacher threw their written out rules in the bin and shouted to sit back down and do it again. 

Eventually we returned back to the assembly hall in which we were taught about racism, the situation being made out to represent the discrimination faced by majority ethnic groups.

I suppose my hope is that the outcome will be the same, but I do worry that if I dislike it, I can’t fall back on that degree as easily? Does it matter? Is one path simpler than the other?

I said to a colleague, who is a primary school teacher,well I'll teach my students about empathy and how to foster it. She told me that if I taught something outside my subject, it was a waste of time.

It will be 19 years of working with kids though as I used to work with social workers helping home schooled children in foster care.

I have tried about 6 grades over the past 5 years and one thing is clear, I love language, math, I love to teach all of the arts...but I feel guilty that I love Grades 1-4 and can not relate to Kindergarten! I am not in the USA at this point, I am now in Canada and the programs for this grade are strict. The reason I feel sad is simple: they have a growing need for these areas where I am, will offer this grade to me and yet I can not relate to this at all. 

Over 30 years ago when I was in this grade, I felt lost. By the second month of school, my Kinder Teacher had to go on a mat leave and no other replacement was very good. I was not even treated well by the new Teacher! On the other hand, I feel like I have good moments in these classrooms and perhaps one day my feelings could change! I get super bored knowing I have to spend over an hour of my day helping the kids get dressed to go outside, help with shoes, monitor their behaviours while they play outside, it is just boring.

What I know I do love is teaching all the basics when they are older say 6 years old and we are all good. Can anyone here help me see beyond this scope? My friend is telling me I am very creative and I never get bored with other grades because I know how to spin the same subjects in new creative ways etc...She says it is just the needs that might overwhelm me.

I'm starting my 20th year teaching middle school math in a low-income school/district. I've fallen into a trap of how I present the material, and Im looking for different methods. For example, I start with bell work that is *supposed* to be done in a notebook. We'll then move into the lesson. This is presented on a SMART Notebook slide(s), and take notes on the notebook. Next we work through pages in the book that are also presented in Notebook. There are always going to be kids who will do 0%. I want to try something different to hopefully make it a bit better for the kids who are trying or are at least interested.

1692323936.0,I left as a volunteer teacher as I couldn’t control childrens’ behavior and the work was taxing.,"I am a prospective master’s student looking for volunteering work, and I found a potential volunteering opportunity with a primary school, for poor kids or kids who can’t get into public school. 

Me feeling obligated to help, decided to take it up and was given the oldest classroom. Most of the kids are 11, but some are a bit older at 15. Great opportunity, right? Wrong. 

Me lacking teacher training, and also prep work (I only come in once a week), I quickly found it very hard to control kids’ behaviour. They wouldn’t take me seriously. On top of that, they did not get regular classroom breaks. Because the facilities are not good, there’s no canteen or playground. They were stuck in the same room, only allowed to go outside for water, toilet or food. I essentially needed to teach them from 10am till 3:30pm with a small lunch break (they take the food and eat it in their classroom seats as well!).

After a few weeks of coming in, I decided today I wouldn’t come anymore. I don’t agree with the practice of not having regular playtime, on top of that there’s a lot of power tripping in the school and physical punishment (not uncommon in my country). 

From this experience I did learn that I enjoy teaching in small groups as a tutor, as I enjoyed checking each student and seeing their progress, helping them on an individual basis. But complete control over a classroom intimidates me. 

Just wanted to put this out there and ask for any words of advice. Knowing what I know now, I truly appreciate how difficult it is being a teacher. And I can’t imagine how hard it is for those lacking facilities and funding.

This is my first year teaching intensive ELA. My 7th grade students have all tested at least 3 grade levels behind on reading. Today was the first day or reading a short story. Some were engaged, I lost others at the word “read.” 

Here is what I am doing:
1. Reading aloud (I take volunteer students and I read some. I don’t like to make students read because it can be embarrassing) 
2. Frequent checks for comprehension (every paragraph or every few paragraphs)
3. Asking opinions on what is happening. 
4. Chunking texts and providing breaks to not overwhelm them. 
5. Providing visual aids and background knowledge as much as possible. 

I have no say in what story we read and cannot provide outside books/stories to the kids that they will find interesting. I also have no say in how long the story is; I have to read what is provided. The length often overwhelms them immediately. I don’t know what else to do to get and maintain their attention, or have them engage in answering questions.

I had a student come up to me late and I asked what their name was, looking at the seating chart. She stated that her dead name was on their and gave me her name. She still goes by she/her, it's just her name is something quite different. I accidentally indicated the automatic email instead of the counselor route, so I am just hoping and praying that she is on good terms with her parents so that I did not cause any traumatic event to occur.

It used to be the norm that the BLT members sought input from their grade level teachers and brought them to the meetings in order to make decisions, but that hasn’t happened in a long time. 

For example, the BLT team decided yesterday (school starts in 3 weeks) that students will no longer be assigned a personal Chromebook that they carry from class to class. This is to reduce damage. Instead, they will be assigned a Chromebook in each classroom somehow, and us teachers have to come up with systems to label them and ensure students are using the correct device. Not to mention procedures for retrieving them and returning them, wasting class time. 

I have suggested many things in the past to reduce damage/the effect that damage has on the district, like, you know, *actually* charging the families of kids who damage Chromebooks, especially when they did it deliberately or it was due to carelessness. Or at least charging a $15-25 insurance fee that they must pay before they can use the device. Of course that then begs the question - what if they can’t pay? Well - that should already be answered because when kids leave our building for the next 6 grades they are charged a $35 insurance fee for their school iPad, and these upper grades are almost entirely paperless including textbooks so it’s a necessity. Also, it’s not like we are in a low income area; we do have low income families, but we also have the highest concentration of millionaires in the state due to old money from the cotton and corn farms.

One left me a voice message that donations are not needed due to a church drive raising funds.

So, I applied a few weeks ago for a position in State B and got the job I have always wanted and accepted. My reasoning for looking at a different state was because of the significant pay increase. It’s an AU self-contained class. Plus, this state will pay almost 18k more dollars than where I’m at now. I told my new school I can’t start till mid November and they were fine with it. I plan on having my last day in state A at the end of October and starting in State B mid November. 

So….as part of state A’s breach of contract policy, one of the ways that a breach may be made is due to a “documented promotion” as defined by all of the folllowing: increase in job responsibilities, increase in prestige, reasonable increase in salary.”

I'm talking over 100 Ticonderoga pencils, 20 highlighters, 300 index cards, so many boxes of crayons (my fault, since I make crayon art), and more notebooks than I can count. Most of this stuff is personalized to our childish tastes, so we have erasers with cute animals and those notebooks with fancy little covers.

It did not occur to us that one semester in digital courses needed less materials than a full year (or 2 years, since that's what we are used to doing) of traditional courses. And some of these items also were gifts from our parents (also a miscommunication).

It's honestly such a waste to return them and I'm not struggling financially, and neither are our families, so we want to put them to good use. How does one normally go about this? I asked around and I was told teachers are always in need. I'm just worried since most of these items aren't standardized and my schools in the past only accepted standardized.

I’m scared my devotion to punk and love of body modding is going to stop me from getting a job as a teacher, my family says it will, my teachers and principal said they wish it wouldn’t have an effect but it likely will, and all my friends just say I’d be a cool teacher to have, but that doesn’t really help, so I’m now reaching out to the internet to ask for advice on this, do you think I could get a job teaching even with all of my tats and piercings?

Edit: After reading through the comments I think I should add some more info about my area and a little more about my appearance, I’m from central New York, I grew up in a very small hicktown and moved in between the same 3 small towns the 18 years I’ve been alive, a few years ago though I found a local music scene and fell in love with it, so I’d find a ride or drive about an hour to different cities to see all of the scenes, now that I’ve graduated I chose my favorite and picked a school in one of the cities, I plan on staying here hopefully for my life. As for my appearance I think a lot of people are getting some things mixed up, I do not have face tattoos, I have tattoos on my chest, back, legs, and a sleeve on my right arm that goes down to my knuckles. So the back of my hand has a tattoo that is visible, but I have no tattoos that go above my collar bones. For facial piercings I don’t have any on my lips or eyebrows, I have a septum and my right nostril pierced, I usually wear a piercing that’s got a chain that connects my right nostril to my ear.  My ears are gauged and the rest of my ears have piercings I have an industrial in my left ear and many more on the rest of my ears. Another thing I find important to mention is my hair, when a lot of you read punk I think you assumed I had a Mohawk or liberty spikes or a punk hairstyle of that type, while I used to, I just recently shaved my head and plan on keeping a shaved head for quite some time, my current look is closer to the 80s skinhead but my wardrobe is still full of punk clothes, a pair of homemade crust pants, and plenty of jackets covered in studs and patches. Of course I know when I go for an interview I won’t be wearing any of these, I do have some professional clothes to wear as well as smaller stud piercings so I can swap out my chain piercings and dangly earrings for just little black studs.",teaching

What kind of consequences do you give out? I'm not a fan of forcing missed recess. I was thinking about having them write out the whole alphabet upper and lowercase.

In 5th grade for Social Studies it's really easy to just assign group projects and let them work autonomously. It's also really easy to relate lectures to their own lives, as their ability to sit still is immensely better. How does one even begin to teach social studies in primary grades?

I hear it's a lot about transitions, any tips for transitions? I was thinking about getting a big visual timer displayed on the overhead and practicing how long it takes at the beginning of the year and working the times down.

Any organizational tips in getting the students to stay organized or having their work organized? Folders? Journals?

I had my 5th graders correct each other's math homework, any tips/shortcuts for grading 1st grade work? I even had ChatGPT grade essays, but I'll need a whole new system of grading/correcting.

1691109441.0,I don’t ever want to teach again.,"Throwaway because this is so specific.

I (20F) am an undergrad TA at a large research university - this summer semester was my third time being a chemistry TA. I started TAing as a freshman and am now a sophomore - still the youngest chemistry TA. The lectures are large - 2-3 sections (depending on the semester) of ~300 students each during fall and spring, and ~90 students for the summer.

Chemistry is my favorite class I’ve ever taken (the class i TA is general chemistry, a lower division class). The past fall and spring, I TAed gen chem 1 for the same professor, and this summer i TAed gen chem 2 also for the same professor. However, this was her first time teaching gen chem 2 and my first time TAing for it, so we all basically constructed this summer class from scratch. My end goal has been to become a professor on the teaching track, so I can educate our future scientists, doctors, etc, and do chemical education research on the side. I absolutely love teaching higher education. I’ve been told that I’m great at teaching/explaining the subject. In the fall and spring, I got great reviews from my students and professor I worked with. She has continued to request me as her TA every semester, including this coming fall. In fact, I also have been teaching multiple sections of a pedagogy class since this past spring, to teach others about student learning and how to effectively teach. Only I and one other undergrad in the entire university have this position.

This summer, however, I feel as though I did the worst job I’ve ever done out of all 3 of my semesters of TAing. A lot was definitely on me, as I do not remember gen chem 2 material anywhere near as well as I remember gen chem 1. I still reviewed the material/lecture slides and made the discussion worksheets/answer keys, to make sure I had a solid understanding of the material. I should’ve reviewed more though, as admittedly I sometimes had trouble answering student questions more than I anticipated. The funny part is, the students wrote great things about the worksheets, that they were helpful, not knowing I and two other TAs were the ones making them.

Additionally, there were definitely times that I wasn’t fully present. Obviously the students don’t know about any of this, but I was struggling with my mental health a lot. It took the entire summer to figure out the correct medications, and I actually attempted suicide at one point - over a weekend, then came to TA on Monday as if nothing happened. I, however, shouldn’t have let that affect the quality of my work. The students needed me and I should’ve stayed more professional. Maybe I should’ve taken the summer off? I really don’t know.

Although this was my worst semester, I have always been very passionate about teaching. I have had hundreds of students and can’t possibly remember all of them, but I still care about them a lot - I want them to succeed in the course and in future courses towards their degree. I can’t wait to see what they do after they graduate. I hope I’ve made a positive impact on them, no matter how small.

Now that this semester is over, though, I don’t think I ever want to teach again. The students have turned in their course feedback (NOT anonymous), and some of them had some not so nice things to say. Specifically, that we didn’t always know how to answer questions. Yes, we definitely should’ve reviewed the material more. But, some said they weren’t happy that we didn’t have certain equations memorized like the back of our hands. Thing is, neither do the students. On exams, they get formula sheets, as all of us TAs did when we took the class. The reason being, we care that students know HOW and WHEN to use the equations, not if they remember how to recite said equation.  Another issue is that one concept in particular was apparently taught to us inaccurately when we previously took this course (from different professors), so all we had to relearn it. One student in particular said that he was annoyed because I spoke too loudly when helping students solve problems in class. Sometimes the other undergrad TAs and I would whisper to each other during lecture about refreshing our knowledge of the material so we could help students better. However, we sometimes whispered too loudly to each other about unrelated things, which was unprofessional and 100% on us. Students wrote in the feedback that we were too loud, and rightfully so. I didn’t realize they could hear us from their seats since we were a distance away. Regardless, that’s on me.

I won’t deny that I should’ve done a much better job as an educator this summer. I should’ve acted more professional at times, and reviewed the material a little more thoroughly. But what kills me is that not a single one of the students let me know throughout the entire summer. I appreciate constructive criticism and if they have suggestions on how I can improve, I ask that they please tell me. Instead, all who had complaints waited until after the final exam today to express them. 

What breaks my heart the most is that as this was gen chem 2, I almost certainly will never teach these students again. There’s no chance for redemption. These students will forever remember that gen chem 2 was a class that negatively impacted their education. I care about all my students and I know that I failed them. I will have to live with this for the rest of my life. More important though is how the students feel, not me. They will maintain (and rightfully so), for the rest of their lives, that their undergrad gen chem 2 class was unenjoyable and unhelpful. I know that this was all my fault, and there’s nothing I can do to change that.

I don’t think it’s super likely that any of my students are reading this. But if any of you are here, I am so very sorry that I did not educate you well. I don’t know how to make it up to you, but I hope the rest of your undergrad career goes better than my class did.",teaching

1690908224.0,CA Preliminary Teacher License expiring Nov. of 2024.,"Hi everyone! As the title mentions my prelim. license will expire next year, I'm not young, I have my own kids at home.. I already had 1 extension on it. I've completed 1.5 year of the induction (btsa) program (3 semesters). I'm currently unemployed I had to resign from the district I was working for and will not have a recommendation letter from the Principal (long story, toxic admin. micromanaging. nip picking, favoritism). 
I haven't been able to apply to jobs because waiting on recommendation letters but people are on summer mode and are not checking emails, which I understand. 
 My question is, I don't know if to continue as a teacher or just go back to Subbing as I've done in the past. 
I worked so hard at this school, asked questions, did my best, reviewed my lesson plans at home bc didn't know when principal was going to walk in to observe. He would observe every 2 weeks at minimum. I tried to improve in classroom management. It was very challenging for me as 1sy year teacher but in my opinion and from the opinion of another observer from the district, I wasn't too bad.
Principal's style was very military imo so he wanted 1st graders walking in class from the library quietly, hands to the sides or behind their back, every head turned, watching me while I modeled a lesson. During an evaluation he said I didn't redirect a student that was biting the zipper from his jacket and another was playing with his pencil. This is just to give you an idea of how he was, there's lots more to say..

Returning to subbing may mean time is ticking on this credential. If I've already had and extension on this prelim. and it expires is that it for me as far as teaching or is there any other way to make it active in the future in case I want to finish the half year I need to complete induction? Or should I just finish the half yr of induction in another district? 
Also, do you think employers would notice on my resume if I just mention the district I worked for not the specific school and list the AP as the contact person instead of the principal?

Any advice is appreciated. My whole experience just really disappointed me and made me think maybe I'm not cut out to be a teacher, maybe my CM is that bad.. I don't know...Yet, I received many kind comments from half the parents in my class at the end of the year thanking me, telling me they'll never forget me, I was their child’s favorite teacher, I made a huge impact. Majority of kids were crying on their last day of school bc they said they weren't going to see me again... I am really confused.

1690895810.0,How do you teach middle schoolers about economics?,"Michigan Social Studies teacher here, teaching 7th-8th grade. Every spring we have state-wide testing in Social Studies for 8th graders. From what I gathered there are a lot of economics questions on there, ranging from concepts as simple as private/public goods to concepts such as NAFTA, tariffs, and different economic models.

Our 7th grade focuses on ancient->Reformation history and our 8th grade focuses on American civics and colonization->Reconstruction.

Apparently, the reason why they didn’t tell me sooner, is because the people they hired for certain positions, declined last minute. Now, almost all of the teachers in the school are in the difficult situation of teaching from 4th-9th grade. My subject is in something else entirely, but not that off from my first degree. 

I was about to say something about this to the admin, but I slowly learned that I was, among the teachers, making the most per hour. Also, of course, that we were all in the same boat. I feel bad for those teachers that their specialty is geared toward young kids and now are forced to teach to the older ones. 

They guaranteed that I would have support, through mentorship, assistance in lesson planning, etc. 

And honestly, the teachers has helped me so much; they provided me with their guides, books, and all that could help me. 

I am just panicking at the thought of starting with 6 grades as a first timer…is a lot. I also do professional singing for two choirs.

I guess this post is more of a vent…and any encouraging words of advice would be appreciated. 🥲

1690829494.0,First Year Teacher Lacking Support,"
TLDR: I’m taking over a position that’s been vacant for 4 years as a first year teacher and no one has been able to help me at all

Hello,

I am preparing for my first year teaching and have been getting frustrated with my lack of support just to prepare for the year. I teach Middle School Tech Ed in Virginia. My classes will be Intro to Tech 6th and Tech Systems 7/8

The school has a complete new admin team this year so the few folks I have talked to haven’t been able to help. I start new teacher orientation in august and I am worried I won’t have enough time to get ready. The position has been vacant for 4 years and they have been doing virtual learning to fill the void up until now. I have been given no resources, equipment, supply list or anything else yet.  We loved to block scheduling this year and no one has even been able to tell me if the first day of school is an even or odd day.

I was let in my room once to see the location and it is no where near my standards of what I would be comfortable teaching in. Books from other classes in the corner, a workout machine (why), old projects from 3 or 4 years ago, a lost and found box. It’s a mess. But during this time I was able to find a tote filled with pre packaged electronics kits and Lego robotics, the new principal was surprised to hear about these.

I was lucky enough to know another middle school tech Ed teacher who sent me all of their lessons and PowerPoints to build my course but still it doesn’t seem right. I have been working on these and my own lessons for a few weeks now but I worry about not having the entire course done by the start of class and it’s hard creating it from scratch as a first year teacher.

I’ve reached out to the CTE director to see if he could add me to a shared drive or link me with the other tech Ed teachers and never heard back. I spoke with some APs about coming to the building on my own to get somethings sorted out and they said , “I see no problem with that but I’m not sure how you will get in.the building is locked and I’m not coming in on my off days.”

So my question is what would you do if you had 10 years experience and were put in this situation? What tips do you have for me? Any recommendations on setting up my room as quickly as I can?",teaching

I'm 24 and graduated with my BS in 2021 then worked at a nonprofit in fundraising for 8 months (which is what my degree is in). I figured out I wanted to do something more people-focused so I used my previous childcare experience (summer camps, daycare, kindergarten TA) to get a job as a nanny. I now work with two families with infants, and I babysit for around 20 families of children ages 1-11 (but mostly 2-6). A lot of my work involves arts & crafts and the Montessori method.

I adore the kids I work with, but I've realized that long-term, I'd like to work in a group setting (classroom or nonprofit program), have my own space dedicated to the work, and implement a curriculum. I enjoy what I do because I love working with kids, I work relatively independently, and every day is something different.

I'm currently planning to get my associate's at our local community college but I'm not sure if I should do ECE or a transfer program for elementary education.

4. my ultimate goal is to be an Art Therapist. that's why I'm going back to school to finish 5 more courses for my B.A., then moving on to a master's program for art therapy.

5. I cannot legally teach *yet*, but I love being a teacher. I am also good at assistant/computer work, but again - I need something easy on the brain & stimulation of thoughts. 

some positions I can think of are

1690226021.0,Need a little help...," 

Hello there,

I'll just start saying I'm 24 years old and I started giving english lessons a few months ago to a friend of mine that knew 0 english and wanted to get into uni this year, she got accepted into english courses (which is the degree I'm also studying) and I'm afraid my job at teaching her hasn't been good enough.

Here in my country, Spain, your english skill levels are graded from a1 to C2 (a1 being the most basic level and C2 basically native level) I got a C1 certificate but I have to admit I learnt most of my english from videogames, reading in english, watching shows in english...the usual. I've always had a thing for languages and I feel like they are easy to learn, but when it comes to teaching I've realized people don't really have that much of an easy time getting a grasp on most things. (I'm not trying to be cocky, I'm just being honest pleasedon't attack me.)

I'm basically racing against the clock, uni courses will begin in basically a month and I don't feel like she has learnt enough to be able to understand lessons at uni level even if they are not that complex when it comes to vocabulary.

I give her lessons 3 times a week for 2h, I do it for free because I really want to help her and see her make it through and achieve her goals. But I feel really bad because even when I've been working a lot on how to teach her, I don't feel like she's improved a lot. She's gotten better that's for sure, now she can at least understand some english memes and small texts, but when it comes to talking and expressing herself it's not looking that great.

I've taught her a lot of vocabulary, made her write a few essays with help of the dictionary if needed, question particles, verbal tenses, read and translate texts to point out certain sentences like ""shake it off""...

I need help on improving my teaching skills. Anyone would be so kind to share their experiences and how it worked out for them?

Thanks in advance.",teaching

1689371399.0,How socially draining/demanding is teaching?,"Hey! 

For a little bit of context, I am 18 years old and autistic. I absolutely adore literature and grammar, and I'm considering pursuing a career in teaching Swedish (my native language) to high school students. Teaching is very appealing to me for several reasons, and I spend a lot of time helping friends and family with essays and other types of assignments. However, as I previously mentioned, I'm autistic, which makes social interaction very draining. Talking about something that interests me is energizing, at least at first, but I'm worried that having to talk to students all day will make me miserable in the long run. Of course, this is different for every individual, but I was wondering if anyone of you have had any similar experiences/concerns in your career? If so, how's it working out for you now?

1689322175.0,Linktree/link-in-bio alternative for teachers,"Do any teachers here use Linktree (or similar link-in-bio) tools in their classroom?

If so, how do you use them and why do you use them instead of simply sharing links through whatever classroom management software you use (e.g. Google Classroom, Canvas, Moodle).

I was thinking of creating a link-in-bio alternative specifically tailored to teachers sharing links with students.

Are there any complaints or pain points you have with these existing link-in-bio tools? Perhaps you would like some certain external integrations (kahoot?) or embedded applets (timers?) that are specific to teaching and so most other tools are missing.

Wakelet is the closest tool I have found to an education-specific Linktree, however it seems to be more focused on creating many static collections that can be published and shared via randomly generated links. I think there is value in having a single human-readable link that can be shared kahoot style (i.e. students can read it off the whiteboard).",teaching

1689313824.0,Career Advice - EdD?,"Hi all, 

I’m a 15 year veteran teacher here, hoping to find someone in the know who can offer some advice. 

I started my career at the university level, and I have a PhD, two MAs, and publications. Life happened, however, and I had to relocate and eventually transition into a secondary role to be closer to family. I love teaching, but I’m seriously looking into administrative roles in the near future. 

If I was still in the university system, I know I already have the credentials needed to get into administration. But at the secondary level, especially in California, there are a lot of rules and politics to all of this. Some districts more than others. 

Anyway, I know I don’t need an EdD to get an admin credential and land a gig, but what I am wondering is what doors, if any, would having an EdD open that a PhD wouldn’t? Is there any meaningful difference in opportunities that an EdD offers that a PhD wouldn’t? 

I’ve seen numerous threads where folks ask for advice about whether a PhD or EdD would better suit their career goals best, but my background doesn’t quite fit the situations for which those other questions seeking advice were asked. I want to work in secondary admin, and I understand an EdD is better suited for that purpose. However, I already have a doctorate so is attaining a second one helpful in any way for my career? 

So, I’d welcome any thoughts and advice from anyone who can chime in. Whether you are already in admin yourself, considered it but decided against it for whatever reason, or perhaps have had a similar path to my own. Thanks for reading!",teaching

1689189773.0,Infuriating Principal,"So I just went through a back and forth with a middle school principal and I’m still a little dizzy. 

Last month, I sent out a bunch of applications because I’m interested in working in a school district again. I used to be a paraprofessional so I applied for para jobs again and some office positions. One of the first interviews I lined up was a dual interview at a middle school for an ISS para and one of the vacant office clerk positions there. The interview was overall pleasant. Panel interview with the two assistant principals and the principal. They were nice but the principal got a little unprofessional and basically spent the second half of my interview talking about how we’re in a national teaching shortage and that this county has vacancies in every school and in every subject. She noticed I have a bachelor’s degree on my resume and I confirmed and she once again went on a rant about their county’s alternative teaching program and how badly they need teachers and that I should consider it. 

I’m actually quite interested in teaching so I expressed interest and she told me to contact HR. The APs tried to reign it in and ask their portion of questions but she interrupted both of them at points to ask me questions like “What subjects would I be interested in teaching?” Once she stopped doing that, the APs finished the interview and  that was that. I didn’t get the office clerk position but she did call me about the para job. She actually offered me the job! She asks me for my references and I give it to her…she tells me to expect a decision between today and tomorrow.

I just got an email saying she’s rescinding the offer. I don’t know what to think. My application was tight. These references are some of the best I’ve utilized and they always do me good. I’m kind of pissed but also kind of relieved. If this is how she runs things, I’m sure working there would’ve been an adventure. I’ve gotten a couple of other interviews so fingers crossed on those. Other than that, I think I’m just going to focus on getting a Masters. And when I start applying for jobs, avoid that school like the plague.",teaching

1689113425.0,I have 46 7-8 year old students that I need to teach reading to in 3 hours per week.,"I’d appreciate advice about how to deliver quality instruction given the groups are huge and the times are so tight!

How do I manage these numbers when I can’t do whole-class instruction? Should I be breaking the rules and giving whole-class ‘lessons’ to the 20 or so kids who are a similar level to save time? My reading planning is already so tight, I don’t know where I can trim the fat. Should I (seriously) be ‘becoming a YouTuber’ (read: putting up video lessons every alternate week for some groups)? My school has a strong expectation all the work is personalised, so a relevant video wouldn’t cut it but a video of me rephrasing a relevant video would. Our students have devices.

All the advice about large class sizes online tends to be for older age-groups that include a decent number of confident readers. It also tends to assume you have a classroom where you set the rules, rather than 46 students you are responsible for in a big barn-like space with plenty of other students (and other teachers who are also juggling big, complex classes) in it.

More Info: 
- We are in a Modern Learning Environment, so these children aren’t in a classroom with me where I can necessarily set whole-class routines. 
- They will be supervised doing independent work (that I set) when their group is not with me.
- There are only 3 hours per week where I can provide direct reading instruction. I spend the other hour allocated for reading supervising other students.
- They will come to me in five groups, because I split a group of 16 into two groups of eight. My largest reading group is 13.
- The group which needs the most help (4 students) needs to be seen every day.
- The class are reading at seven disparate reading levels.
- Although these are new groups, I know all the students.
- I am a normal classroom teacher and I already do reading sessions with additional small groups of students before school. 
- I do not have a teacher aide in the classroom.
- My students are almost all beginner readers — not particularly independent even when I want them to be.
- I always voice record instructions and provide visual examples for their work.

1689021275.0,Advice for double level classes,"(Posted this on r/Teachers but it got buried, so I'm also posting it here) 

I just finished grad school and my year-long student teaching placement in a 4th grade classroom in a large urban school in the US. I also just got a job as an English-speaking content teacher at the elementary level at a public school. The school follows the CLIL (content and language integrated learning) model of bilingual education and is in Europe. 

However, I recently learned that two of my classes will be double level classes, meaning that two grades are combined into one class due to logistics. One class will be 1st and 3rd graders (ages 6 and 8) and the other 3rd and 5th graders (ages 8 and 10). This kind of arrangement isn't uncommon in this country, though usually it is done with grades that are only one year apart (2nd and 3rd, for example, or 4th and 5th). I'm a little perplexed about how to orangize myself and teach, particularly with the 1st and 3rd graders. For example, math standards for these two ages are fairly different. I know all about differentiation, but how, realistically, do I do that? 

I will also be working with students ages 3-5, which is a group I have zero experience with. In the US, early education is usually a separate certification from elementary education, but these two certifications are grouped together in this country.

I \[M35\] currently have a full time position as a data scientist, but with a masters in physics and nanotechnology (and a phd in physics) and a life long passion/ambition of teaching, I have finally taken the plunge and will start teaching high school physics part time by August.

I am \*thrilled\* but also slightly nervous. It's a peculiar kind of job where you don't sit next to a mentor and ask which command to use / button to press / etc etc., you are just LIVE right then and there and 25-30 pupils stare at you. I love public speaking and explaining things and seeing the light go on, so I'm not super worried about that part.

But at the same time, this will be C level (in my country there is C, B, and A) which means that these pupils have specifically not elected to raise the level, i.e., they most likely aren't (by default) interested, just want to get through it, or outright have a fear/hatred of physics. I want to change that! I want to be that inspiring teaching we all wished we had, even if they aren't going to study it later or directly ""need"" it.

I'm here to ask about any tips in modern teaching styles, resources to become inspired by (im thinking Veritasium / VSauce / other big science channels), tips for capturing them and keeping motivation high for 60 -100 minutes at a time, like what sort of activities to break up a long class etc.

1688692968.0,Young Reader Regression - Parent seeking help / advice,"My daughter is going through a major regression this past school year with reading and I'm looking for advice on how to help.  It's leading to unbelievable frustration for me (M43), my wife (F45) and my reader (F10).

Background on my reader:
She was in her districts gifted program for ELA.  Up until the second half of this school year, she had always enjoyed reading and getting her to read independently was never an issue - she generally always had a book in hand or on her tablet and was an eager reader in general.  She was reading well above grade level (according to our school's librarian, who is a friend through Girlscouts, my wife is the Troop leader).

Background on what's changed:
Our elementary school is fairly small, 5 classes of 4th graders, 20 kids each.  The district does ""track"" the a ""beginner"", ""middle"" and ""top"" category, with the low and high ends having 20 kids each.  This tracking starts at 1st grade and my daughter was in the ""top"" grouping up until halfway through this year.  She started having more challenging books sent home with her, but nothing she couldn't handle.  She made it a point to look up words that she didn't understand or at least ask an adult for meaning of a word or phrase if she was having trouble.

Christmas break happened and it all fell appart.  Nothing substantial changed in her school or home schedule and all of a sudden every required book was half read and her ELA grades started dropping.  She started really struggling in her reading group and other readers in her grade that couldn't keep up with her all of a sudden were thriving.

The second half of the year was full of frustration and tears.  She's regressing to the point of hating the reading anything.  Classmates are passing her in all aspects of reading and her test scores had really suffered.  She even dreads going to her library class (formerly her favorite special class).  She's was removed from that ""top"" track class and moved down, which really hurt her confidence.

The worst part is that we (my wife and I) can't seem to do anything to help.  We've had conversations with teachers that go no-where, one conversation leading to a teacher telling me ""Well, it doesn't click for some kids"", which (for all teachers out there) was exactly the wrong thing to say to a frustrated parent.

Is it OK to let her walk away from reading? She's going into 5th grade, which seems like a pretty important time to lean into reading.  ELA is the only academic activity she's interested in before this year, she struggles a bit with math.  

Should we change classes or schools to try and get some mojo back?  Our issues with teachers at this school have been ongoing from last year. I don't know what to do if anything. We have other, private options in our area, but starting over for her seems like a hard thing to make new friends.  Social life is hard enough for Tween girls and adding to it seems like a bad idea.

Is it too soon for a tutor at 10?  It would be an option, but I'm worried that the answer here of ""More reading"" isn't the solution to ""My kid is hating reading"".

However, my mother, who is a school administrator herself, talked me out of it as there was a lot of additional struggles to teaching at the time (this was during the peak COVID era). I started taking more science classes in my undergrad, and I thought maybe I would want to be a doctor. I still got to help people in a meaningful way, but there was an added bonus of increased financial security. As a result, my family completely backed and motivated this decision, and I have been on a pre-med track ever since. I have racked up $68k in student loans (majority private loans) to go to school.

I am now just entirely lost on my options. I graduate after the upcoming fall semester (in January). I have reverted back to potentially wanting to get into teaching, but at this point, I have not completed any training or coursework in education.

I just hate being in this position that I have to tell her “hey, I may come back, I may not, and I have no idea yet so good luck!” It just seems like there is no good way or easy way to prepare for this possible change and put my school in a shitty position if we end up having to leave and they need to scramble to find a teacher to fill my spot. OR the fact that it’s like hey, you MIGHT have to think about me not being there and try to prepare for that, but also I might be coming back.

Okay, lots of word vomit. I guess I’m just looking for advice if anyone has been in this position, or suggestions about how to approach this. I HATE bring in this position as a people pleaser and victim of teacher guilt constantly.",teaching

1688582056.0,How to teach someone with abysmal amount of motivation?,"I am tutoring a 24 years old student with Asperger's syndrome and I am starting to believe I have reached my limits. He is attending a private school because in public school he was allegedly bullied both by teachers and students. He and his mother claim that caused him to ""have a meltdown"" and now has PTSD and bad memory. I don't know what to believe, as he seems to have enemies even among doctors and dentists and the family is into all kinds of conspiracy theories.

Anyway, we have like 5 months to prepare for a maths exam. While he agrees to learn he seems to have close to 0 motivation to pass it. Never before has a student openly told me he is lazy and has no desire to learn. Then with a lot of encouragement I get him to do the bare minimum so we can say we did something. If I tried to assert authority he would either completely shut off and give wrong answers on purpose or become agitated which is not my goal. I asked a tutor that taught him some other subject (literature) what the deal was and he said he hadn't been able to get him to remember 10 different authors and one of their works despite going through it every day for a month. He failed that test and now claims his memory is too bad and every lesson he tells me how he will self medicate by drinking some supplements from India. He and his parents are throwing away antidepressants he is supposed to be taking because ""he wasn't his true self when he was taking them"".

I feel bad because his mother keeps questioning my ""methods"". Yes he doesn't seem to learn shit but try teaching someone with an extremely defeatist attitude who convinced himself he can't learn. This is the first time I seem to be unable to teach someone enough to pass. I also feel bad for him because he lives in a bubble, that is guarded by his mother and finishing school should be the least of his problems at the moment as in the state he is currently in, there is 0% chance of him getting a job",teaching

1688568720.0,"Got fired over explaining a slang word that includes genitals, to a class of 15 yo students. Would you?","I just got fired from a gig I had in the weirdest and most stupid way.

I was teaching French to a class of teenagers from Cyprus on summer camp, whom I thought would be young university students originally, for a little less than 4 hours a day. Mind you, I haven't had taught teenagers for a while, and after only days I felt it quite draining mostly teaching like I would teach adults, with a few variations, so I had in mind to make it as entertaining as possible to keep their attention and not feel like everybody here would be wasting its time.

At one point while we were on to adjectives, someone mentions ""pain in the neck"" so I decide, out of the blue, to throw in some fun slang word (which is something I usually do with adults), which I genuinely thought they'd appreciate all the more as teenagers.

It's the verb ""to break balls"" (in French since I happen to teach that language) and as they ask me about what balls (i.e; the equivalent) is, I just tell them to google that themselves. It so happens that they get no 4g there whatsoever and some of them are asking me about it, and since I have the wifi on my phone, I decide to show them. NOT MY BALLS, literally the first pic that came up in Google images.

Next thing, break time comes in and so does the activity leader. She sees the word still written on the blackboard and overhears students talking about it, and within a few minutes the boss of the school and manager come to tell me that I'm fired.

Now some of you reading may think that I'm a creep, but I truly had no other intentions but to explain a word as it is, as inappropriate as it may sound. It was totally unconscious on my behalf, probably even bolstered by the fact I'd slept 3 hours on that night.

I'm quite confused by the situation, part of me understands because indeed it was risky as I didn't take into account the background of the students, but the other is dismayed as I just know that I had absolutely no bad intentions in mind.

I don't even care too much about the collaboration itself, although it does bum me out as it was quite solid prior to that. The worst is, this stupid shit could damage my reputation.

I guess for my own conscience, I'm interested in hearing what you think about it.

1688502229.0,My position was cut and I’m devastated,"Tl;dr- I was a elementary technology cluster teacher, and now I’ve been assigned to teach fifth grade, and I am extremely extremely upset about it

Part of me feels really guilty for whining about this when I’m lucky enough to have a job and everything, but there is a vent flair, so I’m just going to vent. I taught fourth grade for about 15 years and for the last few of those years I knew that I couldn’t be a classroom teacher forever because it was so hard and stressful so I started making plans to get out. I got a 48 credit Ed specialist degree in educational technology, and I switched schools to become a technology cluster teacher at a different elementary school. And I did that job for five years. 

I was pretty happy as a technology cluster! The kids loved me, I did tech support for everyone, the principal kept hiring these terrible college tech interns who didn’t know anything. and putting me in charge of training them, and I did my best. I set up a ticketing system for people to request tech support or printer ink resupplies, things like that. I created a school website, which is one of the goals the principal had when she first hired me.

But for this coming school year, our enrollment has dropped, and the principal only needs eight cluster positions. And she decided that tech is “not necessary” so she eliminated the position and assigned me to teach fifth grade. When I went to talk to her about it, she was very sympathetic, she knew how much I wanted to be a technology cluster and not a classroom teacher, but she also thinks that maybe we don’t even need a technology teacher, because the classroom teachers do so much technology in the classrooms already. This is not remotely true of course. Every period of the day for classroom teachers is micromanaged, every class on a grade does the same reading lesson, the same writing lesson, the same math lesson, the same read aloud pages in the same read aloud book. Every lesson is scripted, and you have to do it exactly as written, and none of it leaves any room for technology. All the classrooms do have laptops for each kid, which is a project I was in charge of over the last few years, deploying all these new laptops, getting rid of obsolete ones and making sure every classroom got what they needed. But the only time the classroom teachers use these laptops is for MAP testing at the beginning and end of the year. (Oh, as the tech teacher, I did all the trainings about MAP testing and taught everyone how to use the teacher console.)

I don’t want to be a fifth grade teacher!! I’m coming back from sabbatical this September, so I already have to be observed 4 times by my administration, but since they know I’m new to fifth grade they’re also gonna have the literacy and math coaches up my a$$ all year. It’s gonna be constant scrutiny, constant feedback and “helpful” criticism, all for a job that I feel nauseous about even doing. (I have nothing against fifth grade or my actual future class, they are great kids and the other fifth grade teachers are super nice.)

I’m just really devastated. I was going to come back from sabbatical and be a technology teacher for five more years and then retire. I was really looking forward to that. And now my plan is ruined. I’m so sad. I’m over here wishing that the elderly music teacher would just freaking retire or something already and free up a cluster position for me. (And she’s the nicest person and doesn’t deserve me sitting here ill-wishing her)

I'm just coming on here to ask for some advice. I'm a new grade who just started working in healthcare. There are two things I've always thought I enjoyed in my life career wise - a job in healthcare and a job in teaching. I've always been very interested in both and I spent many summers volunteering in summer camps and tutoring kids and I always enjoyed it. When it comes to healthcare, it was always something I was really interested in and loved learning about as well. I went to college and majored in biology and graduated a few years ago. While I was doing that I had the opportunity to take a teaching class for STEM majors where we got to put a few lessons together and teach at an elementary school for the semester. I really enjoyed that. My whole life my family has been hearing me talk about how I want to go into the medical field. I really thought I did, so I pursued an allied health career and really enjoyed the schooling for it, but I'm a month in and honestly I am miserable. The work life balance is good in the sense that we work 3 12 hours shifts a week, but 12 hour night shifts are so draining and working with such critical patients where you feel like you can't let your guard down for a seconds is knocking me down mentally. I hate it, to be honest. I'm planning on moving to a different city early next year, so my goal is to stick to this for the next few months and then leave. That has me thinking though, if this is something I've always wanted and I hate it now that I'm in it, what would I do next? Then the thought about teaching came up again. Teaching has always been something I've wanted to do but I haven't gotten much support to go into it from family members, who always pushed for healthcare. What scares me is that I might have this idea in my mind and then once I go into it it's not what I expect, just like what is happening in my current job. I know teaching is hard, it's stressful, there's little support and compensation for it, but I really do enjoy working with kids and have always enjoyed being in classrooms when I've had the opportunity for it. I could teach middle/high school science with my bachelors degree, or go back to school for an education degree, but I want to make sure it's something I will actually want to do and really be exposed to it.

Will substitute teaching help me? Should I volunteer somewhere? How can I get a little bit of insight to see it this is something I will actually want to do before switching careers completely?",teaching

1688313237.0,A potential new way to catch cheating with AI,"TL;DR - What if we scaled the oral conversation to combat cheating?  


Hi everyone! I'm a student at Stanford studying Computer Science and a researcher at the Stanford AI & Education Lab ([https://piechlab.stanford.edu/](https://piechlab.stanford.edu/))  


With the rise of generative AI, I've noticed that cheating is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, I don't believe that the solution to this problem is to surveil more. For one, AI detectors like DetectGPT just can't keep up, and never will. But more importantly, I think that shifting the focus from product to process and increasing meaningful touchpoints between a student and teacher is the key to cultivating greater trust – the true solution to cheating.  


Over the past few quarters at Stanford, I've been experimenting with using oral conversation as a way to uncover true student understanding. Incubated at the Stanford Piech Lab, I am developing Speak On It!, a tool that uses AI to create personalized conversational experiences for each of your students.Our AI reads a student's essay and simulates a conversation with them, asking specific follow-up questions that probe them and reveal their true conceptual understanding. We then compile these videos and send teachers a series of warnings and highlights, helping them identify crucial missteps without spending excessive time grading.  


As a researcher, I don't know what it's like to be a teacher. I don't enter the classroom everyday, trusted to empower and educate students. I know that the last few months have brought a lot of change to your workflows, but I would love to hear your perspective on this idea. Hopefully, it could be uniquely valuable for you and your class. If you would like to see our research, you can find our tool here: [https://sherpalabs.co/](https://sherpalabs.co/)

1688268200.0,One Room Schoolhouse teaching question,"Do you think you could have taught in one?

I had an aunt that taught in one starting in the 50's. She said her first year it was only 8 students and all girls. She lived with a family and a superintendent would visit about once a week to look at lesson plans. Three years later they consolidated all the 1 rooms into a regular school with bus service. Many teachers lost their jobs.

Here in Kansas the last one closed around 1996. In South Dakota the last one closed in 2010. That school called ""Sunshine School"" originally had 3 classrooms and teachers lived either at home or in a  trailer house parked on the grounds. At the end they were down to just 8 kids in just one room and 1 teacher.

Actually they are  a great concept. A students could learn at their own track so a kid could be doing 3rd grade math, 2nd grade reading, and 4th grade history. The schools are connected by computer for advanced classes. Kids could also learn from each other. Today at some museums they do historical reenactments where kids will go to a 1 room schoolhouse for a term.

1687991209.0,One Bad Day,"For flairs I said vent but help may be good as well.  I apologize if this is the wrong flair or subreddit for this.  I just feel like writing this out will help me feel a bit better.  So, I apologize for the long read ahead!

So, I worked for 6 months at a charter school.  I understand some love charter schools but I hated it.  I didn’t want a charter school.  It kind of just fell onto my lap.  And as extreme as it sounds, I think I am a tiny bit traumatized by my experience at this school.

At this school there were students who physically fought yet were never suspended.  Some even threw chairs at a teacher and nothing was done about it.  The teacher told me that herself.  There were teachers openly saying people were playing favorites, and some other things I don’t want to put here (let's just say the teacher's mental state would be questioned if the admin heard what some teachers said).  There were no actions to consequences (shocker I know) and even referrals were a joke to these students.  Also, let’s not forget the threats students make to teachers.

Oh, and I do not know if it matters but this school did not have a nurse or a guidance counselor.

I was also hired at a bad time.  Personally, I had a therapist (I suffer from anxiety and depression but overall do very well) who kept bailing on me so I had to break ties with her and finding a new therapist was not working at the time.  Also, the school lost a teacher due to her getting injured on the job (I was the one who basically replaced her).  There were 35 students in a single class.  I was doing third grade in a co-teacher setting.

So, not too long after I was hired, I was made aware of something very bad happening in my personal life.  I did not tell anyone what it was cause frankly, it was none of their business.  I was told to go home to take care of the situation.  I kept apologizing and admitting how embarrassed I was about the situation.  I also stopped crying until someone asked me what happened.  And admin kept telling me to stop apologizing and it happens to everyone.  I went back on Monday as if nothing happened.

About two weeks later, the principal wanted to meet with me.  I asked if I was in trouble and I was told I was not.  However, they spoke to me about what happened and I was mortified.  I was told it was okay, I was not in trouble, and it was all over now.  But this meeting said otherwise.  I couldn’t believe I was lied to.  Also, I understand people may see what I did as not okay, please do not put that in the comments.  It was a very bad experience for me that went deeper than this but no need to get into that.

After that meeting, I was scared at work.  Not scared physically but scared about everything else and being lied to.  I even started getting physically ill because of this.  I never knew if information I was getting from admin was correct or not.  That never happened anywhere else I worked.  I have never been so stressed or anxious that I felt sick at work or in life.  Luckily I’m not going back to that school.

I had many interviews this summer and two schools offered me a position.  I won’t get into the whole thing but I liked one more than the other.  The one I did not prefer called me and revoked their offer because I stupidly put the charter as a reference and then mention that one thing in January.  I did not want that school but it was still hurtful from both them and the charter.

I did a lot for that charter school.  I offered to take on jobs for people who were absent.  I administered the state test when another teacher couldn’t.  If I had to be out for a doctors appointment I made sure it was NOT on a day with testing or anything else important.  I comforted the students when there was a huge fire by the school and they were crying because it was in the direction of their home while other teachers told them to stop crying…twice!  I even comforted a student who was asking me if her mom was okay with my very little knowledge of pregnancy (her mom was 8 months pregnant) because her mom’s “hands got bigger and veins got smaller.”  They also told me they missed me when I was absent and asked who was going to take care of them when I was not there.  I also had students feel sad when I was teaching small group lessons and they did not want to leave my table when it was time to switch groups.  Clearly, I did something right.

It is a shame they took one bad day, lied to me about it, and used it against me.

So I called the other principal (the school I wanted to go to) to explain what happened and to be transparent.  She said it was not an issue and to just send a different reference.  She told me one reason she really wanted me was because of my empathetic nature and she told her APs and the grade level team about me.  They were very excited according to her.  So I will assume that whoever calls references will not call the charter school.  I just don’t want to be lied to again.  All I want is to forget my experience and restart at a new school, in a grade I actually think I will thrive in (Kindergarten), with what seems to be a half decent admin.

I want to make it clear that I usually showed a bubbly personality in front at the charter school.  If i was not bubbly I often looked ""neutral"" but not sad, like when I was grading tests.  I said good morning and smiled when they walked into the room.  I rewarded the kids with stickers in the morning based on the previous day's behavior.  Those kids loved that!  I made plenty of (appropriate) jokes with them.  They told me I was the ""best"" or ""funnest"" or ""nicest"" teacher they have had.    

The Charter school knew I was planning on leaving for many reasons and wished me luck and everything, then they destroy my luck.  Also before anyone asks, I did have a formal evaluation and I did perfectly fine on it.  There were also students who knew of me but were not in my class who wanted to say hi, give me hugs, and whatnot.  And I have a bunch of notes and drawings from those students I intend to keep.  It is not their fault that the admin there was awful.  I was not all that terrible.

And I get references do not check about that but it is sad one unfortunate event (basically) out of my control caused this.

The school who no longer wanted me did not give me a chance to explain my side of what happened.  I could have lied and said that never happened but I admitted to it.  If I knew that one day six months ago (again where I was lied to) would be that big of an issue I would have not put them as a reference.

And admin did ""hype up"" the situation from what I heard.  I just decided not to argue with the principal.

From the school that offered me Kindergarten, I received the onboarding packet, and information of what I need to do before the first day of school.  I guess I am just a bit nervous something will go south all because of 30 minutes back in January.  

Also I want to state I know not everyone is the same.  Some principals would have seen this as me being awful but others would have seen it as me being human.

So, again I just wanted to vent.  But if I could get some words of encouragement or even advice or tell me if you went through something similar that would be greatly appreciated!  If you made it to the end of this post, you are awesome! 😊",teaching

I sent out my resume Monday of this week and got a reply pretty quickly from the principal of the school asking if I could interview this week.

I responded first saying that I could do Friday and possibly Thursday. Today is Wednesday and I sent a follow up email. I have yet to get an email back. Is it possible I did something wrong or they found someone else already ? I feel super anxious. Any support would be appreciated

Update: got called in for an interview on Monday and was offered the job position. Apparently it’s been crazy on their end trying to staff positions. There’s another Spanish teaching position.

1687919303.0,Advice on moving after student teaching? Certification? LIFE!?,"Background: I am going to be student teaching in the Spring of 2024 in ~~the beautiful, land of the free~~ Florida. I have grown up here and for a while, I simply swallowed the reinforced pills that come with living in Florida. As I come to the close my arduous music education degree, I slowly realized that being in the bottom 5 states for teaching is not normal, especially when juxtaposed with the astronomical costs of living in major cities that even do have good supports (i.e, Orlando, where you MUST have a car and rent is kissing 2k even though your take-home is violently making out with 40k). I am coming from the state's (if not one of the nation's) strongest student music educator programs, and will be licensed to teach music in Florida.

Foreground: I am earnestly looking into teaching in Massachusetts, particularly Boston. I have done a lot of reading from accounts of teaching in Boston and the job potential, but I also keep in mind that people who post on Reddit aren't necessarily the strongest reflective population (including me). **I would appreciate any advice surrounding:**

* If I am licensed in Florida, do I need to retake all my certifications for Massachusetts? 
* Should I go to grad school in Boston, right after my undergrad, then teach? \[I am very interested in research and have minors in both Mathematics in Statistics.\]
* Does anyone have experience in relocating and job interviewing in different states during a Spring semester?
* How do teachers apply for apartments when they are in between their student teaching and their next job?
* In general, how do first-year teachers compete with more experienced teachers? What certificates or trainings can I do on my own that can help? I am fluent in French and plan to be fluent in Spanish by the time I graduate.
* What is it like teaching in the northeast? 

Curated placard outside of the painting: I would discuss these with my school, but they have a **strong** teach in Florida mentality and don't really want to help; even mentioning grad school to them prompts them to say to just continue my Master's at the same school. Their attitude makes sense, considering their reciprocal relationship with the state, but it limits students seeking opportunities elsewhere and closes off conversations that could be shaped with their knowledge. I digress.

I am currently a special education teacher in the Bronx. I ended the year with having to take a medical leave for my health. I don’t want to get deep into it but I have recently gotten a medication change and I feel brand new. I am no longer suicidal. I thought i was feeling this way because of the school environment (admin) but I was also battling my own demons in the side with my mom dying. I felt like I was thrown into a pit to teach and I felt like I wasn’t getting enough guidance this year. I felt blind going in. This was my first year teaching. Everything I learned in school was completely opposite of what they expected. I felt that admin did not like me very much. But I got an email with a roster showing where the teachers will be placed for the next school year and I was on it. I truly thought they would fire me because I have had a few medical emergencies throughout the year and they haven’t acted kindly to me. I know that’s against the law to fire someone over their disability. The only thing was that I wasn’t sent the email with the roster, I seem to have been left out. My friend just sent it to me. Do you think it was on purpose so I could get fired? Maybe I’m overthinking this. 

I also wanted to ask your opinion on a TA position I got that is closer to where I live and the school is my dream school to be a teacher at. Half pay though as my current teaching job. I am trying to move out and it’s tough with a TA salary. I heard it takes two years in the city to get back on Long Island. I am going on Thursday to the Bronx to pick up some of my things because I don’t want them to break during summer school when I’m away. 

What would you do? I feel like the medication change helped significantly as to where I am functioning again. I want to go but I’m unsure what to do. I write a pros and cons list and it’s still pretty hard. Take the TA position or go back to a “tough admin” school? Everyone at the school says the first year is the hardest because they don’t give much help. My friend has been teaching there for 3 years and she said it gets better. Please help and give me advice!

1687715960.0,Is it OK to write a joke on an exam as a teacher (as a reply to a joke from a student)?,"For one of the exercises on a (final!) exam that I gave my students, they had to complete the sentences with a personality trait. To make the exercise 'fun', I used the names of the students in my class.

For example: 'Lisa is very ........ She always helps others and she is a good friend.' The students had to fill in 'kind' or 'warm' or something like that.

One of the sentences was: 'Tom is always ............ He never cheats on exams.' One of my students (NOT Tom) wrote down 'honest', and next to the sentence he wrote down: 'I wouldn't agree with this.' (He meant it as a joke, because Tom is known to almost never be honest.)

The next sentence was a sentence with his own name: 'Bart is never ......................, he always pays attention in class.' The students had to fill in 'bored', but Bart wrote down something completely different AND there was a spelling mistake in his answer.

So as a reply (while correcting the exams), I wrote down, next to his sentence: 'I wouldn't agree with this either, haha :)'

Since I just started as a teacher, I don't know if it's appropriate to do things like this. Do you think these things are OK? Of course, I won't do these kind of things on every exam. I wrote 'haha' and a smiley face next to it, to make sure everyone knows it's a joke. I work at a school where people are not very strict, and we laugh a lot. But still, I'm a bit 'scared', because this is my first job as a teacher and this is my 'dream school'. I've always wanted to work here, because my colleagues are so kind and friendly. We are like a group of best friends together.

Just to clarify: I used fictional names in this post!

EDIT: I wrote the ""joke"" next to the ""Bart sentence"" (""Bart is never ......., he always pays attention in class"").

BAE in Social Studies Education

BAE in Middle School Education,

BA in Political Science,

BS in Biology,
Environmental Science Concentration

1687418011.0,Looking for teachers prospective as a student,"Hello,

Recently I completed my final exam in grade 12 physics and got a barley passing (58%) grade on the exam. Throughout the semester I have maintained an average of 90+% in unit exams, quizes, labs, and a review project.

My teacher likes to treat each grade as an experimental peice of evidence. Given that this final exam score is drastically lower than my average of every single other measured grade this semester I was wondering if it would be apprioate to ask the teacher if we could work something else as this will drop me quite significantly as well as I do not feel it acurely represents my understanding of the material. 

There are not really any excuses I can make other than I just preformed really bad on the final test but if you look at my scores all throughout the semester the lowest mark I got was 83% so with the idea of experimental values in mind this final exam must contain some level of uncertainty as it does not align with the rest of the dataset.

If anyone had any advice on this matter it would be greatly appriciated.

1687325656.0,Seriously not cut out for being an educator,"I’m doing a summer job in a camp and it has been a rather bad experience. At first, I was trying to make the most of it. The kids were the only reason that made it worth it. I always hated school structures even as a kid but the summer camp structure is even more depressing. All the moving and physical labor of setting up every day just took a toll on me. 
So many days I just felt so discouraged but the kids were so sweet that it made me stay. 

Staff was also really unhelpful and it just added to my stress. I never interacted with kids before so not knowing what to do in certain situations was just really frustrating. It’s a very physically demanding job and very thankless. No matter how much I assisted, it was never enough. I was always told of mistakes. Even if they were small and easily fixable. 

I expressed concerns for actual issues because I ended up caring a lot about my kids yet I was made to feel like the kids didn’t care about me so I should just move on to the next task. At that point it really hurt my feelings. On top of that I noticed today a bunch of my colleagues in a group just straight up gossiping about everyone. These colleagues are always in your business and act like the boss. They also are very insecure and put on a competitive show as if we are somehow going to get a raise? I hate the environment and I hate the way the program was designed. I learned that I love kids but I am not cut out for this environment. I’m mentally and physically drained.",teaching

I spend a lot of my free time reading teacher blogs and watching teacher YouTube videos. Other people are so talented and have such amazing ideas! There are often free resources included. I will also frequently look for free resources on TPT which leads me to checking out the storefronts of awesome creators who make great resources that I would love to use. I also enjoy reading professional articles and journals related to best practice in my content area. I have Amazon Wish Lists of items I would love to have in my classroom and a separate one for professional books I would love to read. They are both several hundreds of products long. My chrome Read Later bookmark folder is out of control. My Watch Later YouTube list is ridiculous.

I am not denying that it is a literal dopamine surge when I find something (especially something free!) that I would love to use in my classroom. Unfortunately it is always a rabbit hole. I try to keep my files organized, but it is just too much to stay on top of it all. I could be doing laundry or chores but one hour turns into five really quickly when I'm looking at school related content online.

I want to spend my time more wisely and to catch up on sorting on everything I have accumulated so far. I just keep catching myself reverting to scrolling for any free resource or idea that I would love to implement in my classroom. I know my urges to constantly get better and to learn from others are totally irrational and not being applied appropriately. It is just a neverending quest that has too many rabbit holes. Reading about strategies and ideas feels good and is easily justified (correctly or not) because in my mind I'm working on growing my professional practice. Finding free resources provides the same high as someone who gambles hitting the jackpot. Rationally I know it is a time sink and every day that I initiate anither download only make it worse on myself to ""dig out"" of all of these materials. Even if it was only 1 file at a time it would use up valuable time downloading and placing the file into the correct folder, but one file inevitably leads to 20. One video serves up 10 more. One article becomes a dozen. What a silly compulsive addiction!

I've tried substituting other hobbies like reading fiction or magazines or binging Netflix or baking. No matter what there is an ""itch"" in the back of my brain that says I've missed some great idea or info or file that would be perfect for me to use. I know that's not necessarily true, but it feels true and if I give in and check then wouldn't you know it, someone DID post something amazing on their blog, or there is a news article about education today, or someone made a video about how to create a digital resource that I know my kids would enjoy.

I myself am openly bisexual. I do not allow bigoted comments in my classroom. That doesn't change the fact that these kids are extremely misinformed about some very big topics. I held 3 lessons on the topic, tried to explain social constructs in a child-friendly way and what it means to be queer. I tried to present facts without judgement. Stuff like ""there are animals that maintain same-sex relationships"", ""many famous people are queer too"" etc.

Some of the kids were annoyed by this, some of them showed some interest. About 6 kids got so emotional, they tried to yell me down. It got to the point where one kid said ""be grateful for the fact that you are alive"", implying that I would be killed in a country that is less queer-friendly.

Honestly, I felt like crying. How the hell do I deal with this?

Many of the homophobic kids are quite religious, they fear the downfall of civilization because of queer people, they are disgusted by ""women with penises"" or ""men who fuck other men in the asshole.""

## Design Swap Activity:

* ~~Students create a simple design using the steps of the design process (Mentioned in the previous slides)~~
* Ask students to brainstorm an idea for their design using the brainstorming strategies we went over earlier
* Have students gather the materials they would need for their design
* Have the students fill out an outline paper for their design
   * Name
   * Two W’s (went over this earlier)
   * The How’s (went over this earlier)
   * Materials
   * Notes
* Initial Design Creation
   * Once they have gathered their ideas, have each student start working on their own design. They can use the layout pad or regular computer paper to create their initial design.
* Design Swap
   * After both students have made some progress on their designs (25 minutes I'm thinking? I'll have a timer on the board), initiate the first design swap. Each student will exchange their design with the other student.
* Continuation of Design
   * With the swapped designs, instruct each student to continue working on the design they received from their partner. They should build upon the existing design, adding their own creative elements, and making any desired modifications.
* Design Swap 2
   * Once they have further developed the designs, initiate the second design swap. Each student will exchange their design again, receiving back their initial design.
* Finalization and Refinement
   * With their original designs back, ask each student to review and refine their own design based on the changes and additions made by the other student. They can incorporate any interesting ideas or improvements they discovered during the design swap process.
* Discuss
   * Did you like the changes your partner made? 
   * How would you improve their design?
   * How could you have improved how you continued their design?

1687027185.0,Netflix but for schools.,"I support paying teachers better at private schools. Have all the parents pay a subscription-based tuition for each kid, where if their kid is good at History, they can pay for the advanced history subscription where the teacher is paid a little bit more and teaches beyond the bare basics. So for example, in basic history you would learn about the essentials -- the constitution, the founding fathers, etc. In the advanced history subscription you'd learn about more advanced stuff like how Canada was formed, how barrels were invented and other countries.

They should stop requiring a Master's for such an easy job. But do teachers really need to be making $50-60k? All they're doing is repeating things to children. Anybody who's been through primary school already knows all the stuff a teacher does.

1686983038.0,How do I make my students more involved in class?,"So it's been a year since I've been teaching college students. While I've been genuinely enjoying my job and all the responsibilities that come with it, the mixed reaction of students is something that I'm starting to get concerned about.

I usually use the blackboard as well as my self-made notes and PowerPoint presentations as my teaching materials. I make it a point that I try including examples that the students can relate with. 
Furthermore, as it was my first year, there have been times when I struggled with syllabus completion as the syllabus for technical subjects tends to be vast and at times we get carried away teaching concepts in depth.
For most of my classes, the responses I have received were really good considering it was my first year. The students were extremely open with me, and I could make out that they were engaged during my lectures and found it interesting. Furthermore, my rapport with students in these classes was excellent.
However, I cannot say the same about this one other class (this was an extremely technical subject). As this was my first year, I made it a point to revise all topics at the start of my lectures, which would take some 10 min from the 1 h 40 min lec. I also have been consistent in asking students at all times whether they've understood the concept, and I used to ask them questions regarding the same. If I feel that they got stuck at a certain topic, then I would go over the same again. For enhancing student engagement, I used to ask students to do some reading on topics that although were not thoroughly explained in the textbook, would help them in understanding the subject better. However, bearing a handful of students (only 4 or 5 to be honest), none of them seemed to actively prepare for the same. Moreover, owing to multiple lectures, this class used to be scheduled for 7 am. Several students stated this to be to early and ended up not attending whenever it was a morning lecture.
I took one mock test after completing a considerable chunk of the syllabus, however, only 1/4th of the entire strength turned up for the same.
Regarding this class, I have recently got subtle hints that the students were not comfortable with my subject overall. 
Upon some self-reflection, here are some points I feel I should be working in so that I can try to avoid any such issues for this academic year:

1. Owing to some recurring health and personal issues, I had to cancel 5-6 of my classes, which I would cover up later. However, I believe I should work on not repeating this behavior by taking good care of my mental and physical health.
2. Be more organized in terms of what all needs to be covered in class and plan my lecture more meticulously. I believe since this was my first year, I could have planned slightly better so as to manage my lecture timings well. Covering the syllabus in rush at the end would not really be helpful to students either way.
3. Maybe have one to one conversations with students so that they can freely tell me if there are any genuine issues that they could be facing. It could be that the students do have some constructive feedback to share, however may not be comfortable doing so in front of the entire class.

Please suggest if there's anything more I should be doing. I definitely need to improve as a teacher, that's for sure. However, I would appreciate some pointers that would help me here😅. Appreciate your time reading this.",teaching

Anyway, I have posted to 4 High School Business Education Teacher jobs in the past 3 weeks.  I like business and personal finance, and it would be a very good fit with my education and experience.  

After every application, I email the principal listed on the job requisition a letter of interest giving some information about me and include my resume, transcripts, Praxis score, etc. 

I haven't heard anything back.  No replies to my email and no follow-up.  In fact, one of the Business Education Jobs was pulled down, and put back up a few days later with a different requisition number.  I checked my portal, and it said I did not apply for this one, so I ""reapplied"".  All the jobs that I applied for (with the exception of the one I reapplied for are still open.  

School starts August 3rd, and we are experiencing a teacher shortage - like hundreds of open positions.

Something else that is kinda worrying me is that elementary schools in the same district are posting welcome messages on Facebook to teachers they are hiring.  But, I have not seen anything on the middle or high school level yet.  

Am I reading into this?  Do schools go the provisional certification as a last resort?  Or does this all just take time?  

 I am in the state of Alabama.  Thank you for your time and guidance.",teaching

1686718161.0,Pursuing Teaching Licensure After an Expunged Petit Theft Arrest (No Conviction),"TLDR; Am I wasting my time pursuing a teaching degree and will I be denied licensure if I was charged with a second degree misdemeanor for petit theft, even if I was never convicted, did diversion and had it expunged? 

Hello! I’m currently living in Florida and am 19 with my AA degree. I’m about to start an online WGU bachelor’s of science degree program in elementary education, then will take all the necessary steps to gain my licensure including student teaching and extensive testing. Being fingerprinted and having an FBI background check run is a huge part of this process, and for WGU I’ll need to gain licensure first in Utah (due to Florida being a reciprocity state and WGU being located in Utah), then in my home state of Florida through the DOE, and then do more background checks for any school districts in which I may apply for work. 
Over a year ago I made a big fuckup for which I am incredibly remorseful for, and shoplifted from a Walmart which landed me a Notice to Appear and I was charged with a second degree petit theft misdemeanor, but I was offered a pre-trial diversion program and never convicted of anything. 
Fast forward, I am now getting it expunged with a lawyer and the whole process should be wrapped up in ~6 months. I know that even with expungement, teaching associations can see my charge and arrest in a background check. According to all state sites, it is not a disqualifying offense due to the fact that it doesn’t involve children, violence, drugs, and I never had a conviction. I would really like to teach and my attorney wearily told me that the state is so desperate for teachers it likely won’t be a problem, but I am having doubts. If anyone has any similar experiences I would appreciate reassurance or guidance. If I am wasting my time and money pursuing teaching, I want to know now, not 2 years down the line when I’m rejected for licensure and have a completely null elementary education degree I’ve paid $15k for.

Edit to clarify:
1) please don’t come at me with comments about how students shouldn’t need to do public speaking, it is required by the school. I don’t get any input on the curriculum. 
2) please don’t come at me with possible accommodations for the non IEP student. The school assigned the time the presentation must be done, I can’t change the time/location/audience for a student without a documented accommodation. 
3) the IEP student is still doing a presentation, just with his para and caseworker instead of with his classmates and myself. 

(In the most recent case I have students doing a group presentation that is required by the school and I have one group of 3, the rest are all groups of 2. One student in the group of 3 would rather be working in a group of 3 with her friends, but she was placed in the group with the student who has an IEP because he is excused from the speaking component. When I told her it was because so-and-so wont be speaking and I wanted there to still be two speakers she said that she didn’t want to do the speaking either and kept pushing for a reason why one student could be excused from speaking but that she couldn’t.

1686662206.0,AIDA is a scam.,"Having completed the Applied Instructional Design Academy (AIDA,) I firmly believe it preys on teachers desperate to escape teaching. She spreads blatant lies. Here are a few so you don’t fall victim to them.

1. “The field is not saturated” - false. Everyone and their brother is trying to be an ID.
2. “There are so many jobs in ID, just pick your niche” - false. As of Spring 2023, there have been only an average of 1500 jobs per week in ID. Compare that to other similar fields, like learning and development with 30,000+ per week. However L&D often demands more skills you won’t get from AIDA (LMS experience, knowledge of Java script, html, etc…) Not to mention that with the extensive lay-offs, the first departments to go are usually the learning and training departments.
3. “You’ll be more prepared than someone with a Masters in ID, and hiring managers will see that” - false. Hiring managers still care more about a legit degree - even if it is more theory than application- than some no name “academy.” You will receive rejection letter after rejection letter stating you lack experience. 
4. “The average ID leaving AIDA makes $80,000 because they are better prepared than many working IDs” - false. Because you have no experience, you WILL only be considered for entry level positions. Entry level average is anywhere between $50,000-$70,000. You will likely be rejected from even entry level because you lack legit experience and they have never heard of AIDA. Those stupid badges mean NOTHING to the rest of the world.

The program is ridiculously overpriced. You can get legit college backed certificates now that are cheaper and actually accredited. I am ashamed to admit I wasted $6k+ (and the price for new “cohorts” is over $7k now!) and will still be heading back to the classroom.

Do some people get jobs? Yes. However, not many and they often have existing corporate experience. If you are considering AIDA, go find a legit program.",teaching

Last week they promoted and I have been having a hard time. I’m not sure if it’s the individual students I’m having a hard time seeing grow up, or if it’s just because it’s the first class I’ve sent off to high school. The hardest thing is I keep thinking “do these kids know how much they impacted my life? Do they know how important they are? Do they know I’m always rooting for them?…”. Then I’ll think “no worries, I’ll just tell them on Monday”. Except there is no Monday, and there is no after summer break because they are all moving on. I’m having a hard time accepting the fact that there are words left unspoken and whether or not they left middle school knowing I am proud of them. I’m excited for the new school year because I have also enjoyed working with the 7th (now 8th) graders, but I do worry about “living in the past”.

Maybe we think they make people violent or they are simply a waste of time. But they aren't. We must not confuse the content of a game with the medium of play. Some games can be violent, mind-numbing and addictive. But play itself is a very powerful positive tool, if used with care. What if we went ahead and applied these powers to real-world problems?

I enjoy my job. I love most of my immediate coworkers. I love my kids. I love most of my day to day. 

I the caveat is I dislike my boss and my admin. The best way to describe it is he is slimy. His hiring practices are questionable. His communication is terrible. He had not responded to an email of mine since April. 

He’s known for some pretty sleezy behavior. He’s been rumored to have slept with most of the former administrators. He was in a relationship with a teacher. He often hires young, under qualified, attractive females. He’s been known to tell others he was not renewing someone’s contract before he tells them. Or to not tell the individual at all, and just not renew them. The push behind applying came when he tried to get one of our teachers into an admin job that was one of the worst teachers I worked with. She would often try to skip out on work, show up late if at all, call the kids names among other things, including just a lack of reliability. 

My other reason for leaving is pay. I recently found out that I am barely making above what the minimum step in a public school would be.

Jerome, published in 1889, while working my way through classic works of literature...and instantly fell in love! This is the most humorous, heart-warming, informative, inspirational and, occasionally, insane book I've ever read, which tells the story of three men and their dog on a boating holiday across the River Thames in a skiff.

Unfortunately, while working my way through the text, I came across several words whose meaning have changed over time, several phrases that are no longer in current usage, historical facts and figures that are not commonly known, references to poems, books and songs that have long since been forgotten, and so on. I thought that this was a shame, so I annotated the text. But, I may have gone a bit too far in my annotations, which is why I call this the ULTRA-ANNOTATED EDITION.

I've published my ultra-annotated edition through Amazon/KDP. But, no matter how many e-mails I send to Amazon/KDP or online chats I have with them, they refuse to allow me ""Editor"" status and they have not linked the three editions (Kindle, paperback, hardcover) together properly so clicking those links takes you to someone else's book.  Grrr!!  

Because of this, I've uploaded a free PDF to archive.org.  Here's the link ==> https://archive.org/details/three-men-in-a-boat-ultra-annotated-edition.  Note that I give a more detailed explanation of my annotations there.

Now, it's your turn, gentle readers. As I mention on the archive.org page for the book, I am neither a scholar nor an academic. (With that said, I'm the nutcase who typed in thousands of mathematical formulas appearing in my Kindle/paperback edition of Leonhard Euler's ""Elements of Algebra"". Yep, that's me!) You may disagree with some of my annotations and, if so, I would like to hear from you.  If you find any errors, disagree with an annotation, would like me to include more annotations, etc., please let me know. The book's e-mail address appears on the ""NOTES ON THE ANNOTATED EDITION"" page. I'd like to have the book as clean as possible for the start of the school year this fall so that school children can download the ultra-annotated version sans errors for class and not have to purchase the book.

*Necessary context: Yesterday, I saw one of my freshman English students talking to a senior. Senior looked really creeped out and was, in my estimation, squirming to get away and freshman appeared to be bugging/harrassing him. So I asked my freshman why he was bugging the senior in a fun and playful manner. He and I started to walk towards his next class and he explained to me that they were friends and joking around. I said great, all good. Enjoy the rest of the day!


Now today, pop into my supervisors office towards the end of my lunch period (8th) to ask about a state test issue in a couple weeks. Bell rings to signal passing time and she tells me that the above Freshman's mom called the Superintendent of the district to complain about my ""harassing"" her son.

Run up to my class while waving off the Athletic Director who wants to talk about my team for next year.

Get up to my class as the bell is ringing (9th period) to get them settled to write their final exam research paper, get a student outside to finish a test, one student needs to go the bathroom, 2 need Chromebook chargers, another needs my iPhone charger, and the final one tells me a student is in the hallway hysterical in tears. (This is fairly common with this group, there are 5 or 6 who have fairly significant issues). Step out to check on her when she tells me, ""Mr. LingeringLonger, I think I might be pregnant.""

All I hear is the sound of a car screeching to a halt in my head. I have to take a breath. Calm her down. Get a teacher to cover me while I go down with her to the school psychologist. Turns out she had just been with the school social worker who sent her away because he had another group coming in. (WTF!) Go down to the psychologist, pass her a note (she was in a session) asking her what to do, she ends her session and passes her kid off to her intern. We sit for a minute before I go back up to my class alone and student stays with the psychologist.

I sit down, take a deep breath and then compose myself as 2 of her friends ask if she is ok. Reassure them in the most professional way, then put a big smile on my face as I pass out test results.

1686090358.0,I'm done. I'm free. I'm venting,"Wow, it's finally done. I need any and all of the cleansing vibes to release this pent up energy. From the year, and today.

Like, the job came through for what it was, but at this point, I am just watching this school crumble. Where to start... I will just talk about my current feelings of the school and how I'm feeling leaving.

&#x200B;

I left today quite distraught. For a SUPER long story short (My grandmother mentioned I should write it in a book), I was upset because I did ultimately enjoy my job, no matter how stressful it felt and how low my low points felt. I liked most of the people I worked with (sadly not really in my department.. music, which makes that hard).

However, today just felt so annoying.

I had put my notice in in March and ultimately satisfied with that decision. A couple things happened within the last month where I really felt that I could barter for a full time position. But that was not the case. I asked for an exit interview, and my Head of School scheduled it for today. On Zoom (11:30). I told them I needed to come in because I wanted to finish organization of the music library & needed to grab the rest of my belongings still.

There was this weird hesitancy of Why I would even need to come in.

We are at a new building. I don't have a key to get in. So I waited for someone who could get in. Fine.  The music office was locked (my stuff was there because I had no classroom, but plenty of music), so I needed to ask to be let in. No greeting from that person. I heard her mumbling, but I could not make any of it out, and I couldn't tell if it was about me.

My head of school literally asked ""Why are you here?"" like I didn't email her and tell her I needed my belongings. and she responded with ""you're not taking any music?"" Super fishy.

I then went to look for another teacher and then I ran into her again and she said ""what are you doing? Are you just staying here?"" like I didn't belong.

I just didn't get the vibe. Like.. I am still contracted until the 15th, but I feel I am trespassing. Honestly, I just set up some schedule-send emails, one basically saying ""I am cancelling the meeting. Thank you."" with the few thoughts I was going to discuss anyway. I didn't want to sit there with this 'shut out' feeling.

I had seen a couple of staff members I wanted to say goodbye too, and since I was already in a low place, I ended up crying when saying goodbye to some. Which I didn't want to do. I reacted involuntarily (It's some sort of trauma response that my sibling also has). I wanted to positively say goodbye.

I'm frustrated by it because it's not like I phoned it in these last three months. I worked hard. I was dedicated. I showed up (unlike some). I just felt like they already had washed their hands with me and they just didn't fucking care. I've never left any position (most being temporary anyway) where my supervisors shut me out. They all genuinely wished me luck. This school felt so much the opposite.

&#x200B;

Extra: It seems the culture of this school when a teacher leaves. I can only think of maybe... 3 teachers that didn't get dejected in some way.

My predecessor actually left on INCREDIBLY bad terms. She put in a two weeks notice and then slandered the school by name on social media (Students followed her accounts). This was all mid year. I got to clean up the pieces.

Other teachers to leave on bad terms for whatever reason: The Piano teacher, an English Teacher, 2 math teachers, a history teacher (kind of), a science teacher, two special ed teachers, our guidance counselor, our theater teacher most recently. That is 11 of about 15 staff members. We have a small staff of about 20 or so. Our art/french teacher last year was somewhat fishy, and it wasn't pleasant seeing her go.

I'm not necessarily leaving on bad terms, but today was definitely a thorn in my side, and it left a sour taste in my mouth. Though with my email, I think I definitely did not leave on a positive note. Maybe my fault there.

They locked me out of accounts almost immediately anyway (remember I'm supposed to contracted until about the 15th).

1685906593.0,"I've just had the hardest year of teaching, and I'm absolutely broken.","It sounds a little obnoxious, but I've got my dream job. I'm the Course Leader of a University course that's directly in my field of experience (10+ years of visual effects experience in film/TV). I studied on the exact same visual effects course in 2007, and after working in industry for 10 years, I always wanted to go back and teach that exact course in that exact building. I did, and it's been the best 5 years of my career. Up until September last year.

The course leader decided that he wanted to go back into industry, but also wanted to leave because of differences with the University. That left two of us teaching the course (25-ish per year group, 75 in total). It got worse; the studio that he now works at told him that they were after more artists. He then told my colleague about it, and - yup, you guessed it - my other colleague followed and went to the exact same place, leaving me on my own to teach the course from October.

At this point, I was made Course Leader by default. Obviously, I was the only one. I never wanted the course leader role, I don't care much for the administration of academia, I just love teaching. What followed was 8 months of hell, teaching twice the amount of hours that I'm allowed to teach (contact hours), marking every assessment by myself, teaching every module, running every open day, giving post-assessment feedback to every student after they hand in, organising all pitches, talks, presentations, the end-of-year show, all on top of the crazy course leader workload duties that is quite literally a job in itself. By Christmas, I ran out of lectures and simply had to make some up on the fly. It completely broke me.

To be fair, I had some HPL (hourly paid lecturer) staff come in to help here and there. They helped with the odd bit of marking and teaching, and the ones that did help were utterly fantastic, but it wasn't nearly enough to cover what the course needed to have, and what I needed too. This Friday just gone was the last day of term and we had our end of year show that I had to organise too - that's all of the displays showing students work designed for interactivity, editing a student showreel, discussing with the venue and organising the bookings, and so on.

The evening was a success. The students loved it, we all had a great time. It was an emotional one as the students all got together and gave me a speech on how they really appreciated me sticking around, fighting through it and standing by them throughout the year, quoting ""we wouldn't have a degree if it wasn't for you, so thank you"". I had to try so hard not to cry in front of them. It was about midnight by the time the event was packed up and all equipment returned to the University, and on the drive home I pretty much gave into my emotions.

I'm a very positive person and try to look for the positives in every thing I see. But I've now got serious anxiety and trust issues. It was my wife's birthday weekend this weekend, I'm going to the Le Mans 24h in a few days time, and we have a beautiful home. I should feel fine, but I constantly feel like the world is ending. Half of me wants to write my resignation; work on my showreel and go back into the film/TV industry. But nights like Friday reminded me why I do this job; for the love of teaching.

It's worth noting at this point that the University (who will remain anonymous) are doing everything they can do support me. They've been great; the job advert is live for a new lecturer and they throwed more budget than the course had to bring people in to help. It's just circumstancial, and not the doing of the faculty in any way. I'm hoping that someone applies for the job that I trust. If they don't by September, I'll be leaving. I don't ever want to, and that would be an overwhelmingly upsetting day as it would feel like I'm being forced to leave my home, but I've always stood by the notion that nothing in this life is worth your health, and whatever you do, be happy. That's always number one, and while it would kill me leaving my dream job, I would for my health and sanity. I won't be doing this again if no one's on board by September, and the University knows that. There's some interest in the job advert, but we'll just have to wait and see.

So that's pretty much where I am at the moment, waiting for someone to come on board to bring the course back to where it was. My wife has been so kind and supportive with me while I've been going through it all, but it's also not fair on her when I physically can't answer why I don't want to go out on a beautiful sunny day.  I'm not really sure why I'm writing all of this; I don't think there's going to be a magic bullet that would fix it, I think I just needed to spare my wife's ears from my feelings (even though she'd tell me that she's always there to hear) and to tell someone else. But if there's a slim chance that someone knows what I can do to feel myself again, and not a nervous and anxious tit, that would be lovely to hear.

I teach upper grades now for grade school in a very large district.

During the spring some not so nice person I never figured out anonymously sent out physical envelopes to the parent did all all my students stating I have bipolar disorder. Guessing the person discovered my published poetry on the subject. Never found out how this person got the addresses.

I teach summer school this year and last as a first grade teacher. Not the norm to be placed in a different level but I’m guessing it is because so many higher ups partake and help with summer school I think they were impressed with how I did.

Anyways, feels strange that everyone higher up seems to know exactly who I am in a gigantic district. Probably from them seeing me in summer school and the word the must have went around when those letters got sent out.

Now they know there is this quiet teacher nobody knew much about who is an actual published author, has bipolar and has discussed topics related to it in published poetry, and I  wouldn’t be surprised if they got intrigued to find out before getting this job in my district I was spending years all over China working.

I also learned how much male teachers are needed, especially at the elementary level. I also am so excited to be a dad when the time comes.

My favorite part about the job will be the security, the kids, and being on the same schedule as my future kids! I also love the variety. I am someone who loves lots of stimulation while working and figuring out how to solve problems. The fact that every day is a different set of challenges doesn't freak me out. I love optimizing and finding new ways to do things.

I really haven't been able to make up my mind on whether or not I want to enter the teaching world again... PLEASE HELP

A little background of my teaching experience - 
Bachelors in Educational Studies (not certified). I've been a paraprofessional for grades K-2nd and helped with IEPs for individual 6-8th grade students. I taught English online to students in China for almost two years (ages 4-12 years old). I did some tutoring and assisted parents with their homeschooling during covid. I tried being a kindergarten teacher once in the US and it was super stressful. First time having panic attacks. I quit maybe 2 weeks after. Also, I now know that isn't the age group I want or like to work with. I've also attempted to be a ESL high school teacher and while I loved my students, I also left shortly after the start of the school year as I couldn't deal with the lack of expectations the school had as well as not having any of the support I really needed as a first year teacher in the classroom. I had to create all my lessons from complete scratch and find my own materials to teach. I felt like I was failing the kids and all the principal cared about was that ""as long as the kids like you"". 

Now initially I pursued education so that I could teach abroad and experience living in different countries but that ended up not happening as I found love, got married, and now I'm living in the USA (for now). 

I am now working as an school service rep - basically customer service, for a photography company that does all the photo things for the school districts where I live (8th grade promotion, fall pictures, spring pictures, class photos, staff IDs, sports, yearbook, etc.)
While this job sounded like it'd be fun and a unique opportunity, it's been the most boring and unfulfilling job I have ever had. My responsibilities are 0 to none. I really don't know why they hired me... 

Anyways that's my background with teaching. Never really done full classroom teaching for more than a month.

I got offered a 4th grade teaching position at a charter school. I actually applied for middle school English teacher but they felt (along with another school I interviewed for) that my personality and experience was better suited for 4-5th grade. 

I am just so terrified. Terrified that the stress will be too much and that I won't have any work-life balance. I don't want to quit on the kids this time. No matter what. But I may have some undiagnosed adhd as I deal with a lot of anxiety over perfectionism and I just break down easily when I feel like I'm not doing well... Granted the interview process I had with this school went really well. I don't have to write lessons plans, which is what I want. That takes a lot of the heavy load off my shoulders. They have a lot of professional development that I would get to do. Their coaching method (which I learned about and got to role-play during my interview) seems like it could really teach me how to be a better teacher... but I know it's going to be crazy hard and honestly, I just don't know if I'll be able to cope with the workload. 

But I want to do something worthwhile. I could be making a difference for one kid... Or I could just be ruining their chances of success moving forward. 

I don't know what to do... I also don't have much other skills or idea of what other jobs I'd like to do. I don't think I'm great at teaching but I think it's the only thing I have going for me.

1685380472.0,Respect : Obedience :: Relationships : Authority,"It seems that many teachers understand ""respect"" as something required from students and behaviorally respect is understood as a synonym for ""obedience"". Additionally, it seems that many teachers understand their authority as declared (not needing to be earned or justified) and unassailable. But it also seems that the reality of our classrooms is showing us empirically that these assumptions aren't useful, if they ever where. 

In my experience (17 yrs), pedagogy built on a foundation of declared authority and demanded respect is fundamentally ineffective. The more I reject my declared authority the deeper I am able to get students to engage in a learning environment, the more I am able to get them to reflect on their place in the world and the fewer power struggles I have with them.

EDIT
Thank you everyone for your engagement. Here is what I learned.

IMHO
Practicing obedience is practicing dependence and subservience. Learning to make choices is what Education is for. Content (Math, English, Science, Art... ) is the context of education not the purpose of Education. Students need to practice making decisions within a community of care and practicing involves getting it wrong and receiving feedback they can internalize and use to get better. Responding to authority is nuanced and requires reflection and an understanding

There seems to be an assumption that the students that are the most challenging will not be in positions of authority in their future. This is a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is how Education works to suppress social mobility. If a challenging students chooses to be obedient they will become dependent on authority. If that student is in a position of authority in their future they will demand obedience because that is what they learned.

And a question: How have we come to the position that we have? We are products of our experiences. As teachers we can assume authority. How did we learn to wield it. Were we taught to be obedient or did we have experiences of authority wielded in a community of care?",teaching
1685369301.0,To switch schools or not,"I’m an 2nd year ECSE teacher. I’ve worked at the same school the last two years. I started applying for other schools/positions for the following year, and I was offered a kindergarten position at a different school. I have until Tuesday to decide, and I am actually making myself sick over the decision.

Main reasons I wanted to switch schools originally:
- Preschool is not respected at my current school
- Principal has minimal knowledge of early childhood
- It’s a smaller school, two teachers per grade level, and there is a decent amount of gossip, drama, and a general negative vibe
- We get minimal support from district for special education
- I could feel myself getting burnt out and impatient this year. Felt much more negative than usual.

Things that excite me about the kindergarten job offer:
- I’ve always wanted to teach kindergarten
- The team that interviewed me was very open and welcoming 
- I’ve heard great things about the principal 
- More to learn (I love learning!)
- I feel like I’ll actually get to TEACH, rather than spend half of my time in meetings/doing paperwork

Reasons I am now thinking maybe I should just stay where I’m at:
- 80% of my current students will be returning to pre-k next school year, and the thought of leaving them/not seeing them off to kindergarten breaks my heart.
- I already know the curriculum, have my things prepped, etc. it would be much easier to stay.
- I absolutely love my para and partner teacher. If I leave, my para has shared that she will be leaving, too.
- I don’t do well with change, good or bad, and I know my sentimental side will miss this school and I’ll be an emotional wreck for the next few weeks.

1685255722.0,"(American) Teachers of reddit, what do YOU think society must do to value and change our education system today?","America has fallen behind greatly in education. I'm not a teacher (junior in HS), but one thing that really worries me is that America now has an entire generation of students who, in the grand-scheme of things, are more uneducated and very un-competitive in a global market due to a lower quality of education compared to the rest of the world. This might be unrealistic, but I worry that this issue will catch up to our society and overall hurt the US as a whole. 

While there are a multitude of factors contributing to this issue, I think one of the sole reasons is because Americans, in general, under-value education compared to the rest of the world. American culture has issues with anti-intellectualism, and I think that this is both a contributor to and a result of the widespread apathy and general disregard for education and studying (especially for the K-12 levels of education). 

We are rich enough as a nation to fix issues of funding (although bc of politics that will be incredibly hard to accomplish), but re-defining our cultural attitudes towards education might take decades. Additionally, some of Americas core social/cultural values (such as individuality, freedom), a direct opposition to uniformity, may result in a lot of social push back for any change that empowers the authority of teachers and experts. Parents are apathetic, students are apathetic and are not given responsibility. Overall, a teacher can be amazing, but a population of students who refuses to learn, study, apply their knowledge, and advance their education will render the efforts of that teacher useless. A parent who isn't taking an active role in the education of their child, especially of a child who is having difficulty or needs discipline, causes just as much damage. Some care, work hard, and thrive, but apathy is more widespread, curriculums have been made easier and pale in comparison to the curriculums outside of the US, so even the best of the best aren't really being empowered to their full extent bc of our system.

Overall, it's a pretty bad situation over here. We shouldn't accept the bare minimum. In my opinion, in our increasingly competitive global market and world, the bare minimum of things will not suffice. For now, we are ok, but other nations are catching up quickly because the people of their nations are empowered by education and hard-work. If we do not fix this, I believe that we will soon fall behind and our powerful status as a nation will severely diminish as we are outcompeted (ex. Korea was able to go from one of the poorest nations in the world, to an incredibly rich and advanced society. Why? Because of education, they understood a societies success correlates directly to their education and  dove headfirst into it. It worked, and now, they are renowned for their innovations in technology and science. Use this logic in reverse, America, a global power, fading away due to an inability to remain competitive, low quality education, and an ignorant populace). 

This isn't me saying that Americans are dumb, nor me trying to conflate this issue. We might be more insular and ignorant, but we have every ability to reverse that. I believe that we are smart people but our systems just don't empower that, and we do not empower ourselves most importantly!!! Yes, we have incredible institutions and innovators, but those are not the majority. They cannot carry this nation, we all must.

As educators with experience in the system, what do you think must be done to fix this? How can we re-define our culture to emphasize and cherish education as seen by other nations? Policy changes/radical movements/government funding/national standardization of education (this literally sounds impossible tbh since states control education but idk)? Please give me all your thoughts, your voices are incredibly valuable! Thank you!!!!!",teaching
1685242686.0,How Honest to Be When Changing Schools,"I work at a small private school and, after years of struggling with my current principal, I accepted a job elsewhere for September. I hate to leave, and I work in a program where you keep children in your class for 3-4 years— so saying goodbye is particularly hard. I love these children and their families and feel very close to many of them. (And at the risk of sounding arrogant, I have a great rep with parents and students). 

I gave my boss several months notice and hoped they’d announce the staff changes sooner rather than later but, of course, they didn’t (the priority is collecting tuition down payments and they didn’t want people to know before that— I have notoriously good re-enrolment stats). I wasn’t explicitly told not to tell parents but I held off for months, thinking it was the professional thing to do (while also feeling horribly guilty that people were reenrolling without the staffing information). 

In recent weeks a few parents asked me if I’d be returning and I began answering honestly. Word has now spread. 

Parents are furious at the principal for withholding the information and I’ve been hit with a barrage or emails asking me why I am leaving, telling me they only signed up because they thought I’d be teaching their child, and asking if they should keep their children enrolled at the school. (Two families have even found out where I’m going and transferred their kids 😬). 

This is my first school and the first time I’ve left (after 8 years) and I don’t know what to do. 

The kids and their families are my priority. I care about them and I’ve always prided myself on being honest. Our principal IS a terrible person and manager, and several teachers are fleeing because of her. She’s hiring unqualified yes-men in our place. I can see the school going downhill and I wouldn’t advise people to stay. 

But it’s a small community and I also don’t want to get a reputation for “gossiping” or being unprofessional (or whatever my boss might accuse me of). 

I truly don’t know if I should play it safe and say nothing to the people I care about, or share a carefully worded version of the truth about what has been going on at the school so that they can find a better place for their children.

First time teaching English as a foreign language to kindergarten students for 2 hours per week.

1685114077.0,End of the year thoughts," 

Well folks, many of us have made it to the end of the year (or are close to it).

Reflecting on the year that has past, there are a lot of aspects that continually come to mind.

1. Children will be children. They can be resilient but they do have a hard time bouncing back from the darkness in our society. From the politics to the numerous schools in the news to the violence inside the school, our students are faced with serious things that they really should not be. They can bounce back, but they are never given the chance to do so. They are constantly bludgeoned with the negative and when the only rays of light come from us it can be exhausting. We try to be that positive in their lives so they can thrive and succeed, but it is difficult to fight their darkness back while trying to do the for ourselves. We will succeed though.
2. We are tired. We are drained. THis year has been difficult. To those that leave, I understand. It has been brutal. For those that are staying, we know that we need the break to be able to seriously recharge our lives and spirit. We will come into next school year opptimistic yet cautious. THis is understandable as well. The aggression toward teachers and school personnel is at an all-time high, and we are nervous. We will succeed though.
3. IS it going to get worse? that is the question we are all asking ourselves. My opinion is that next year will be equally as difficult as this year has been. There will be more divisive rhetoric coming out against teachers and what we do. We will weather that storm however. We will be able to know that the students are reflecting what thye see outside our classrooms and we will stand tall and continue to be that guiding light for them to hopefully emulate. Again, it is going to be difficult. We will succeed though.
4. We will going to still have to fight to have our voices heard. Well will have to scream sanity at the top of our lungs to beat back those that are trying to politicize education. The society that tells us we are a danger to their children but should carry guns to protect them will continue to yell and scream atr School Board meetings. We will still those angry parents throwing accusations at us for being human. We will stand tall and know we are doing right by the student. We will continue to educate our students with facts, reasoning, and caring. We will help them grow no matter what happens. We will succeed though.

What I am going to say is this: This year has been difficult. Next year might be just as difficult. BUT if we stay the course and care for our students. Give them a chance to grow and thrive, we will be rewarded. Not by society but by the students we serve. Those students will remember us and continue to grow. THose students, whose life we have toucvhed, will be better for being in our classroom.

Our career and our calling is to educate those in our society that need the best people our community has. We are NOT the bottom of the ladder, nor are we the top of the ladder....we are the ENTIRE ladder that helps every community, society, and individual climb to success. Never forget how strong we are as individuals and as a group.

We will continue to succeed!",teaching

Struggled with discipline. I would have violent students who were not disciplined as contractually obligated by my district and union. Was not receiving contractual required written statement to actions taken by admin, some and mail were never processed.

In the middle of the year I brought this to the attention of my union.

They informed her to make sure to process referrals.


This year I brought up via email my concerns they referrals were not processed. She claimed I marked the referral as within the classroom as opposed to discipline which would require her to address—classroom referral only used to show I document it and handled it myself. I shifted through emails and could find my concerns previously they she forgot I mentioned the same unaddressed referral and how none ever were addressed before with a student I had. I struggled a lot with this student. I could see in the email before I did not mark it as she claimed and could prove it for another referral in email. Which proved she changed all process referrals to hide she did not take contractual required actions repeated.

Had a meeting and she denied it until I showed my proof.  She finally admitted and asked what I wanted. I don’t know what to feel or thank now but my union is currently aware.

1685059149.0,I did not think another teacher would be the biggest problem in a long term sub gig,"Guys I can’t with this craziness.  I taught hs from 2008-2016 and then I moved to college.  Being a college professor pays garbage.  So since my college year was done April 26, I took a long term sub maternity coverage in my content area (family and consumer science) until the end of the school year to test the waters and see if I wanted to go back to Hs for the better pay.

I can say I prefer hs to college because I have a very small group of college students so the three or four that I have that just absolutely suck stand out way more.  I like the shorter classes and I can say that 90% of the students I have in this coverage are genuinely nice students.  We’re getting along great and not because I’m just letting them sit there and do nothing, we are getting through the curriculum and they are doing very well.

But holy crap, I share a classroom with one of the nastiest people I have ever met in my life.  Every. Single. Day…she chastises me over something wrong in the classroom.  Mostly about things not being put back in the right place, or don’t touch this or that.  For reference we teach child development with a preschool class 2x a week, so the class room is half a classroom and other half a room fit for preschoolers with a fridge, sink and stove.

Most of her issues center around cleanliness, which to me is comical because I come in for the second half of the day and the classroom is wrecked.  I am diagnosed with OCD and anxiety and mess makes me crazy, so I wipe all the gross preschooler food off the tables and put away any thing out of place.  My class at the end of the day has the drill down that everything gets wiped down and all supplies go back to their home.  I’m the teacher that everything on my desk is at a perfect 90 degree angle.  So for her to be yelling at me about mess is rediculous.

Last Monday, I was t-boned 2 streets over from the school.  Everyone was fine, but shaken up of course.  I couldn’t go in because my car was not drivable.  On Tuesday I felt like crap, I was super sore and upset that my car may be totaled.  I walk in and get a total dressing down about things left out the day before, such a mess blah blah blah…all in front of students!  She has a select group of favorites that she will do the mean girl whisper and laugh and then look at you which on a professional level makes me want to bang my head against a wall.  

Yesterday I had a class of level 2 students, and only 7 were in school because it was prom.  One student asked if she could sit in front of the teacher desktop in the class with her own laptop because she felt like she could focus better there.  It is sorta tucked away and she’s a good kid, I have no reason to say no (there is no confidential info and the desktop was signed out of).  My class had such a nice vibe, the students are working on the year end research papers and we had super nanny playing on the projector.  The other teacher comes in and when she notices my student witting at the teachers station she starts interrogating her about why she is sitting there and not at a desk.  I intervened and said I gave her permission to sit there and she was using her own laptop.  After she left all the students were upset.

Today I let a student have part of her lunch because she missed lunch due to testing and she flipped out about how there is no eating allowed in the room (even though we have preschoolers having lunch in the room 2x a week??) because we have mice.  I just sorta stare at her at this point.

The supervisor has apologized for her behavior on numerous occasions to me and I finally told her it’s not ok.  I know I’m a passing vessel, but if that had been a brand new teacher in that roll, they would quit thinking teaching just equals bullying.  The supervisor had the nerve to ask me if I tried smiling at her and saying good afternoon when I walked in at the classroom changeover.

I first did a masters in anthropology at a university in China and have been teaching English at the same university for roughly the past four years. My plan for a long time was to eventually come back to the US and teach Chinese (I am fluent and have a bachelor's degree in it from the University of Mississippi). I figured I would go the private school route since I don't have a degree in education or a teacher's license. I realize this was overall probably a dumb plan, but I was young and stupid, and this is where I am now. There's nothing changing the past, and I'm looking forward to the future. I am passionate about teaching and would love teaching Chinese to highschool students, (preferably in TN/the Nashville area, as that is home, but I am open to other options). I know several private schools in the Nashville area have Chinese programs (or had some, but the teachers left), so my original plan was simply applying to various schools and hoping to get a job based off of my knowledge of Chinese and teaching experience. But now I'd like to see how I can make myself more competitive/open up more options for myself, but I'm not gonna lie, all the possibilities seem overwhelming. I have several questions and any advice would be extremely appreciated. I have no one else to ask, so I come to you.

1. If I want to go the private school route, should I be looking at masters of education programs? I've been looking at some online options that I could do while I'm still here in China. (I'm estimating I'll still be here for at least another two-ish years as I'm wrapping up some personal matters.)
2. If a masters in education would be good, then what kind? I didn't realize there were so many types and I'm not sure if any would be particularly relevant, or if it doesn't matter as long as it's a masters in education. Western Governor's University seems pretty popular on Reddit, but it looks like the only program that might apply to me is the Master of Science in curriculum and instruction, (others are degrees for teachers who have licenses, or for seeking licensure in other topics out of my field/interest) and I'm not sure how to know what a potential employer might think of that degree. Another online program that was recommended to me by a friend is a Master of Education in educational leadership from Trevecca Nazarene. But I'm also not sure what a potential employer might think of that if my (initial) aim is to teach, and not be a principal.
3. Should I try to do a program where I can get licensure? If so, how? As said, WGU has some programs, but for other fields (primary school education, secondary school science, etc).
4. Are their online licensure programs for teaching foreign languages? (Or is there not even demand for Chinese language teachers in public schools like there is for Spanish, French, etc?) So far the only program that I've found that offers licensure for teaching a foreign language (including Chinese) is from Peabody at Vanderbilt, but its hella expensive and must be done as a full time student in person.
5. Or should I continue the ESL route and get an online degree with ESL licensure? (If there is such a program.) I think I would enjoy teaching Chinese (and being able to share with students about life in China/Chinese culture/my experiences there), but if there's possibly more money in ESL/more demand in public schools, I have experience there anyways.

Bonus question (Tennessee specific). What are private school ""categories""? And do you need licensure to teach at certain categories vs others? I found a list of the categories on the TN department of education website, but can't seem to find a clear answer on if categories affects who they can hire or not.

1684878888.0,Wastefulness Rant,"I switched to a neighboring district from a charter this year, and so far it’s been ok.  Despite making less and stressing over finances, and having to get screwed over by the district with pay increases… like I’m not getting one in the fall because the “negotiations” were for last year’s “contract”.  I should at least have a high range “effective” or low range “highly effective.”  But I digress.

This is our last week, and the students are cleaning out their lockers.  Their textbooks are going into bins for recycling.  Problem is that they’re going in there regardless on whether they’ve been used.  Next year the district will buy new sets.

While walking past the bins, I saw several unused books in there… like this is the first time they’ve seen daylight unused.  Estimated several thousand dollars worth of books.  Just today.  On my floor.  Apply statistically, I can probably infer there’s at least tens of thousands of dollars wasted with this practice.  Probably pushing closer to at least a $100k for all the middle and high schools.

My question is why?  The district complains “tHeRe’S nO mOnEy In ThE bUdGeT fOr PaY iNcReAsEs”, and then does stupid crap like this.  I know for the charter, we’d submit the total number of unused books on our checklists to be reused next year, saving the school thousands from having to rebuy new books for every student.

My business background is having a hard time wrapping my brain around this.  I asked why we’re doing that, and was just told “I dunno.  It’s a contract.”  If I was looking over the financial budget for a company and saw this type of waste, I’d be recommending a renegotiation of that contract or a different vendor.

How the hell am I supposed to teach the negative impacts of deforestation, then tell the kids “meh, dump your books in bin” with a straight face?

/TLDR - no money for pay increases, but plenty to dump unused books only to rebuy the same thing next school year.",teaching

1684792683.0,Need some advice,"

So here is some background:

I have 2 girls in elementary (3 next year)  and last summer, in July, I reach out to the principal and let him know I am doing a Bachelors in Elementary Education. I ask him if he has any positions available, like para or sub positions, for THIS current school year. He reaches out and says, ""yes! I actually need to fill a 1st grade teacher spot, would you be interested?"" I'm surprised because I don't have the degree yet and even though my state allows for provisional license, I don't think I qualified at the time. Plus, it would be really overwhelming for me. So I think about it but reach out to my friend who was a previous 1st grade teacher and she decides to take the position instead. He then offers me a site based sub spot for the year and a long term sub position in the middle of the year. I decide that's much better and I'll get a lot of experience. 

I do the long term sub position with zero support and I'm put on a really dysfunctional team. Which everyone knew but me. It was awful. No one was doing their job and often there wouldn't be any plans in and I had to create my own. With zero professional experience doing that. I pull 11pm nights constantly and the class is also an extremely difficult class with at least 5 boys who have ADHD. It was all just extremely difficult and I had zero resources. Because I was a long term sub I didn't get any of the resources first year teachers get. 

I was told by many staff members I rocked it and the kids test scores were actually really good. I did make great relationships with those kids. After that I go back to just site base subbing. The principal never saw me teach, never asked me how it was going...nothing. 

I request a meeting with him and the vice principal, letting them know my intentions and wanting a teaching position at that school next year. (I finished my degree at this time). They say okay, thanks for letting us know...we have to move teachers around and then we'll let you know what's available.
 It would be silly for me to teach anywhere else since Ill have a 5th grader and kinder coming in. It's 2min from my house and all my kids have done all their years there. 

Fast forward, I give him some time and reach out because I know who has jobs in all positions next year. He tells me he has nothing and I find out he gave one of the student teachers a job. Plus he hired 2 spots for 4th grade. I have way more experience than this teacher and have a reason to be there. I am so confused and have gotten zero explanation. He's friendly in most settings with me but I get so nervous around him. I actually don't care for him as an administrator but love the staff and know everyone. 

Should I ask what happened? Should I ask why I didn't get picked? I had told him I wasnt going to go anywhere else because my kids were here and he agreed it would be silly to pull my kids from the school and teach somewhere else. 

I keep finding out so and so has a para job next year or a sub job...I'm feeling like this is personal. But I seriously can't think of any reason why it would be. I did a good job, I get along with others, and the kids love me.

Any tips for a brand new teacher (no classroom experience) doing a demo lesson?,"I am a recent college graduate with my BSc in biology, and I recently interviewed with a nearby private school for a position as a middle school science teacher. I applied for the job because I have had experience (which I enjoyed) teaching other college students about technical topics, and the position does not require a teaching certification in my state, since it's a private school. The interview went really well, and now they want me to come in this week to tour the school and give a 20 minute demo lesson to a 7th grade class. Obviously teaching a lesson off the bat comes with the territory, but I feel completely out of my depth!

I don't have experience teaching children in a classroom setting, but one of my responsibilities at my old job was occasionally educating very small groups (usually 2-3) of young children about basic life science topics. Otherwise I don't have any experience working with large groups of kids. The school is relatively small, with classes usually between 15-20 students, but that is still way more than I've ever worked with. I also have never developed a lesson plan, which is something that my interviewers will want this week. 

Should I accept this follow-up interview? I feel extremely intimidated by the thought of developing a brand new lesson plan and leading a classroom for 20 minutes, but it's a teaching job so I would have to get comfortable doing this pretty much immediately. I think I have the right demeanor to be a teacher, since I'm patient and personable, and I know that there's a teaching shortage as well.

I plan on giving a box of chocolates and a card each, for 5 teachers. For 3 teachers, I can easily write them a card each since I had each of them for a class. 

However for the other 2 teachers, I don't recall having any classes with them, but I did enjoy volunteering in their classes when I was last there 3 years ago, and I have known of them for years. So I planned on giving them the gifts too, but I don't know how I would write the card. Back in 2020, I spent a week at the school volunteering.

So then my option for those 2 teachers was no card, but I feel like I can't give them the chocolate without the card. So should I still be giving them something?
Maybe I should give only one card that addresses all 5 teachers, but that lacks the personal touch? I just don't want them to feel left out but I might be

1684528379.0,Secured a History position and still CANNOT believe it!!,"Hey everyone!

I applied to over 16 positions in my district, conducted interviews (in the few that even gave a response) and was discarded for not having experience. Small talk with an unknown individual that turned out to be a principal turned into an on the spot offer teaching HS History for a position that was not even advertised. This school is in the suburbs and seldom has openings, and it is not a Title 1 school. Sometimes the best things come when you least expect it, especially considering that Social Studies is a saturated subject and always has fierce competition for the openings that arise.

For any of you that are out there and unsure if you'll get a position for the next school year, these are my tips:

1) You CANNOT give up. If this is truly your goal, you will find a position, IT WILL open up. People are hired and pull back at the last second, and it will be nearer to the beginning of the school year when you may get surprise calls. You need to be flexible with the area you are in.

2) You must always remember that landing a job is NOT within your control. I have come to realize that most openings already have a person that will take them, and the position is posted because the law requires public service jobs to be advertised and ""competitive"". If it were up to us, we would all be living in a wonderland.

3) ATTEND the job fairs. You might want to be at a desirable school but not have much experience, which means that others might have the upper hand. Take what you can if there is an offer, and remember, there is always next year. Once you get your foot in the door, it can make it easier to move around. If there is no opening in the school you want, you should get the contact information and at least make a connection with the administrators there from that particular school. If they ever see your name or face in the future, they will remember and will likely opt for you than somebody else. Takes me to number 4.

4) Email and contact administrators in schools around your area. Demonstrate your enthusiasm for landing a teaching position for X subject, and the competitive skills you might bring. Something as simple as being bilingual or training employees where you work can help. 

5) Talk to the union/association. Where I live, they are weak. However, they have a strong network of individuals. I reached out to a specialist that let me know about the openings that are NOT on the district hiring sites. Most of the time administrators want to hire people they know or that they have already screened, because it takes a long time for processing to occur. If you are to do number 3 and 4, it will make securing a position that much easier. Contacting HR helps SO much because they can guide you, and will ABSOLUTELY be willing to vouch for you and serve as a reference. 

I thought that I would just upload this because I see so many people get frustrated with the job search.

During this time I accumulated: Level 3 Nursery Practitioner, Level 3 Early Years Educator, Level 3 Teaching and Learning in Schools. I’m First Aid Trained, OFSTED Registered, have acquired training on policies, legislations and more thanks to my course and experience.

I babysit regularly, have been a Nursery Practitioner for 2 years and spent 2 years in a primary school as a Teaching Assistant. I have also volunteered in schools. 

MY (planned) SERVICES: - ANY ADVICE OR INFORMATION IS WELCOMED ❗️

Nannying / Tutoring:
Essentially, I will babysit children and offer Education alongside, like home schooling/ a private-at parent’s home-Nursery Practitioner/Primary School Tutor. 
I would charge the average Nannying price with an additional cost during the Education/Tutoring hours. 
I would bring my own learning and play resources for all ages, however will be focusing more on Early Years (0-5years).
I would conduct observations and assessments of the child including milestones, learning development, 7 areas of development, general information.
I would also create sentimental gifts for parents and family including a portfolio of the child’s experience in my car, personalised story books/memory books, picture frames, holiday gifts and more.

1684278230.0,The emotional weight of working with children.,"Hey Y'all,

I'm a college student who is currently working towards a degree in education. I know it doesn't pay particularly well, and I know that it's exhausting work, but that isn't what worries me. I currently work part-time as a para for a very small school in my hometown, and I've found the hardest part of it hasn't been the teaching, the noise, or even the disrespect, it's been the behaviors that I recognize as intrapersonally negative.

I've got a fairly deep college education in childhood developmental psychology, I grew up as a disabled person in an angry, impatient, and hostile house, and I went to a school that put me down for my entire time there, and I see the anxieties that I developed as a result in the students I work with. Sometimes they open up, sometimes they don't, but it's incredibly difficult to see a kid burst into tears when receiving praise for their effort and work, or watching them break down when they make mistakes. There are countless other behaviors that I can recognize that become incredibly heavy. 

I really feel for these kids, and I want to help them as much as I possibly can, but that weighs heavily on me when I see it. If anything is going to kill my love of this work, it's going to be the overwhelming weight of kids struggling in ways they shouldn't have to. 

How do y'all manage it? I can't imagine it's any easier for professionals, but maybe y'all have found a way to help them, or at least send them in a positive direction after you've worked with them. If y'all have, I would greatly appreciate hearing it. I don't want to give this up, but I can't really handle the weight of it all.",teaching

1684267212.0,Looking for Activities to Entertain High Schoolers,"Hello all, 

I am helping develop a schedule of activities for weekly teen events at my community centre, teens aged 14 to 19. 

I don’t have much experience with this age group, but I’m looking to organize indoor activities that are low cost, require minimal to no equipment and are easy to set up. Activities we have tried in the past are human bingo, jenga, and board games. 

Thanks very much for your help!",teaching

I am not completely sure who did it, but I have an idea of a couple it may have been. Any advice for getting it to stop? I’m thinking of maybe quietly sending the potential offender to the office until they either confess or tell who did it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",teaching
1684190459.0,Too Harsh with Failing Senior,"Apparently I was too harsh with a Failing Senior today. This student frequently slept through class, stared off into space, skipped, showed up 30 minutes late, etc. Almost never did their work. Grades are due for Seniors tomorrow to say whether or not they can graduate.

Mind you, this student has come in four times before asking what they can do to get their grade up, same answer every time: Do your work. During those times, they never submitted a single assignment.

Student has 15% in my class. I've contacted home (obviously), parents don't respond to calls or texts. Even the counselor can't get ahold of them. I've had a countdown on the board for over a month. I spoke directly with the seniors who were failing.

So, when they came in today with the same old question which doesn't have another answer, I honestly told them: ""You need to actually do your work. Not just come in and show up for a test that you never learned the content for because then you're going to flunk the test anyway. You need to pay attention in class instead of doing X behaviors I've observed from you. You are welcome to sit down and take any tests you'd like, but I can't reteach an entire trimester's worth of content in a single afternoon.""

Student stared at the ground and asked to take a test from the beginning of the tri. I unlocked it. They failed the test. Student slammed their computer closed and stormed out of the class. I learned today that reality checks are too harsh...

I'm kind of glad I won't be working for this school next year. I don't know what I'll be doing in a couple months, but I'm tired of this.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Senior with 15% in the class asks what they can do one day before grades are due. Doesn't like that I pointed out their behaviors which brought them to this point.",teaching
1684186923.0,Anyone else being injured…,"… even if “by accident”? Last week a teacher was rammed into and pushed down due to horseplay between two 8th graders. They tried to get their cover story straight. Her elbow still hurts today. Today a student threw a metal water bottle at a peer who dodged and the bottle hit a teacher square in the back. Other students confirmed it was him, but when confronted he just stared and said nothing. No shrug, no denial, just gray rock. I am so paranoid I will get hurt before this year ends, they are out of control. What do we do when this happens?",teaching
1684175519.0,Amazing principal not returning next year. Unsure of my next move…,"First year teacher here, at a title 1. 

The principal is not returning, and she has been the best supervisor I’ve had of any job. I cannot speak highly enough of her. 

Next year this school is offering another  $10,000 to returning or new teachers. Putting my second year salary with a bachelors a little over $60,000.

Do I suck it up, take the bonus, get two years down at one school and then move on? Or do I jump ship now?

The pressure of this job is tolerable, if I was working towards something. 

As it is now, I feel like I am joining a game of Monopoly 20 turns after everyone else. 

Just roll the dice and pay rent, that's my only option. I just want to stop. 

I want to say it's a mental health crisis, but the reality is, my poor mental health comes from social and financial poverty. 

I love Teaching. I love the job, really. But it's hard to keep rolling the dice, knowing I can't buy shit. I just work and work and pay for other people's shit. The only rent free spot on the board is jail. 

I've been thinking about how I could save for retirement and my conclusion is I will not be able to retire. No matter how much personal wealth I accumulate, without a house I will be relying on the generosity of others when I am too old to work.

There is not future in this and I hat being told to roll the dice by people who own everything on the board. Just roll the dice, that's how you win! They say unsarcasticly.

I want to give up. So I gave up. Now I am depressed.",teaching
1684161881.0,How to teach a family member,"I am teaching math to my brother (10 years old, third grade) since a few months ago. In the beginning, I was just considering him the same as my other students and was able to help him by being detached and trying to identify his weaknesses. I would go slowly and make sure he understood every concept, even if it takes more time. I also started preparing him for a math competition at his school. In April he had the competition and did really badly. Meaning that he messed up an exercise like 20+20-20+20. He said is 0. 

Since then, I get angry very easily when I'm working with him and I don't have patience anymore. I don't want to be like this, I feel is making the studying process way worse for him, I want to be supportive and teach him a growth mindset. But after seeing him fail and have such a bad result with easy problems, I subconsciously started believing that I'm wasting my time. 

One explanation that I found is that I attached my ego to his results because we have the same blood and somehow I feel his failure was an attack on myself. I feel like an as\*\*ole for this but I don't know how to control my temper. Maybe it would be better if I stop tutoring him?",teaching

1684136101.0,Started another disappointing class that I have no motivation now.,"Started this acting class through Zoom hoping this one will be better. Like every other class, teacher acts nice during the first class and becomes a jerk after. Most people in these classes don't have any opinion at all, so if you bring up your opinion, the teacher hates you. All the feedback I have gotten so far about my acting is vague. Teacher says I don't seem to understand what I say in my lines (not true at all), not seeing comfortable on the camera and need more classes. I am always the last to perform and I don't wanna wait hours for the others to perform and receive praise but not me. 

Called out last week and haven't done my self-tape/homework for tomorrow because I am like, he is gonna say crap about my performance while my classmates take all the praise.

1684084196.0,I lost my favorite job (Nothing bad happened.),"For context, I worked as a paraprofessional since October of 2022. I never thought that I would love a job this much! I loved, loved, loved helping students! Were there days where I wanted to smack them? Of course, but in the end, I love them all like they’re my own. 

This last Friday, I got called into the principal’s office, and the SPED teacher was also in there. Due to student counts, and what was required for IEP students to succeed, my service at the school is no longer required. They assured that it’s nothing bad, they just didn’t need me there. I had to turn in my badge and computer since I didn’t have the funds to make a full tank. Gotta love adulting. 

I cried for hours after coming back home. I can rest knowing that I did a great job, for not going to college. I definitely plan on continuing doing this, but I miss the students dearly, and it’s still hard for me to wrap around the idea that it just happened. 

Thank you for reading my short vent, and have a great rest of the school year!",teaching

1684018549.0,VCLA question,"I just finished my VCLA reading writing test combo today and got an unofficial print out.

I did pretty well on reading, 89%! But i did terrible on writing. I got about 58% on that lol. I honestly wasn't expecting to even get that good tbh as I didn't study and did pretty bad 3 years ago before going overseas for a while. 

I'm just wondering when i retake the test (guess i'll have to wait 3 month, not sure the time frame they let you retake), do i have to retake both tests or can I keep the high reading score I got and just work on the writing?

 I know you can take both tests separately and keep the scores, but I wasn't sure if that was the same if you took the combo test. I just am trying to avoid as much fees as i can. I did both together this time because There is like a 50$ processing fee

1683917280.0,TX Cert Question,"Hello. I’m K-12 Music and 4-8 ELAR certified. I have about 15 years total experience in middle school ELAR and ELAR instructional coaching. I had to leave education a few years ago due to health complications caused by Covid (and honestly, I was just burnt out). 

I’ve got my health mostly under control and am getting a little stir crazy at home. I volunteered at my daughter’s school and enjoyed working with the 4th graders there. I’m considering applying for a 4th or 5th grade ELAR job if one comes available, but at their school, the reading teachers also teach social studies. Does anyone know how adding elementary social studies to my certificate would work? 

I thought it would just be a matter of taking a content test, but when I was looking into it, it seems like now all the content tests have some “art of teaching reading” attached to it? Has anyone gotten certified for social studies in the lower grades in TX lately? I don’t understand what’s required anymore.",teaching

1683873503.0,How should you get a teaching license?,"Throughout my bachelor education and in the months preceding (I graduated back in December) I have had the desire to be able to teach high school English, however I didn't go to school (yet) for teaching. Instead, I earned a BA in English (Lit), Film & Video Production, and Women's Gender and Sexuality Studies. 

I was wondering as a result what advise and guidance would you provide for qualifying for a teaching license and possibly more importantly, ensure that I am actually able to provide the best educational experience one can feasibly deliver. Some of my other concerns are costs (grad schools sounds great aside from the costs \[but is that just unavoidable?\]) and length of time it would take to be licensed/begin teaching (double edge of don't want to take 4 years to teach but also don't want to teach without being able to actually provide a quality education).

1683821618.0,Have to revamp curriculum and am overwhelmed,"I have been taking a break from teaching since 2019 but have recently signed a contract with a new school for 23-24. I found out they want me to teach Eng 10, which is totally fine since that’s the majority of what I taught at my previous school. 

This school, a high performing charter, doesn’t have curriculum maps. We’re allowed to teach what we want as long as it serves the endgame of the state exams. I asked the 9th grade teacher about her curriculum so I wouldn’t repeat and she is using several of the texts I would normally use in 10th grade. 

So, I’ve been spending a few days trying to think of alternatives. I’d like to do a mix of classic and contemporary. But I’m having to create at least 3 units completely from scratch and update 2-3 more to better differentiate between standards and honors. 

My question is: how can I best do all of this before August? I feel so overwhelmed by my to do list that I don’t know where to start or I start something and get distracted and do something else.

1683819293.0,Looking for resources on the neurobiology of education.,"Title says it all. But hopefully something digestible - not overly academic, but still a bit in the weeds. I’m thinking reoccurring podcasts, blogs, or any books? 

I’m really interested in learning about how the brain functions at each grade level. What does anxiety do to the brain at that age? Depression? Adhd? Trauma? What does it manifest as? 

I am both interested to learn more in general about the brain at each grade level and how students learn. But more specifically I’m also looking for why younger middle school students actually need routines and structure. I want ALL teachers to understand that there is science behind consistency, structure, routines, and it’s not just others being hard asses. I think knowing this science as a new teacher makes being an authority much easier. Starting off 4 years ago, I had a hard time my self being a “warm demander”. But as time has gone on, I realize the vast importance of that and of tone and of course the teacher stare. The irony here is I am in a way anti-authoritarian, but I’m not so radical as to believe that students dont need structure and routines at that age. 

Anyways neurobiology of education???",teaching
1683779575.0,Is trig really necessary?,"Lots of students (and adults) complain that there is little point in learning high level math because they will never use it again in real life. In this clip, Neil deGrasse Tyson argues that ""the act of learning how to do the math \[i.e. trigonometry or whatever\] establishes a new kind of brain wiring ... a problem solving brain-wiring. *It's not about what you learned, it's about what tools, methods, and tactics you had to use in order to solve the problem.""*

I have questions about this.  

First: What specific tools, methods, and tactics is he talking about?  

Second: Is it really the case the only way to learn these ""tools, methods and tactics"" is through learning trigonometry and other mostly-useless mathematical techniques, or could they not also be learned via something *useful* that will actually be *applicable* by most people later in life?",teaching

1683772036.0,Accepted to a Special Education Graduate Cert Prog!,"TL;DR I am excited that my school district is offering a bonus to special education teachers and so I feel justified in going back to graduate school (yet again) to get my cert!

I love my job, I love my school, I love my students (mostly), I love my contract bargaining team, I love my co-workers (mostly) and I love my school administration!

All that being said after getting a BS degree and wondering the wide world I found a home in teaching and got my M ED in secondary science education (a year long program), and I have since become certified in Algebra and love teaching math even more than science.

At various points in my teaching career so far I have though to myself, ""wow, I really wish I had been able to fast track from my undergrad degree to a special education degree because I find advocating and teaching to my special education students so rewarding"". I understand why this isn't a track because obviously you need real world teaching experience or an entire undergrad devoted to learning everything you must to begin a special education teaching career. For a few years now I have considered going back for my special education graduate certificate but thought ""why pay more money, to do more work for exactly the same pay"". I'm an idealist, but not an idiot.

Well this year it happened! The district leadership included a yearly bonus on top of salary step for special education teachers. Even if the bonus doesn't survive past this contract cycle it is enough to pay for the year long master's cert program I am accepted to! I am so excited.

On a related note: My poor partner. He just finished the undergrad program he started the year after I finished my masters. We were both looking forward to both of us not being in school for the first time in our entire relationship. Oh well, there is always next year babes!

Another related note: If you feel over-worked and under appreciated, move to Alaska. They love teachers. I am so much better off career wise than my friends that stayed to teach in our home-state. Feel free to DM me about it.",teaching

They vape. They cheat. They wander. They have sex in the stalls. They have fights and jump other students. They self-harm. They do *Godknowswhat* in the bathrooms and we can't have cameras or guards there, can we? We police the bathrooms so much because THEY CANNOT BE TRUSTED AND THEY ARE MINORS. Many of them could just go but we can't take the chance that they are doing something harmful or illegal because if THAT happens we'll get blamed for every single hair harmed on their head.

The kids are freshmen in high school. They were ready to fight. We were ready to fight for an hour and a half while we waited in the dark. I cussed a lot. We had a couple giggles. I was absolutely terrified I would have to make the choice between my own life and a student’s today. 

After an hour and a half, we found out it was a false threat. No gun in the building. Afterwards kids hugged me and told me what I meant to them. I tried not to cry. 

They didn’t let the kids go home after unless their parents were there. They were expected to go to class. I only had prep left. I have sat and stared and said little. I think this was a career changing moment for me. I LOVE my kids. We have a phenomenal relationship. I’m a really good teacher. But I don’t think I can ever go through this again.

To add: it’s an inner city school where they are not new to violence. They are no stranger to the police and being in cuffs. They are a hard class to teach. I gave them the following speech: “Listen. The police are going to come through and check us. They are going to treat you like a suspect. You put your hands up and say yes sir. I don’t give a fuck if they put you in handcuffs. They have guns. You do what your told, and I’ll handle it later. If you get shot because you want to have an attitude I swear I will come to your funeral and I will make sure you are so fuckin grounded. Are you clear?” I got many “😧yes ma’ams” in return.

We are not daycare for the public.,"I'm not willing to risk my life to do this job.  Schools are petri dishes during normal times. Unless schools are somehow *very* safe, and *extremely* low risk for spread, in person schooling is negligent.  I have asthma and already get sick every year like clockwork from working in a school - and I already give up a lot for low pay - like so many teachers do. It seems like we are in a way being asked to additionally compensate , with our health now, for what the federal/state government isn't providing. If it's not safe to go back to school - then the govt needs to pay people to stay home, pay for services that school can't currently provide, and pay for child care. We should be throwing money and resources at districts and communities to set up for effective and engaging distance learning options  - instead we're throwing together piecemeal, untested options using limited budgets that put already underpaid and overworked teachers and staff at risk. It is extremely short sighted and irresponsible. This is temporary - we are fighting a once a century pandemic.

I just quit mid year. Last Friday, I was offered a chance to work at a nonprofit and I took it. Same pay, but tons of flexibility, teaching adjacent, guaranteed cost of living raises, full benefits, 2 minute commute. After months paralyzing anxiety and panic attacks brought on by the worst school year ever, I am completely over the moon to be diving into a new career!

But I can’t share my news, because every single time I tell someone they says some variation of “those poor kids, abandoned mid year…”

And yes. I feel like shit over that. I have cried over this decision. But ultimately I decided that a sub or mid year hire is likely going to be more effective than a teacher who can barely function due to her anxiety. And at some point in my life, I have to learn to put myself first. 

So if someone tells you they are quitting mid year, please don’t make them feel even shittier about their decision. We’re all just trying to survive.

1674837592.0,"Teaching is an awful, awful profession.","I work as a substitute (daily and long term assignments) right now while my job is in its off season and let me just say that teaching is an absolutely horrendous job to step into. Who cares about summers off or a pension when you have to have to deal with working in this career field.

*Now* I see why so many in the teaching profession warn prospective teachers and college grads to take their talents elsewhere. *Now* I see why more than fifty percent of teachers quit and flee the profession by their third year. *Now* I see why there is a teacher shortage. *Now* I see why there are hundreds upon hundreds of vacancies for teaching job positions. *Now* I see why teachers talk about crying in their car after their shift ends or wanting to get hit by a semi on their way to work.

This is a horrid and dreadful profession and it is only getting worse.

Allow me to list what I have seen and experienced during my time as a sub :

\- **Oversized classrooms**. Every single classroom that I have subbed for has had a preposterously excessive amount of students. Being the only adult or teacher figure in such a predicament feels overbearing and makes classroom management virtually impossible because seldomly do that many students simultaneously stay on task.

\- **Negative student behaviors**. Elementary kids will get on their Chromebooks and play video games all day regardless of what directions you give them. Middle school kids will shout sexual innuendos at each other, vape in the bathrooms, regurgitate dumb phrases and songs from social media, intentionally mock you loud enough for you to hear them and stay out of their seats all class period. High school students openly cheat, openly curse, openly skip class, openly tell teachers that they can't teach and openly hate being in school.

\- **Short prep periods**. 40 or 60 minutes is not enough time to get a break away from teaching five or six consecutive classes or class content. It isn't enough time to gather yourself and prepare yourself for the next class or topic. Not only is the length of the prep periods minimal, but there aren't enough of them.

\- **Excessive work load**. Bloated lesson plans and piles and piles of paperwork. Additionally, teachers are expected to act as prison wards (constantly checking to make sure that ID badges are on, constantly checking that phones are put away, constantly checking for vapes, checking to see how long students have been in the bathroom) and school psychologists (checking for signs of bullying, depression, poor nutrition etc).

\- **Too much noise**. Having to hear people continuously talking for 8 hours a day is a dismal, melancholic experience. It's too much. Constant chatter, constant sound of chairs squealing, constant sound of sneezing, constant knocks at the door, constant ""can I use the bathroom?"", constant questions and comments. It is horrific. My eardrums feel like they are being assaulted any time that I am in a classroom.

\- **Classroom odors**. I have yet to be in a classroom that didn't smell like a combination of used jock straps, spoiled hamburger meat and raw sewage. Maybe others have a high tolerance for putrid odors but I'm not one of those people. Classrooms and hallways stink and always smell like flatulence and dead bodies.

\- **Micromanagement**. There is very little room to do your job. Not only do you have administration enforcing various draconian rules on you but you also have your students also watching you like a hawk. Anything you say or do, they will alert their parents and then their parents will come up to the school demanding that you talk to them during your prep period or after your contract hours.

\- **Unrealistic expectations**. A large chunk of students do not care about school, don't even want to be there and put no effort in learning. Teachers are held accountable for that and told that if a child doesn't want to learn or cannot pass a class, it's because they did not motivate, inspire or build a connection with the child. Teachers are told to pass failing students and are told to meet metrics that are becoming more and more unobtainable by the year.

\- **Too many extra duties**. Recess duty. Lunch duty. Carpool duty. Crosswalk duty. Hall monitor duty. Morning duty. Bus duty. Sponsor this club. Sponsor that club. After school tutoring. Before school tutoring. School dance chaperone.

This was my experience and observation in the education environment as a substitute. I can only imagine how utterly horrifying it is as an actual teacher.

In addition to that, I'm a licensed paramedic in my state, have my bachelors degree & license in clinical social work, and also have my substitute teacher certificate. I work primarily in a high school, but there's a seperate K-8 building on campus with it's own SRO. 

I've dealt with an ""almost"" school shooter in the past. We pulled him from class less than 90 seconds before the passing period he planned to begin his attack during. He had dads handgun in his pants when we pulled him out. Dads rifle, an obscene amount of ammunition, and knives were in his locker. We all know that lockdowns are ineffective security theater, but the lockdown wasn't even called until after the passing period began. If the situation was just a little bit different, we were further away or he decided to leave class a minute early, children would have died. 

Conservative answer to this? Arm teachers, police in schools, harden the buildings. Principal is armed, and this is a hardened campus. Without going into details, ridiculously hardened. Police in schools? Yep, check. Hire retire military? Check - my partner in the grade school is a multi-tour combat veteran in Iraq & Afghanistan with special forces experience, more than one purple heart, and awards for valor in combat. 

None of that matters though. Just the slightest change of plans, luck, or time? People would have died. I would have responded, my partner would have responded, sure. Doesn't change a single thing. This is a child who was ready to die for his chance to kill as many people as possible, and there would have been a firefight in the middle of our local high school. Even if that firefight happened before he started shooting at kids, this is a high school. Walls aren't bulletproof, there's no safe backstop, humans aren't accurate. Kids probably still would have died, possibly at our hands not the kid. 

We train and practice on this too, and every disgusting detail of it. We help your children practice how to run for their lives, hide for their lives, and fight as a last stand for their lives. We practice stepping over and ignoring the dead and dying children, then finding the assailant and returning fire, and then searching for secondary threats. Would you like to know what else we practice? We practice triage, determining saving which children does the greatest good for the greatest number. Determining which of your children has been injured to the point of incompatibility with life, and then tagging their bodies as such so the limited medical resources aren't wasted on the corpses of your children. We then practice the working with the coroner and death investigation responses. 

We will tabletop the details of the recent school shooting utilizing our guidelines provided by the FBI, homeland security, and the secret service. What other country is that a normal sentence to say? 

While on the topic of conservatives, I'll discuss some of the other horseshit that's on my mind. 

One common thing is I've heard among conservatives, wanting police in schools to protect the rights of their children. There's many exceptions though, most notable of the two within just the first amendment: 

They don't want us protecting our children's first amendment right to freedom from compelled political speech in school, as solidified by Tinker vs Des Moines Community ISD, determined back when the Supreme Court was a respectable institution. They want children to be indoctrinated & forced to pledge allegiance to a flag representing values they may not believe in. 

They don't want us protecting the 1st amendment right to religious expression. They would like the establishment clause to be gutted, christianity to be instituted as the state religion, children to be indoctrinated into it, and free exercise of other non-conforming religious beliefs to be suppressed. 

Only their version of Christianity too. The version where idolatry is okay when it's guns or a flag. Indoctrination is okay as long as it's indoctorination for their points. Also better not teach about racial discrimination or their rights against it. 

No conservative truly gives a shit about mental health either until it's a useful diversion from the topic at hand, guns. People with guns kill people, at least in America. It's that simple. We can look at countries like Switzerland where people can be responsible with guns to divert from the topic of what's happening in America. But we aren't Switzerland. ""Guns aren't the problem, people are!"" Even if that's the case, when we have a population incapable of responsibility with guns, removing the guns is the solution. 

I'll openly admit to being a bleeding heart liberal. I think guns and conservatives are the main problem here. I'm absolutely, definitely not letting the left wing off the hook though here. There's a bit of fault for this shit on the left too. 

Gutting discipline in schools for ""equity"" and providing ""grace"" is apart of this. How the fuck is it equitable to allow school to be an unsafe, dangerous, out of control environment? That's just disadvantaging the often minority groups we serve. How the fuck is cultural sensitivity a valid excuse for that, and how is that graceful? Why is allowing & perpetuating the trauma that's apart of why we have school shooters the solution? 

I'm tired. I'm fucking exhausted. I'm tired of how this country is, I'm tired of extremists, and I'm tired of death.

1679783289.0,I had to send my student home with her abusive father.,"One of my 7th graders was no contact with her dad at the beginning of the school year for very legit reasons. He showed up at school in October to pick her up and I told him he wasn't supposed to be there. He was escorted to admin as he was calling the police to say I was keeping him from his daughter (go ahead, bro). He ended up screaming at a bus full of children, admin had to get daughter off of bus as she hysterically cried, and then she hid under the secretary's desk until her mom and the police arrived. Dad was trespassed from school and had his visitation rights formally revoked. 

Cut to last week, some idiot judge in my county believed that this walking dumpster fire was a fit parent and immediately restored unsupervised visits. So yesterday, the last day of school before Spring Break, I had to walk a terrified girl to her father's car so she could spend the weekend with him. She had a phone in her pocket from her mom so her location is always known, and I wrote down my teacher email address so if she needs to tell me something that needs to be reported, she doesn't have to wait until break is over. She cried at dismissal time and all the girls gave her a group hug to show their support. Dad gave me a death glare as he got her into the car. She refused to hug him (good girl!)

I just feel so helpless and so angry at the family courts. I watched this girl retreat into her own mind last year as the situation with her dad got worse. I read the scary things she wrote in her journal about wanting to hurt herself. And just when she is beginning to act like herself again, I have to send her home with this douche canoe.

1676738291.0,Is... this what freedom to teach feels like?,"I have been at a new district this year and a new school. Since the start of the year we have politely asked around 17 kids to leave because it was clear they weren't interested in school and we're just there to socialize. They didn't do tests, homework, etc and their scores showed it. We had three meetings per kid about what we were going to do, what their parents had to do, and what was expected of the student... We documented our efforts but the behavior didn't change. 

They were transferred to another school because it was clear we weren't the place for them because their educational needs weren't being met to show any improvement.

Kids act up, get a meeting with admin about what they need to do to remain at this school, a meeting with admin and their parents to discuss what they need to do... And if they don't? They don't get to remain at our school.

We're a public school and there's another public school across the street that's larger than us; it's not like they're not going to get educated. But, knowing that if I tell admin a kid is absolutely disrupting my class it's not on my shoulders to try and perform some magic trick -- the student is held responsible for their behavior and there's a very real chance of losing the privilege of school of choice?",teaching

I am irritated that parents aren’t letting their kids fail. I don’t have kids, but I was a kid whose mom let me fail, and miraculously, I learned from it and never made that mistake again. It was in 7th grade, the grade I currently teach. I waited until literally the night before our science fair project was due to begin it. My mom did not help. My mom did not write email after email to my teacher making excuses, begging for more time, and spinning a sob story of how hard I tried. No, my mom let me fail. I didn’t “fail.” I probably earned a C, but for a student who typically earned As, it was a failure to me. While I may have procrastinated a few times after, it was never to the extent of what happened with that science fair project. Parents: You are failing your child by not letting them fail. One “C” in middle school isn’t the end of the world, and it’s much better to earn that C in middle school rather than in high school where the GPA counts more heavily. GPA isn’t really a thing in middle school until 8th grade. Your child should not have waited until the DAY BEFORE THE EXTRA CREDIT was due to begin it. Your child should know how to check and read his emails. Your child should know that he will not get credit for plagiarizing his assignment. Your child would have those horrible feelings of failure and disappointment to motivate him not to make those mistakes again if you hadn’t sent me a barrage of emails, if your husband, a 35-year veteran teacher who apparently has no clue what plagiarism is, hadn’t sent me emails, and if administration hadn’t stepped in to force my hand to offer your precious baby a second chance on extra credit.

1634359612.0,"I Almost Quit, but Decided to Just Teach","I went into this school year ready for anything. That ""anything"" didn't include 95% of what hit me like a freight train in just my first week. The kids that got dropped in my lap this year were beyond anything I ever expected. 

On day 1, I had a student (5th Grade ELA) stand on his desk and beat on his chest while screaming absolute nonsense. It wasn't even words. It was just guttural noise. This student proceeded to jump down and crawl on the floor across my classroom. All I could do was stand there and think ""What the absolute fuck is happening?"". This same phrase has now become a constant in my mind.

I spent my first entire month crying after work on my drive home. Between the kids, constant crazy expectations, PD days everytime I turned around, and the ""can you help out with this or that"", I was dying. I seriously went to my doctor and asked him to please give whatever drugs, even experimental, you can to just help me handle all of this. *He didn't do that, but did adjust some of meds to help with my anxiety. 

My biggest problem was that I wanted to teach, but felt like I was being pulled in some many different directions that I wasn't even allowed to do my actual job. The night before I was about to put in my 2 week notice, it hit me. They aren't going to fire me for not complying to half of the shit that they are wanting me to do. I'm ready to quit, so being fired, isn't too much different (I know recommendations are needed on a resume, of course). 

I decided to teach, really teach. If our district office came by to look at my data wall, I was already prepared to tell them "" Dat a Wall ain't a happening"". I broke all of the stupid rules. I never had my students open their textbooks that I hated. I read 2 different novels and did activities with those novels that the kids loved. I refused meetings that weren't beneficial or related to my actual planning during my planning period. I also quit working, grading, or planning after school. My room or lessons aren't Pinterest perfect anymore, but that's okay.

I was constantly second guessing my new approach, but I was happier. My students were also generally doing better. They were and are still crazy, but we've all developed a relationship in which we are able to manage it. 

So, did this work? As in, did my mandatory 9 week benchmark tests satisfy those above me? Did my craziness with the intention of doing what I felt was best for my students actually work? It actually did!!!! My 5th graders performed on their 9 weeks benchmark test higher than my class the year before. Their overall proficiency was higher than their beginning of the year benchmark and state test from last school year. 81% of all of my students passed that damn test too. My 5th graders also scored 15% higher on all aspects of the test compared to the rest of the district.

1589079635.0,Switching to Online Teaching,"A bit long, but I get these questions and comments a lot lately. ""What's it like online teaching?"" ""Are you still working?"" ""Must be nice to have a break, haha""

Switching to online teaching is a bit like being a chef at a fancy restaurant that flooded. Now I cook from a food truck, but my community expects the same dining experience.

Normally, I carefully pick herbs and vegetables from the garden (that I grow myself), buy protein from various farms, and order in special items. I spent all year creating my menu and ordering all the food, but I had to throw out half of it because I can’t prepare it the same way in my food truck.

I cook meals for 125 kids a day, 5 days a week. I set the table with dishes and cutlery that I carefully polish, and bring in my own flowers, candles, and tablecloths to make it a welcoming dining experience. I invite all of my kids (and even parents) to dine at my restaurant.

44 diners do not show up, even though they said they would come. I can see them walking by the restaurant, but despite asking them repeatedly to come in and eat for free, they don't want to. I phone, email, text, and video conference with them and their parents, but it's like they've completely vanished.

11 claim they don’t know where the restaurant is, despite dining here the whole year. I email them a map. They arrive. They claim they don’t know how to eat lobster. I show them how. Their parents phone and want instructions on how to eat lobster. I also show them how with instructions, a video, and several books on the subject. The kid decides they don’t like lobster, even though they haven’t taken a single bite. I offer them a different dish. They leave. Their parents complain that I didn’t feed them. They leave after the first week.

12 complain about the food selection, even though I have carefully adapted my menu to serve vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, paleo, low-sodium, low-carb, gluten-free, and check for allergens for each kid. I went to several meetings and courses to learn how to make these dishes. Their parents complain because I didn’t have a keto plate. Two parents thanks me for the support with their kid's low-sodium meals. They leave the restaurant after two weeks, but I still have to call and see if they want to come and eat. I feel like an annoying telemarketer, they don’t even pick up the phone now.

10 want me to cut up their steak into little bites and then spoon-feed them their meal. They ask every night for this, even though I've been working all year to try and get them to eat on their own. I can't serve other kids because I get tied up trying to feed so many individuals. Sometimes I will get lucky and can get a waiter to help me cut up the food, but with budget cuts, my restaurant can't afford that many waiters. I wonder why their parents haven’t taught them how to use utensils yet, but quickly find out that their parents have been cutting their food for them their whole lives. They leave after the third week.

5 kids show up at 5pm, 9pm, 3am, and on weekends and want me to feed them, despite having my hours posted and well-communicated. I still feel bad for not feeding them.

8 kids want me to deliver the food to them. It’s a bit more work, but I have no problems doing it. I adapt my menu so they get hot food, and I even use my own plates. When the waiters deliver the food now, they won’t answer the door. I never get my plates back.

7 kids leave their food virtually untouched, only picking out the pieces they like and leaving the rest. Their parents want to know what their kid ate every day, even though they could simply ask their kid. Or check their dining app. Or their emails.

12 kids show up when their parents force them, pretend to eat the food, but actually dump their plate into the trash can when their parents aren't looking. I ask them if they want another plate, but they don't respond. They show their parents the empty plate, and parents are too busy to notice. I don't blame the parents because I know they're stressed and overworked, but I still worry about their kids.

16 kids show up on time, eat the food, and even say thank-you. They fill my heart so full I could cry. I want to hug their parents. I am so thankful for these students because they remind me why I chose to become a chef for a living. It's not a job, it's a career and a large part of my identity.

Running the food truck is exhausting, but the relaxed dress code is a perk. I’m lucky because I don’t have my own kids to feed and nurture, on top of running the restaurant. I don’t know how those chefs do it. I hope I can go back to my restaurant, but with the flooding, I’m not sure I’ll have a job there in the fall. I wonder if all chefs feel this way.

Edit: Oh my gosh thanks for these awards, this started as a post to blow off steam. Thank you all so much for filling my bucket:)",teaching

So a teacher within our district, after fulfilling their student engagement requirements and while doing work from home, bakes a cake. Turns out they were really proud of their cake because they posted about their cake on social media. Soon after the full unpleasant underbelly of our entire community turned against this teacher. Apparently teachers aren’t meant to have a life. 

For me this really illustrates some common misconceptions people have about teaching. They seem to think it is standing in front of others and talking at them the whole time. So that is what they expect from online learning-they expect teachers to be sitting at home on their computer the whole day making videos and talking at students. 

Anyway. New rule teachers can’t have lives outside of their career.",teaching
1620674725.0,No more PD from speakers who abandoned the classroom,"Apologies in advance for this rant... My district recently had a PD session addressing the issue of burnout--good for them for recognizing the problem--but the speaker was condescending and awful. I won't name them or their program. They started off talking about how stressful their four or five years in the classroom were. Then during a cry in the parking lot they apparently had this wild revelation about needing to feel ***burned-in*** instead of ***burnt-out***. They left the classroom and opted for the PD circuit instead.

Coming at the end of a school year where my school had four different schedules and all of us felt like first-year teachers again, the PD speaker's presentation felt downright insulting. They haven't been in the classroom for at least four years. They didn't experience spring 2020. They haven't seen any of the stress and horror we've seen this year. To be blunt, the speaker couldn't hack it in a regular classroom and decided to make themselves feel good telling other professionals how to do a job they couldn't handle for themselves. I had a student teacher last semester. I would rather listen to an eight-hour presentation from her than five minutes from the burnt-in speaker because at least my former student teacher understands what we've gone through this year. 

This is not to say that any PD speaker who left the classroom shouldn't speak to teachers. There are some phenomenal people out there who have earned the right to tell us how to improve. Manny Scott, in particular, is an absolute inspiration. I love him and his books. 

On the PD evaluation, I and my PLC wrote we would walk out if administration ever invited that speaker back again. After all we've been through, administrators must be more careful in who they select to come see us and tell us how to improve in our jobs. They have to get people who understand what the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 years have been like for us. The PD speaker circuit is filled with people who abandoned their classrooms a long time ago and wouldn't last a week in today's classrooms. Teachers have to stand up for our profession and relevant PD so those non-contact days matter.",teaching

Cursive practice doesn't take up a lot of mental bandwidth, so while this is going on, we make small talk and get some good SEL in. I'm also circling the room like a helpful shark, giving praise and advice.

It's such a lovely way to start the day, you guys. It seems to help them get into the learning mindset first thing - cursive is a very grown-up skill, and progress is easy for them to discern. Plus, not only do the kids love learning it, I've had at least a half dozen parents thank me for teaching it. 

(Honestly, I don't even care if the kids continue to write in cursive on the regs; I just want them to be able to read it. Don't tell them I said that.)

My district's reasoning was: ""We are stewards of taxpayer money and have a responsibility to our community to safeguard against wasteful spending. We must be intentional in taking steps to minimize any perception that any employees are getting a “free” day off with pay."" So it's to appease people who think we're doing nothing?? The same people who probably think teachers are only babysitters, regardless?? Instead of defending teachers and the immense pressure and workload that we're drowning in, and demonstrating that WE DO WORK even at home, the district decided to just make us go in instead (under unhealthy circumstance), so that we can make the poor taxpayers feel better about themselves.

1678364071.0,62.5%,"62.5%. That is the sum of my observations between two formal observations and one pop-in. I am a failure, according to admin, despite giving it my all, despite my Little Ivy education, despite the hours and hours of lesson planning and professional development. It means nothing to them that my middle and high school students have no discipline, are addicted to their cell phones, cannot distinguish a noun from a verb, and are parented at home by TikTok, YouTube, and Twitch. I am so checked out. This is my eighth cumulative year teaching, but my first at this school district.

Because it is my first year at this school, I have a mentor. Thankfully, there is mentor-mentee confidentiality, so no matter what I tell this person — so long as it isn't threatening to anyone in any way — they cannot reveal anything to admin. I let her know this; I let her know I'm checked out; I let her know I'm looking for other work. From manipulative and gaslighting students to bitchy administration, this job isn't worth the gray hairs popping up in my hair and the heart flutters in my chest at night anticipating the worst the following day.

Not only do we need a total overhaul of the bureaucratic gobble-dee-gook, we need to rescind all the emotional bullshit. No, your kid's feelings are not more important than learning the curriculum; no, your kid's feelings are not more important than learning coping mechanisms at home; no, your kid's fucking feelings are not more important than the rest of the fucking class'! I have been investigated behind my back by admin multiple times for students complaining about me or other students, and each time they tell me after the fact that nothing has been found, but that they felt I should know what transpired. Have you considered that, when a child is failing a class, they lash out? Ffs.

1677812242.0,My principal yelled at me in front of my students and I cried in front of everyone,"I cried at work today in front of my students and coworkers. I am a 1st-8th grade  math interventionist who pulls groups between 3-7 math students throughout the day for 30 minute sessions everyday. I also should note that my groups of students are grouped deliberately known as “soarers”- they often are sent out of the classroom for extreme behavior issues or defiance.

It was the end of the day and my last group of students (7th graders) were 15 minutes late to my math group bc they were late coming in from recess. I would have less than 15 min left of math instruction with them, and these groups can be difficult to get through a lesson, so I decide to play War (the card game) with them. I play math review games or do problem solving every day, but this is the first time we just sit and play a card game. Of course at that moment, my principal and dean (who NEVER observe me and haven’t all year!) came in and saw me playing with them. 

Well instead of pulling me aside and being like “hey, I know they were late but even a few minutes of math is better than nothing. We need to prioritize instruction time” or something to that degree, the principal immediately berates me IN FRONT OF the students, and 2 other groups of students and my coworkers! He yells at how we don’t have time for any games, math proficiency is at 6% and I’m wasting their time, talks down to me like a child and tells me to put away the cards now. I put away the card game but my students immediately felt bad (which they never do, lol) and after they both left, said “we didn’t mean to get you in trouble Miss T”. I assured them they didn’t do anything, got my dry erase boards and we did our 3 min left of linear equations, then walking them back to their classrooms, the tears just started streaming down my face and wouldn’t stop. I was embarrassed and mad at how it was handled, and other students/coworkers saw.

I had a free 20 minutes before pushing into 1st grade and went to the bathroom to cool off. I overheard one of my coworkers outside the door go, “yeah, I saw her- she looked like she was crying” and the principal scoffs and goes “I raised my voice but I was upset, I didn’t do anything wrong! What does she expect?” and I heard him walk away. This principal is a guy whose reputation precedes him: he never apologizes or takes accountability for how he treats people or what he says to staff (ex. “If you don’t like how things are run, you can let me know but I’m not going to change my mind”, “sorry you feel that way but…”), doesn’t listen to criticism or answer questions that may pertain to how things are run, etc. He isn’t even in the building half the time.

I came back from the bathroom after 15 minutes and my math team/coworkers were so nice to me. They asked what’s wrong and I started crying again and said I was just embarrassed and that this isn’t who I am as a teacher, that I do math instruction and I actually had someone come observe me today during 5th grade groups. 

They told me that the principal confronted me in poor taste, that THEIR own students felt bad for me, and that he is bad at talking to people (staff, the kids, and IPS). I know- it’s not a reflection of who I am as a teacher. I don’t think he understands that I didn’t cry bc he yelled at me or that I don’t care, I cried bc I was embarrassed and I care TOO much. It’s not a reflection of my teaching, and I’m mad that this is the one time they decide to leave their office and walk around the building. 

I know I should’ve done my linear equations lesson, but it was already hard enough getting the “soarers” to come straight from recess to my math group, and I wouldn’t have much time left. I let them talk me into playing a game instead since we had so little time. I shouldn’t have done it. I just didn’t like how it was handled, it was degrading. 

My questions are: How do you get past the embarrassment? Or the resentment towards your boss? Did you stay in a place like that for long?

UPDATED update: Got back to work this morning, my Dean called a meeting for our team. Really it was her way of apologizing necessarily without an explicit “I’m sorry”. She said that she can’t control the words that come out of people’s mouths, and that the message was right, but the delivery was wrong. She said that she should’ve pulled me aside and talked to me rather than me getting yelled at in front of my students. She talked to him afterwards- and although the Dean feels remorse, he apparently does not as he stated “I still don’t see what I did wrong”. 😆 All is good, it’s closure for me because I was riddled with anxiety this morning. Thank you again to all of the supportive comments (and fuck the one troll comment)- I love my students and I’m happy to have my soarers excited to learn math each day with me!

Last update: one of my coworkers on the ELL team got out of an IA meeting… tell me why this principal said, “Scores are down right now. I caught one of my math interventionists playing CARDS with her students. She should be lucky she still has a job right now.” Then she says afterwards, he’s talking with one of his staff members and he mentions me BY NAME. I was willing to let it go after his Dean apologized for him… there is no union at my public charter school, but there is the owner of the school that is his higher up. There’s also the district board. I also only have 2 more months, than I will work somewhere where I’m appreciated.",teaching
1602418037.0,Just Do The Work!,"I teach high school: 9th and Pre-AP 10

This is for my 9th graders: Every week my class is the same. We were told parents don’t want their kids in front of the screen for 8 hours a day, cool, I get that. I give maybe 30 minutes worth if work. I tell the kids after explaining the assignment, or just giving them the fucking answers, “Hey! If you think you’ve got it you’re free to log off the Zoom call and get your independent work done. If you have questions, or think you might need help stay and I’ll be more than happy to answer them!” Then I sit in an empty Zoom call for 30 minutes. 

So I have 63 students either failing or in danger of failing. Parents emailing me “Little Johnny/Suzy has NEVER had bad grades before! I don’t understand why they’re having a hard time in your class! They did all their late work but YOU never graded it.” Yo, did your student email me to tell me they turned it in? I don’t know it’s turned in late unless they tell me. I require students to advocate for themselves. Do they work on it during class time and ask me questions if they don’t understand? Closed mouths don’t get fed. Are they doing their Journal? I’ve told them on multiple occasions it’s worth 25% of their grade. Oh they can’t do APEX? It’s credit recovery and I go over the daily section. It’s made to be done WITHOUT a teacher at all. I still go over the concepts with them. Again, did they ask any questions? Did they email me any questions? 

Yes, I understand this is a hard time for everyone. I’m not going to pass your kid because they showed up to the Zoom call. I’m going to pass them if they get work done. It’s about 1/2 of the work we do in person. When we started the directive was “Treat this like as normal as possible. That’s what everyone wants.” and now it’s “They’re all failing, get their grades up!” 

Yooo, look. My class is already easy as fuck, these kids are literally going all over the state (Zoom calling from stores, hair appointments, the car on their way to a family get together), and it’s my fault their failing? Nah, teach your kids to take responsibility for themselves.

I am glad that I did. The students last year forgot how to ""school"". they were stressed, held together with emotional duct tape and prayers.

It's doable because my district is still being safe with their policies.

I want to remind my coworkers of the fear we all had in August when we didn't know how seriously administration was going to take social distancing. We have had time to tell our administration what wasn't working for distancing, and they listened to our concerns. Not all districts are like this.

With that, we’re also putting a ton of trust in parents and kids who a lot of times could not care less about us and our well being. 

Today, a student showed up with a doctor’s note after missing 3 of the last 4 days of school. Ok, no biggie. She said she had allergies. Fair enough. Until I started to dig deeper. I asked this student if they had any other symptoms last week, and low and behold they had a fever, body aches, stomach issues, and a constant cough. She was still coughing frequently today. I asked her if she was tested for covid, and she said, very quickly, “no.”

That did not make me happy to hear in any sense so I called the school nurse and spoke with the principal as well. The local health department told us that she was in the clear because she had a doctor’s note from within the last five days, UNLESS she complains about not feeling well. So after hearing this, I mentioned to the student that I would like for her to let me know if she’s not feeling well at all today. Her response was “but my parents told me not to saying anything” and “they’ll be mad if I have to go home.”

Sure enough, an hour later she told me she was not feeling well (and it was legitimate, she looked miserable). 

The point is, there truly are people who don’t give a shit about teachers or their families. I have people that I go home to that I love very much. I don’t want them getting sick. I feel awful for the kid to have parents teaching her such shit morals.

• “They are taught that they are going to go and do something to those kids.... Do they ever talk about anything except what they are going to do to these kids?""

• ""In colleges, what you hire now is administrators…. Now, because they are appointing all these diversity officers, what are their degrees in? Education. It's easy. You don't have to know anything.""

• “The philosophic understanding at the heart of modern education is enslavement…. They're messing with people's children, and they feel entitled to do anything to them.”

• “You will see how education destroys generations of people. It's devastating. It's like the plague.”

• “Here's a key thing that we're going to try to do. We are going to try to demonstrate that you don't have to be an expert to educate a child because basically anybody can do it.”

Are you furious? TN educators are. Oh, and guess what the governor said in defense of the teachers he is supposed to serve? NOTHING.

Schools are moving to and from “pass/ fail” and all the while parents of students with special needs are complaining that their child isn’t getting a specialized education experience right now!  These same parents that have zero problem demanding this type of instruction or accommodation and pronouncing that a teacher isn’t doing the right thing with their child, well suddenly they’re not a “professional special education teacher” and “cant be expect to help their student with special needs”. 

Yeah. A lot of things aren’t happening RIGHT NOW for a lot of different people. This is a pretty hard situation. You’re going to have to try to work with your child’s needs at home. That teacher you accused of being incompetent did it everyday so I’m sure you’ll figure it out!

Yes, normally I would be concerned if I saw that as well. However! I have brought it up 6 times this year that all of my content, assignments, and attendance have been wiped from Canvas. The longest streak of stability has been 3 days. Each time, I lose everything. My principal asked if I have been exporting the gradebook at the end of each school day, which I have. The problem is that my course (AP Lang) is writing intensive. It takes me a few days to grade each assignment. So I get about half way through grading one assignment before it wipes all the other assignments they’ve submitted in the mean time. Additionally, we are required to leave assignments open until 11:59PM and the courses have been wiping at midnight. That leaves no chance for me to verify who submitted what. Her solution: It’s better to put in what grades you think they deserve then for all of them to have a 100 average. I’m sorry but I can’t “guesstimate” an average for a student their Junior year of high school when they are all competing for top 10% and looking to apply for University at the end of this year. I also reminded her that each time I lost everything I brought it to her attention as well as several other campus administrators that I would be incapable of doing my job if this keeps happening and each time I was told, “technical hiccups are going to happen all year and there’s really nothing we can do about it”.

I've been a middle school teacher for 6 years and it's seemed like every year I've had to deal with administrative, HR, or just general issues. Every year I've had the mindset that I'll reach a point where I'll get past this and settle into my career, but with this being my third school and the pandemic being handled so badly, I'm starting to think this is just the reality of teaching. 

I just had my first baby in December. I was very nervous to go on maternity leave because, as we all know, it's so much harder to be out than it is to be in the classroom. I was super organized - I had six weeks of plans for each class written out to the day, all organized in a drive folder, along with tons of worksheets and busy work to supplement, plus scheduled assignments that would post on Google Classroom throughout the leave. I also made physical copies, left stacks on my desk, and labeled everything in my office with little sticky notes so anyone walking in would know what everything is. I shared this with my team and my administrators and the maternity leave sub. I told them not to hesitate to reach out to me if they needed anything. 

I spent the bulk of my leave not hearing anything from anyone. I reached out but just got messages like ""everything's fine, just focus on having that baby!"". I saw that the kids weren't completing my Google Classroom assignments, but with the constant reminders that ""everything was fine"", I figured they just found something else for the kids to work on. 

I'm now at the end of my leave, and I'm just now finding out that my administrators are saying that I didn't leave any plans. My coworkers are calling the kids ""feral"". I guess they've been allowed to play basketball and football in my room (I'm not the PE teacher) and they've been doing nothing for the past 2 months. What's worse is that my administrator reached out to the district and asked them to have other teachers in my content area from other schools send in plans because they ""weren't left with anything for the kids to do"". I was never contacted about any of this. 

I'm so upset and confused, because there's a paper trail of all of this. I still have the emails where I shared all of my plans and checked in with them. I don't know why they're pretending I didn't leave anything. I hate that the district and all of my colleagues at other schools now think I don't have my shit together.

1616078129.0,Screaming kid in the hallway,"Kid went by a few min ago screaming “I’m not doing fucking work all day”.  Sorry to break it to you, but that’s sort of how school works.  
Kid is 9.  He gets SIX 15-30 min breaks a day where he gets to nap, eat snacks, play games, color, etc.  He’s in the classroom maybe 2 hours actually working. 

He gets all of this because of “trauma”.  Been going on since kinder and it’s just getting worse. His teacher has been told to stop asking him to do things because “it makes him mad”.  

I am all for trauma informed care, but nothing is being done to help this kid learn to deal with and take responsibility for his actions.  I read somewhere that you’re not at fault for your mental illness but you are responsible for it, and I sort of feel the same about trauma. It’s not his fault but holy crap are we failing kids with all this crap.  

Just makes me sad and angry that over almost 5 years, this kid has not improved.

1588948384.0,One thing distance learning has proved to me is that online learning isn't for everyone.,"I teach 5th grade and we've been doing distance learning/e-learning since March 16th. My district was one of about 6-8 in my state that piloted the e-learning initiative last school year. We've used it a few times for hurricane days, which has been nice since we don't have to make up those days. But this is completely different.

One thing my superintendent has stated multiple times is that e-learning was never meant to be used for an extended period of time like this. Even with our ""waive weeks"" (one week of instruction, one week of catch up), it's obvious that e-learning will never replace true classroom instruction.

For some of my students, this hasn't phased them at all.  They are still making the same grades that they made while we were in physical school. Some of my straight A students, however, I've noticed are struggling. The ones who consistently pass every assignment we do in class are now failing or barely passing some of their assignments and it breaks my heart. They thrive and rely on that face to face instruction and guidance. The lack of that reflects in their grades and I hate it for them.

I know some who will ask why I'm grading and it's because our district has told us to grade. I'm grading with grace for pretty much everything, but they still have assessments that they're having to take (weekly math quiz, science video quizzes, etc.) They're able to use their notes that they had to take the day before, but I know some of them aren't.

The admin then says the same “less is more” empathetic copy-and-paste sentiment, all the while continuing to state their expectations that we assign 2-3 assignments per week, post at least 2 recorded lessons per week, hold at least 1 live chat per week, and take attendance with an open-ended question every day.

I don’t necessarily think the 2 assignments per week is a lot, but if parents are complaining about the workload then I feel like admin should either (1) change their requirements of the work we put out or (2) stop sending us these emails or actually determine which teachers (if any) are going overboard with assignments.

1594575702.0,What to do when a student dies,"It is one of those things that is obviously not taught in faculty, nor it seems, ever talked about apart from when it happens.  And it does happen.  Every teacher who has taught for any length of time will experience--sometimes with a current or former student, sometimes an alumnus you knew particularly well, and, worst of all, sometimes with a student you really and truly loved.
Every teacher knows at least one student they would happily adopt as their own child.  A kid who is so lovely, so promising, so fantastic a testament to youth and possibility--a kid who is the pride of their parents. A kid you were proud to have said you taught.  A kid you are now putting in the ground.

One of my very favourite people (not just student) was buried yesterday.  He was 21 years old. I had known him since he was 14, just starting grade 9 at a new school.  
I have taught for well over a decade, and this (unfortunately) is not the first time I have attended a funeral service for a student.  The very first was my very first year of praticum.  That child was five.  Cancer.  

It is awful to think of parents losing their child, and that happens to them once.  For teachers, it can happen over and over during their career*, and what is there for it?  I know in major events there is often grief counselling, but in the every day life of the every day teacher, it seems to be a grief we have to struggle with alone.  And worse, know will probably happen again during our lives as teachers. 

As I said, this is not the first death of a student I have weathered, but I still don't know what to do with that grief.  The surreality of burying a person so much younger than yourself, and the more horrible surreality of knowing it won't be the last time.  

As a teacher, new or veteran, it is an unfortunate truth of your career that not everyone you teach will outlive you.  Some will predecease you by years if not decades, and that is an incredibly harsh reality of the profession we have chosen.  A reality that is never mentioned.  

I don't know where I am going with this or what the point of it all is, I mean, I am still in the throes of major grief over this student's death... I guess maybe I just wanted to let young teachers out there know, grim or ghoulish as it might seem, that if you plan to remain in this profession for any length of time, to prepare yourself for this eventuality.  I'm not saying don't get close to people, don't let students touch your heart--of course not!  That is the main joy OF teaching, in my opinion, the chance to get to know and help mold these incredible human beings that you otherwise never would have met.   I always hoped to be a teacher that would have students who wanted to attend MY funeral.  I never considered the reverse. But in the midst of life we are in death, dark as that may seem, and not all of them will make it.  God, that's dark.

Enjoy them while you have them--be it four years or eight or twelve. They are your children, too, and it is ok to love them.  
And so very, very painful when you lose them.

--For Sid, with love.

*Please don't take this to mean I think teachers have it harder than parents who have lost a child.  I can't imagine anything worse, honestly.  I know for parents it is far worse.

Some pole turtle somewhere decided that teachers having a printer to share among every 4 classrooms was too much. 

We used to have one printer for every 4 teachers, and 2 larger copy machines for large jobs. Now our 70 person staff only has the 2 large copiers. 

As any member of this sub can tell you, those big copiers are down for maintenance or jammed a decent amount of the time. Now we have increased their demand by a huge amount so I don’t think their “uptime” will be better. 

Im all for reducing paper use and going digital on many things, but without touchscreen student devices that’s a big challenge. Also, it shouldn’t be a cold turkey thing. Tell us “hey in 3 years we are getting rid of the shared printers”.


Edit: I did bring in my own printer I’ve had since college. However, I shouldn’t have to. Also, I feel bad because my other teachers close by can’t really use it easily, but I did extend the offer to them if they need something printed they can email me. It’s a brother laser printer with ink that is like $35 for a 4 pack of off brand. I’m excited to have my own, but man if admin or IT makes me remove it… I’ll be really pissed.

TL;DR - I have a ton of stuff to do and no time to give 100 percent to any one of them.

I try very hard to be upbeat and supportive to the /community.  However, today was almost too much.

Background: I teach Latin.  I am the only Latin teacher in the district, and I do 8-12.  This means I am at two schools.

For the last three years, I have had a combined 2/3 class of students so I could take an ELA class (taught that for 15).  This is the third year in a row with a new ELA prep (American Lit. this year, so I am okay with it).

Now, the pandemic has made things interesting.  Rather than being able to use my Latin textbook from last year, which we did not come close to finishing, I am doing things virtual.  My Latin II class this year is using a program that is completely different from what I was doing.  I am scrambling like mad to scaffold, find assignments and make sure the students are successful.

However, it gets even more interesting.

I live in a rural area.  We are a Title 1 school.  A large number of my students lack home Internet and are being sent home to quarantine.  I have to compile work assignments for students in a class I know nothing about that is 100 percent virtual.  This includes all vocabulary, exercises, grammatical forms and the like.

It gets MORE interesting.

Parents are deciding to pull their kids out and keep them at home.  Some, fortunately, have Internet.  These I am not overly concerned with.  However, those who are pulled out indefinitely will need a constant stream of work sent home, completed and returned. 

When a student is pulled out of school, they are changed on my rosters.  In two classes, I have eight, yes, eight, different rosters that seem to change daily.  When a student is put back into school, they go on a roster.  I have to find and manually move grades over.

The MOST interesting part of the whole ordeal.

I am at two schools.  I have one planning period for travel, lunch and planning.  The drive is not bad >10 minutes. 

So, in my brief time that I have for planning, I have to:

1. Prepare ahead for four preparations;
2. Plan for remote learners and in person learners;
3. Set up Google meets and times;
4. Collect, and grade work for learners without home Internet;
5. Keep up with grades from continually shifting rosters;
6. Call parents about students with failing grades;
7. And all of the other fun documentation that I do!

Anyway, I really did not want to vent, but today, along with today being my mother's birthday, whom I lost in May to the virus, was just a bit much.

Thanks for reading.  I promise to return to being supportive later.

I let it all out.  Including, as I forgot to day yesterday, the continuous drop of connectivity I have on the classroom computer.

She was very sympathetic and noted the system we have in place was designed around approximately 300 students.  That number is 750+ and changing constantly.

A change, for the better, is on the horizon.  This will ameliorate considerable stress for me and allow an opportunity to get ahead.

We were doing a scavenger hunt on Thursday, and I had one student not doing his work, distracting others, running around the room, and throwing stuff. After I told him multiple times to stop and do his work, I finally walked over to my desk, pulled up his mom’s phone number on my laptop, and called her: “Hi, this is Mr. LavaSlushy calling from (school name) how are you today?…I’m (student name’s) math teacher and we’re in class right now doing a scavenger hunt, and (student name) is throwing stuff across the room, running around, distracting others and not doing his work. I’m having a hard time getting through to him, can you talk to him for me?”
Her: Yes sir put him on
Me: (student name), phone
After they get done talking, I thank her and we hang up. He got his paper and got to work. I did the same phone call for another student who was doing the same thing and I got the same response from the other parent.

Friday I had two girls sitting in the back of the room and after multiple chances to stop talking so much and get their work done, I decided to move one of them and she said “No, I’m not moving my seat. I’m staying right here”. I told her if she didn’t move she’d get lunch detention. She said “Okay I’ll have lunch detention”. I walk over to my desk and open my laptop and start typing an email to admin about it. She then says “Are you going to tell my mom too?”. At this point, she’s more concerned about her mom being notified than the actual lunch detention. I call her mom and say “Hi, this is Mr. LavaSlushy calling from (school name) how are you today?…I’m (student name’s) math teacher and we’re in class right now and (student name) is getting too distracted talking to her friend and not getting her work done.

I typicallg work 12 hour days and I am in such a state of despair. My mental health is practically non existent. I have panic attacks daily just thinking about going to school, and I have even had a few in front of the kids and had to have people take over for me. Even on weekends I can’t sleep becausr I’m dreading Monday. There have been times where I wished I could get hit by a car on my way just so I didn’t have to go. I know if I leave I will be disappointing so many people but I just don’t see how I can live like this for the entire year. To make matters worse, we are short staffed as someone else quit a few weeks ago.

Also, the kids are so disrespectful no matter what strategy I try. They call me names, steal from me, ruin my things, and some have hit me. I constantly ask for advice and spend my entire weekends and nights trying to think of new ways and nothing seems to work. I just do t know what to do anymore. Does anyone have advice on whether I should stick it out or just give in and quit?",teaching
1612031415.0,Teaching in urban areas and white savior complex,"Hello fellow educators , this post will be about some social and political issues and if you are uncomfortable with conversations about race keep scrolling. If you are offended by what I say I am so sorry and please send me a private message so we can hash it out. I am only writing from my own experience and limited knowledge! 

My current position is working with Baltimore’s vulnerable youth and the majority of our students are black. I struggle because as a staff there is only about 20% people of color, and maybe 2% of us are from Baltimore if any? I want to help these students so bad, I love them, I believe in them. But sometimes I feel so out of my element, which is often good but also who am I as a white woman to tell these kids how to act. I don’t know what a day in their community looks like. I don’t what it feels like to grow up poor and black in Baltimore. I’m trying to educate myself, but Know that this program would be more beneficial coming from the students community members. We’re funded by John Hopkins university and I wonder why John Hopkins Is funding An outdoor school in Northeast MD and not schools and organizations in Baltimore city run by people from Baltimore. 

Many of current 6th grade students read at a second grade level or lower. I sat with an extremely intelligent student who still struggled with reading words like cake and cause. She did really well when I patiently sat with her and it was soon apparent she was dyslexic. Are you getting help for this in school I asked? “Well they just put me in a special ed class” another student I was helping (6th grade) was struggling with fractions and when I drew out a number line for her it seemed as though she had never seen fractions before or never had someone make her accountable for really looking at them. I am blown away by how much Baltimore schools are struggling. How high the turn over rate is in teachers, how much the students seem to be just passed along, the lack of support these students because of the lack of support these teachers have. I am reminded of my privilege on a daily basis. 

I recently interviewed for teach for America and the last question was how will you contribute to ending racial inequality in schools across America. Wow. How will I as a single white woman end racial inequality in schools when our societies are so deeply flawed. I was deeply bothered by this question but said I would provide an equal education for all of my students in my classroom. how I would meet them where they’re at, not let them fall behind, make sure they believed in themselves. I would make damned sure these kids knew how to read and I would be asking everyday to make sure their hierarchy or needs were being met. Later I wonder if should have said I would learn from the educators of color around me. That I would ask them how to best use my privilege to help these students. To ask them what they need from me. That I would advocate for my students of color to later become teachers to represent their communities. 79% of teachers in this country are white and communities are underrepresented! 

I don’t want to be a savior but I want love and support my students who need it most to the best of my ability. I am also conflicted about TFA but also need an alternative teacher certification program bc I can’t flip the bill for grad school. 

Edit: The program i am currently working for is a nonprofit boarding school targeted to assist at risk students during covid-19. Students in all 6th grade classes in public schools in Baltimore city are  individually selected from their teachers, generally about 1-5 per school as students who would greatly benefit from the program. Many are housing insecure, have parents in institutions, or have very challenging behaviors. They are generally just students who wouldn’t succeed in virtual learning. Before March I was working in outdoor education specifically in urban areas and fell in love but my bachelors is in Biology and in the surrounding states you have to have a bachelors in education to get your teaching certification, which is why I was looking to TFA for alternate certification because I cant afford grad school on my own rn.",teaching

All students are supposed to be dismissed by 4:20 and teachers are allowed to leave then. I work at a school with a 9-4:20 schedule unlike most that start earlier, which is important to note because the more time that is added onto our day means the more rush hour traffic you hit on the way home (and I live in the suburbs of DC, so it’s awful. My team finally reached out to admin about it and suggested that a few teachers opt to stay late and get paid for the extra hour/week that it takes for buses to arrive, and they hit us with the classic “Don’t you care about the children?” response, saying that the students are our priority and we “have to keep them safe.” Meanwhile, neighboring districts are implementing week-long breaks in November for teachers’ mental health. Oh but don’t worry, they’re having snacks in the lounge tomorrow which obviously solves everything :))) 

I am only a first-year teacher and I know this issue pales in comparison with other schools. But I’m finally starting to see how teachers are constantly exploited for their compassion and expected to carry out ESSENTIAL functions of our job outside of contract hours with no compensation, and I just don’t know if going to another school/district would solve this problem or if I need to find a new career altogether.",teaching

I am 35 weeks pregnant with our first child. I have been teaching math at the same high school for 6 years and loving it. Right when I was pregnant, I told the school and the district office that they need to find a sub for me. I will be missing 3 weeks and final exams. I told them I would follow contract and create 2 weeks of planning and then the long term sub can do the rest... well that is not the case... I was informed today that I need to plan everything for the rest of the year because the sub doesn't know how to do math... I teach Algebra 1 and 2 and am very frustrated that they couldn't get someone with ANY math skills.

My building principal told me today that I need to create notes, worksheets, quizzes, and the finals before I have my baby... WHICH COULD BE ANYDAY NOW! AND he told me I need to record a video of me teaching all of the notes so the students don't fall behind and so the sub doesn't have to.

My sub reached out to me and reminded me how he doesn't understand math and that ""technology is hard for this old fella"" BUT HE HAS TO GRADE THE FINAL, SUBMIT FINAL GRADES, AND SUBMIT FINAL EXAM GRADES ON OUR ONLINE GRADEBOOK. I just see this going horribly.

I have talked to my union rep and she said that COVID made it impossible to find subs so there isn't much I can do. She said I could just follow contract and do 2 weeks of planning, and that I wouldn't get in trouble...

Both teachers reported to me that she was rolling her eyes all class at everything they said and not following directions. Mom on the phone basically flipped out and told me ""what do I care what a student is doing with their eyes? whats wrong with it?""

I had an unannounced 90 minute observation yesterday.  The notes I got were horrendous.  
I am teaching hybrid (13 in person, 9 online simultaneously).  We’ve been hybrid for a month. The first half of the year was completely remote. 
Some of the highlights were that I was “fluctuating between the in class kids and the computer kids” (um
Yea.  That’s how it works.  Don’t get the choice of words though...)
That kids didn’t raise their hands enough (there was some calling out but it was a discussion & I wasn’t concerned).  I have the toughest group in the building (as mentioned by the rest of the staff). 
There were so many negative things he pointed out.  It was truly disheartening.  He said the floor was messy (we have art in the room and the teacher ran over her time- so they hadn’t cleaned up yet).  
He commented on the fact that all of my “polices and procedures” are not listed or posted on the wall.  And that one kid got pissy and put his head down on his desk.  (I’ll take that over an outburst any day). He also noted that three kids were on their computers (which is seen as a negative- yet it’s required for the math program we have.) 

No mention of the fact that we just started working on some new things and the last two days have been the best my kids have had since we’ve been back.  No mention of the fact that a kid that has outbursts almost daily had an amazing day with his new “work for chart”.  No mention that the kids were excited about their math skills. 
Did he not see same lessons I saw?  The kids were working, answering questions, working on multiplication and getting excited that they got it. We were quietly laughing and joking a bit.  They all handed in their work, aside from one kid.  Then for reading they did a great job with learning how to use a new reading notebook. They came up with great points about the character from our mentor text .  They took notes and shared their ideas.

I'm getting emails with multiple sentences in the Subject line, and way too many had no clue what a URL was.  They have used Google Classroom for a couple years, but they act like it's completely foreign too!

I think we expect them to just know how to use it because they grew up with this technology, but I don't think most of mine have ever been explicitly taught!

1648096532.0,I got fired today.,"Well technically, they called it something else, but honestly they fired me. So storytime.

I am in a grad school program to get my credential completely. I was hired the last week of January and started the first week of February.

My first week I was shadowing the sub that had been in the classroom since October. The kids were really attached to her and I understand that. I did my best my second week to establish my rules and create an environment for learning. I used the curriculum they provided and worked with other teachers to get ideas to motivate the students to work with me. I worked with other teachers to build lesson plans, because this is my first time teaching. I honestly feel as though I did the best I could. But, many students were unruly and unfocused. They are often out of their seats.

I have only been in the position for a month. I have read all the studies, used all the tricks of not starting the lesson until the kids are paying attention. I've written names on the board. I've called home. I've had parent meetings. I've done everything I can think of to get the kids on task and learning. 

Yet, I've been told the environment is not conducive to them and that it is my fault for making it this way. For not asking for enough help. For not placing my foot down harder. For not being the teacher they need at this moment. I feel so lost and I feel like I am just not a good enough teacher. I just wish I was there longer.",teaching

Now as summer dwindles, every day I cycle between rage and a despair. Every email from admin. Every discussion with my department. 

Our school district is doing remote learning K-5 and hybrid for 6-12. Around 40% of the latter population have opted for completely remote instruction rather than the hybrid model. 

As a special content teacher (and the only one at that) I have 5 different preps. I just don't know how I'm going to do it. We were just told as well that we don't have enough chromebooks for all the remote learners and that we may need to give up our district issued laptops. It's a week until school and they're still doing student schedules. We have conference days Thursday and Tuesday which include large in-person full staff meetings. Another local district just quararantined 41 staff after an exposure at a staff meeting. 

Lots of school districts around us are going fully remote due to budget problems. We were told if we go fully remote, we will still need to report to the building to teach because we are essential employees. When our admin was asked if anything can be done for teachers and childcare, their response was to laugh.

1611848827.0,Thoughts on student teachers and pay?,"Edit: Wow, I didn't expect this many comments! I can't give you all the replies you deserve, but I did give upvotes. Thank you all for the support and shared frustration (and for those who disagreed, the respectful way you did so)!

Hi everyone - I just wanted to share a (potentially unpopular) opinion and see what thoughts everyone else has on this. This is probably mostly rant, and for that I do apologize.

For context, I'm a student teacher right now working to get my license to teach HS. Myself and a few student teachers I know put in 40+ hours a week towards our internships (grading, planning, teaching, attending meetings, all that fun stuff). We are also told to avoid working as much as possible to focus on our internships.

I completely understand how having a job is just added stress - I moved my own work schedule to work 12 hr shifts on the weekends to free up my weekdays but also pay my bills, because I'm also an adult who lives on their own. However, I do feel that if we are going to be asked to not work, we should at least recieve a stipend of some sorts.

Do we deserve full pay? Absolutely not. I am not licensed and the teacher I'm under is still carrying me through this, working just as hard (especially during COVID). I recognize and understand that I'm not a ""real"" teacher yet, so getting full pay would be absolutely ridiculous. Again, though - I am teaching, planning, supporting my kids, attending the meetings, and doing all of the teacher things, for free. I'm appreciative of the opportunity and I adore teaching, but believe student teaching being a paid internship would be fair.

(I also recognize that there's no way in Hades that a state/school/district would ever support this, but I needed to rant to someone other than my poor husband).",teaching

1679006106.0,My admin is enabling a violent student,"I have no idea what to do. There is a student in my school who is now in 2nd grade. He has been known to be violent and disruptive since Kindergarten. This year, he has choked students, made shanks, thrown chairs, ran away from school and into a storm gutter in the street, and more. However, there are absolutely no consequences for him...ever. We're not allowed to call the SRO for him and our principal has chased him when he ran and just puts him right back in class when anything happens. I had tried intervening at the beginning of the year but got wrote up and it was put on my summative assessment. He also has a ""team"" with a special education teacher, school psych, mental health professional, principal, student services coordinator, teachers, and parents. 

Tuesday he beat up another student. Nothing was done as a consequence. The parents of the victim found out and are now asking the school questions. Admin is asking teachers what happened and saying she didn't know he was violent. Turns out Mom is a teacher at another school and Dad is a school resource officer for the district and they are not happy. Teacher is now blaming the teachers saying they didn't report all of the violent incidents he has had nor followed the ""procedure"" which is call the office or a special education teacher to handle it. However, when the fight happened, the specials teacher (which is where it happened) had tried calling 4 different people before I answered my phone.

1600621067.0,Resources that helped me become a better teacher,"(those are in no particular order)

1. Teach Like a Champion 2.0 by Doug Lemov. This is the newest addition to my collection. The book is based on analysis and comparison of 'good' teachers and their techniques and distills those observations into techniques and skills teachers can apply in the classroom. The book touches on Tracking students understanding, lesson planning and the use of questions (and more).  I have found the book to be highly valuable for myself because it focuses on, and is build on actual applications in the classroom, as opposed to some of the other books i read over the years, which focus on some theory and no application to the classroom.
2. Cognitive Load theory by Sweller, Ayres and Kalyuga. This is among the very few books about pure theory that i actually referred back to over the years. There are many papers publicly available that do a much better job introducing into the theory than i can do, so i wont go into it here. What i can tell you though is that this book finally presented me with something i was in desperate need for in college: a connection between theory and application. The main value of this book is found in its deep analysis of the way students learn and interact with new topics. Sweller et al did a remarkable job applying their theory to the teaching profession and came up with major implications for the way students interact with instructional content.
3. The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Now, im not a physicist. I wont claim to have any idea about physics. Thats also not why i invested into these books (at \~200 bucks a piece, thats quite the investment). Richard Feynman is widely considered as one of the best explainers of the 20 century. As someone who deeply struggled with giving reasonable explanations of new topics to students, i studied his books not for the physics, but for the way he teaches them. His focus on concepts, building prior knowledge before he confronts you with the math, and overall skill to relate ideas in a way thats both easy to follow and also allows you to grasp big connections is something i admire to this day. 
4. How i wish i taught math, by Craig Barton. I originally bought this book to help me get better at teaching math in an after school program for high school kids with failing grades. Initial impressions went along the lines of: great, this is another useless book full of generic advice. Well let me tell you that could not have been further from the truth. The book is overall presented as a report. The author has done substantial amounts of research into the field of psychology, and adapted those into his math lessons in school. Each chapter focuses on a different idea, and is structured pretty much the same way: theory first, followed by implications for the classroom, followed by experiences with the theory applied in the class room. Even though the author teaches high school math, its really a book about psychology. And it does a great job bridging the gap between theory and reality.
5. Mastery by Robert Greene. Not at all a book about teaching or education. Its one of those esoteric, generic pseudo science books. Its written awfully presumptuous, and has the general: i have found something amazing - attitude about it. But i love it. I love it for the perspective it takes on things. The book is a summary/ an analysis of famous people, that have achieved great things, and tries to generalize principles from this. I love the underlying message: hard work pays off. I regularly do lessons with the book - mostly at the beginning of the school year - where i set expectations for the students. And i made amazing progress by doing so. 
6. The subtle Art of not giving a f\*\*k, by Mark Manson. This book was recommended to me when i first went into therapy because i could not handle the amount of stress i was under. It definitely changed my life. I am comfortable to say that, without this book, i would not be where i am today. The book goes through a number of different concepts of dealing with social situations, one of which is to focus on the things you can influence and are responsible for. This single insight alone has helped me tremendously over the last \~3 years, and made me an overall better teacher. 
7.  Eddie Woo's Youtube Channel. Along the lines of what i wrote about Richard Feynman, i trouble with explaining things simply. I watched a number of people on youtube explain stuff, none of them (in my mind) did it better than Eddie Woo. To me, hes a prime example of teaching with a positive attitude while also giving rigorous, easy to understand explanations.",teaching
1460589738.0,Arrested in front of my class.,"Today was going good. I had a fantastic lesson planned for my 7th grade civics class. They have been learning all about the Supreme Court and all the different interesting cases. One of them is **Miranda v. Arizona.**

Being the tricky teacher I am, I wanted to make it as memorable for them as possible (especially considering they have to pass a State EoC Exam). I had the whole class ready to go, working on the bell ringer on the 6th Amendment, being the great kids they are. When SUDDENLY I get a knock at my door.

There stands the school resource officer. ""Mr. Gameguy360, I am afraid you need to come with me, there's a **warrant out for your arrest.** For unpaid traffic violations."" She grabs my hands and handcuffs me! She was so ruff, I stutter not know what to say, my whole class looked on as their paragon of a model citizen is handcuffed.

""You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney, if you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you. **Kids, a sub will be in here shortly.**""

With my hands behind my back, I tell them how sorry I am... that they are totally going to remember me as the teacher, that without fail, will never be able to watch cops the same way again. Additionally, that they will defently be able to answer all the relevant question about Miranda Rights / Miranda Warning on the EoC.

1607455097.0,I'm sick of our garbage school board.,"Our school board has been mulling over the possibility of returning high school kids to what they're calling 'Plan A,' where three groups of students rotate coming to school, one week at a time. 

This, of course, as our numbers explode. Every metric in the red on their local dashboard. >10% positivity. 

At the last school board meeting, they said they were still looking to advance despite community spread because statistically, kids are 'not as likely' to spread/die from the disease. (Never mind that this statistic is heavily skewed by the fact that we closed every school back in March, so the kids have effectively been in quarantine for nine months while the parents are out and about.) 

WHAT ABOUT THE TEACHERS?? Last I checked, we're adults who are perfectly capable of giving COVID to each other, or to your kids. You can't act like the kids are the only ones going back in the building. They really can't be this stupid.

ETA 12/9: Last night they had another board meeting. TL;DR: They moved us back to remote learning for another month, but sports are still in-person (everyone knows football players are immune to COVID, right?).

I wish I could give this young man a shout-out by name, but at that meeting, the Student Representative (who's on his school's debate team, as it happens) delivered his argument in a more well-spoken, clear, and concise manner than any of the adults on the board. As he put it, the comments by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield about prioritizing school reopening were taken out of context. In context, as he put it, once we've closed bars, movie theaters, and everything else to prevent community spread, *then* we should prioritize school reopening. If we open schools now alongside everything else (this was my favorite part), **school spread will mirror community spread**.

1627591666.0,"Reminder for new and veteran teachers ahead of the school year: Establish clear, succinct expectations and stick to them.","I see this a lot and most of you know this, but I love the start of a new year because it allows me to correct mistakes I made my previous year.

The one lesson I focus on to improve myself year in and year out is to stick to my expectations closer than the previous year. Obviously flexibility is necessary and required in many instances, but flexibility can be an expectation.

I was reading a post on r/amitheasshole and it was a professor who went back and forth on being rigid and then flexible and didn't understand why it wasn't yielding positive outcomes.

If you have a million rules, you're not doing it right. Kids can't remember 20 things. I have four rules:

1) Respect me. Most stuff fits in that and every once in a while, I'll have to explain why something was disrespectful, but most kids understand that.

2) Respect your classmates. This spans from taking stuff, being rude, interrupting etc. Easy enough

3) Respect the staff, including cafeteria, custodial staff etc. If they know you respect custodians, they don't just sweep or throw trash on the floor. They don't make the bridge in their mind that someone has to clean it up cause their parents pick up after them. You make that bridge for them.

4) Respect yourselves. I tell the students they each deserve respect and should demand it from me and others. This is a bit abstract, but I usually go on at the start of the year that I'll respect them, but I need help doing so. If something is going on at home, let me know as much as they can and I can work with them. They're individual humans, not little underlings and they will be treated as humans. This means that they're not just someone's kids and it creates a sense of personal ownership for actions and responsibilities.

And it's a sneaky way to let them know I care and love them. If you establish the expectation that you love what you do and want to support their success, they're more likely to embrace that.

For other stuff, have clear cut policies and don't make exceptions unless for extraordinary cases. Assignments are due by a certain time, but the moment you start taking one or two late, you'll start having other students expecting them to get away with it. Kids love taking a mile, so make sure they understand what an inch is in your classroom.

Good luck to all, and try to make it to Thanksgiving before you start saying ""Fuck this.""",teaching

1596203194.0,My district just announced our reopening plans and I’m proud of how they’re handling things!,"I teach in a bigger city in a state that is catching flack for how our governor is handling the situation, so needless to say I was worried about our reopening plan. 

However, my school had a staff meeting over Zoom yesterday to discuss the specifics, and I am so relieved because it feels like they really put thought and consideration into what data and science has said about this!! 

Essentially, our plan looks like this:

Phase One: Completely virtual. Teachers have the option to teach remotely from their classrooms, with mandatory temperature checks before they enter the building and the expectation that they do not congregate. 

Phase Two: K-3 comes back Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Wednesdays our building is shut down for mandatory sanitization. Students are required to wear masks and desks are to be at least 3 feet apart.

Phase Three: 4-6 comes back into the building. There are two groups: one is in the building Monday and Thursday, the other is Tuesday and Friday. The building is still shut down for sanitization on Wednesdays. 

Phase Four: For high school. 9-12 comes back hybrid. 

Phase Five: 100% back in person. This phase is back to “normal” and may not be achieved this year. 

Some general info for all phases:

- We will not start going back in person until cases have been declining for two weeks in a row.
- Students will be required to get their temperature checked before entering the building.
- Bathrooms will have signs that indicate whether or not they have been sanitized (therein letting teachers know if it’s okay for their class to use or not).
- Water fountains will not be running (however my school has hydration stations and students will all be provided with a water bottle).
- Breakfasts will be “grab and go”. Students will take one and then eat in their classroom. 
- Lunches will be passed out, and there will be no “lunch line”. Students will maintain a 6 ft distance sitting at lunch tables and only one grade will be in the lunch room at a time. 

There was an information overload when we went through this meeting yesterday so this is the generalized version and I am probably missing something, however it makes me feel comforted that our plan is so extensive!! I really feel like we covered all of our bases.",teaching

1613801147.0,TEA gave every school in the state of Texas 3 free bad weather days that we wouldn't have to make up at the end of the year. My district didn't take any of them.,"I'm a first year teacher in a small school located in West Texas. As most everyone has heard by now, Texas was hit with an insane snow storm that has caused water outages, rolling blackouts due to an energy crisis, and many deaths across the state. The area I live in has had a consistent 6+ inches of snow on the ground for an entire week (which is record breaking in Texas). The roads have been iced over and slushy at best. People in the surrounding area have lost power and/or water in these extreme low temps.

Due to this extreme weather, TEA gave everyone 3 free bad weather days so that we could stay home and stay safe. But what did my school do? Made everyone come in at 8:00 for a full day of school on Tuesday morning after Presidents day and drive through the ice and snow. Not even a late start!! So then, when we get news that we're next on the list of possible blackouts to conserve power, the school tells us we'll have a late start on Wednesday and we'll only go home if the power is off for more than an hour. Well that's great! We only have to freeze our butts off for an hour before we get to go home. So the snowmageddon continues, but we never lose power (thankfully, but the weather was still horrible) and administration decides we don't need a late start for Thursday, so come on in at 8:00 again! It's not like the roads are even slushier than before due to the melting and refreezing that's been occurring for the past week! Today was the first day that the sun actually came out and I didn't have to pry my garage door open just to get to school on time. We could have stayed home and stayed safe Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and NEVER have to make up those days and then showed up on Friday when it was warm and safe!!! Literally every other school in a hundred mile radius closed for at least one day and most did late starts for the rest.

And to top it all off, when one of my fellow teachers asked my principal why we weren't using the free bad weather days, he said he'd never heard of those until she mentioned them.

I couldn't even ask for more.

But still, no matter how perfect it is, everyday, as I sit on my chair, I still think about those times I stood in front of my students, walked around the classroom, confidently discussing the lessons, seeing my students actively raising their hands, hearing their laughters and all.

Currently we are on lunch break and I’m just feeling so so so defeated this year. I feel like a terrible teacher, I feel like my poor firsties are going to go to second grade unprepared. I feel like I’m doing everything I can, but still not enough. 

It’s so frustrating to be a teacher because the pressure is insane— a lot of people don’t realize this. The pressure to move kids further along academically, even amongst ALL OF THE BARRIERS WE ARE EXPERIENCING. Like come on and give me a break here. Internet issues, connection, digital exhaustion, parent schedules and availability, lack of resources, and just the fact that we are still experiencing and trying to survive through a pandemic here!!! It’s all so tough to navigate and while I know it’s out of my control somehow it still seems like I’m at fault. ON TOP OF THE SHIT PAY. I mean come on. I feel like I work my life away sometimes for the barest of the bare minimum. From admin, parents, hell even my own friends and family still think I’m a babysitter. It’s infuriating because I think to myself: do you want to work that hard and burn yourself out year after year after year just to be paid shit and at the same time be looked down on by society?? I’m not looking for praise, just respect. I feel like we deserve more, so much more. It just doesn’t seem like it’s worth the mental strain, the constant scrutiny, the constant criticism from those that have NO IDEA what’s it’s like to be us. 

I’m in my 3rd year and I’m already questioning how much more I can take. I’m not sure this profession is even good for my mental health at this point. It sucks because this is what I wanted my WHOLE life (in 1st grade I decided I was gonna do this) and now I’m wondering why I didn’t choose a different path. I LOVE the kids and the bonds, my coworkers are great, but at some point burn out really does set in. This is not to discourage pre-service teachers either. Fight the good fight for sure, I’m just tired man. Just tired. I’m all over the place. I guess I just needed to say that. Would love some words of encouragement or positivity.

1600115767.0,Even a great teacher can only get you so far...,"i recently came across multiple instances of myself thinking: why is everything always the teachers fault? As far as i remember, literally all the theories about learning tell us, that learning takes active participation of the designated learner. In other words, if that only somewhat useful collection of atoms that we call students wont actually do anything, the teacher cant change that. its the teacher's job to ensure the student as adequate amount of opportunities to learn, but the actual learning has to be done by the student. 

That actually leads me to one development i feel kinda iffy about. Im all for accessibility of education, but not at the cost of actually removing the necessary work to be done for it. I actually believe that standards are too low, and should be adjusted upwards. But then again, that would require actually investing into education to get the necessary qualified teachers to accompany that. Picture big eye roll here.",teaching

We are all virtual.

The school wants me to call home to everyone and 'sell' the idea of how important it is for the kids to be in school. Which I will… it is my job… I am being bad by not doing it. The head teacher did it in my department.

But I really just don't care anymore. I feel like if they don't attend class it's their fault. They do one assignment a week for a grade, the rest I don't grade. We can't give participation grades to the kids who have computers.

I am just upset and ready for the year to end. I don't want to call parents in get into a 'they should be in class' discussion. I am a first year teacher and my notes on in class attendance are poor anyways. I feel like I have to put a ton of time into lesson design -- which is what I want to do -- and then I'm supposed to put even more time into 'convincing' families to attend virtual school, and I don't want to do deal with people anymore or put up with random parents drama and life trauma.

Am venting but advice welcomed. I'm going to write a script and stick to it as best I can. I wish I could just give participation grades instead of having to talk people into attending school.

“Play is children’s language. They act out pretend scenarios as a way to express concerns, ask questions, and, crucially, reshape a narrative. In a pretend scenario, children are driving the plot and can change the outcome of a scary situation or try out different solutions to a problem.” — Kate Cray",teaching

He’s the source of at least 15% of our problems at the entire school.  Today he was being annoying and disruptive as usual and when I told him to stop, he just said “that’s fine, I just won’t come to this class tomorrow” (do you promise?) and I responded with “that’s fine, I can just give you a referral for ditching.” He responded with “so? I can’t get kicked out cause I have an IEP.”  

This kid CONSTANTLY uses his IEP to try and get out of class, to go to the bathroom whenever he wants, to get out of work and to generally cause problems.  His IEP is for ADHD…I’m sorry; but that’s just not a reason for these kinds of rules.  ADD/ADHD is a problem of course (I was diagnosed with ADD back in HS too, but learned coping mechanisms and didn’t use it as an excuse) but to give kids these kinds of excuses is inexcusable.  For this kid alone, I’m supposed to fill out a daily assignment report despite the fact that it’s all posted on Google Classroom and I’m supposed to give him all kinds of additional accommodations and the kid doesn’t even care about his education.  His mom obviously doesn’t either because she has trained him to use the IEP excuse at every turn.   

Sorry for the rant, but I believe SPED should be reserved only for kids who actually need it.  An IEP should be a rare thing, not 35% of my class.  And the whole “can’t be kicked out” thing needs to be gone.  If a kid is being considered for expulsion, it’s probably for the benefit for many kids, and that kid needs to learn that their actions have consequences.

After that, things got better and I noticed my heart racing throughout the day so I took steps to calm myself and also I was better at classroom management. The last few years though I still felt like my workload was constantly heavy which made me feel stressed a lot. Throughout the years, I would sleep a ton , randomly take naps, and didn't have much energy for anything but teaching. I didn't feel like i enjoyed my after work hours much because I was too exhausted to do anything other than pass out on my couch and get take-out.

I love teaching and being with the kids but I feel a lot healthier now. I enjoy my hours after work. My work hours are not bad, sometimes jam-packed but I'm able to complete more during my work hours.

1600008270.0,I read yet another useless book by a professor claiming to have all the answers,"So, i recently finished my study of Jo Boalers work on the application of the idea of a growth mindset to the field of mathematics. And as much as i like to read new stuff, i feel like this was a waste of time & money.

The book's felt like one of those traditional bashes on current teaching methods you read about all too often lately. They fell in line of repeating the same pattern as any other critique of modern education:

1. whats done today is wrong
2. i did a study / experiment where i implemented system X and it changed everyone's life and problems
3. my way of doing things is right, because Person Y said so - oh and by the way i found a completely unrelated study to back my claim.
4. Based on my theory, here are the changes you should make

Now, listen. I like to read different peoples opinions and perspective on things, and maybe take a few things i find useful for my own. But i've been turned away recently by all the complaining and the lack of concrete solutions. I like the idea of creating a positive mindset in class, but i dont need some pseudo research telling me thats good. Thats just basic logic. I also dont need yet another collection of tasks, where im slapped with the description and a bunch of stories of what amazing things people have done with this work.

I would like for once to read a book, that either focuses on one small aspect - but does so in a thorough manner, or to read a book presenting a theory and actually arguing why their stuff is better, not just throw it in there and ask me to accept it.",teaching
1681824738.0,Can't run my women in STEM club due to complaints from parents,"I have been running a women in STEM club at my school to allow the girls who don't usually enjoy these subjects the chance to attend some fun trips and potentially see themselves as engineers etc rather than the usual jobs they tend to go for and increase interest in physics and maths primarily which was also a reason this school brought me in. 

I have now since been told after 9 months that running this club is sexist and it won't be allowed to carry on unless all boys are also allowed to come to the group. There is already a regular STEM club that everyone can attend that has just ended up with only boys bothering to go, now that we have a friendly environment for the girls they are not content to just leave it be. Complaints from the boys (who are obsessed with Andrew Tate as well) and their parents has led to this situation.

I am torn on what to do, if I keep running the group the girls won't wish to attend any more when the boys start to come with the aim of ruining it, but if I just stop running this club then it looks like sour grapes and I'm not giving the girls the opportunity to go on the trips and classes that I wanted them to have.

1605211042.0,How I train my students to think logically even without telling them.,"Teaching any of the things to the students is not that easy, especially maths. Students should have the interest and the thinking brain to master that subject. As teachers, we can teach calculations and equations, but we can't teach how to think. The only thing we can do is showing the path. For that recently I started to give very unique and uncommon logic problems in the middle of the class. And I give them like 2-3 minutes to try. And I ask hands up if they know the solution. That is to give recognition to those who solve it in the class. That helps to encourage others to do the same in next day. And after that, I teach them how to solve the problem in step by step. This whole thing may take 5-7 minutes from your class but I am witnessing a big difference from my students.

Here are some problems I used in my class. I recommend you to start with this little funny problem. This was a wonderful problem for my students and they really enjoyed it.

1544468236.0,"Even though teaching has been a joy and an adventure, I am leaving teaching. I work too much for too little pay.","This is more of a vent. 

I'm sorry if this post is off-putting to many, but I need to get this off my chest.

I've been teaching for 6 years. I'm relatively young (late twenties) and there are many aspects of my job that I love. I love that everyday is different. I love that I get to interact with so many wonderful young minds and develop meaningful student-mentor relationships with them. I love my supportive admin. I love that I get to teach at the AP level. I love that I get to blend education and technology in my teaching in creative ways. I love that my students love my classes (it took a lot of work to get to this point.)

&#x200B;

But I have to leave.

&#x200B;

I live in one of the most expensive areas of the United States (Hint: tech companies, foggy weather, Teslas, etc.) and it's still a major struggle even to make a living as a teacher in its most remote cities. I have a bachelor's, a master's, and 6 years of non-stop work experience, and I can't afford to live. 

Also, even after 6 years of trying to perfect my craft as an educator I still haven't gotten the work-life balance down. I know this might be harder as an English teacher, but through technology and more efficient pedagogical methods I've reduced my workload significantly over the years. But it's not enough. I still take work home everyday, and I'm always behind. Meanwhile, I see my contemporaries leave their workplaces and think nothing about their job while at home. As an introvert, I can only dream of having this luxury.

&#x200B;

I'm leaving teaching. 

I've already updated my resume. I've built my portfolio. I've started collecting Letters of Rec. And I'm going to find a job that does not involve teaching at a school. I'm going to find a job that I feel pays me what I'm worth, while allowing me to live a life that I can manage without slowly deteriorating my physical, emotional, and mental well-being. 

I'm sorry if I sound selfish, or perhaps even like a douchebag. 

But I don't know where else to vent this. I'm afraid of sharing this with my friends or family because I feel like they'll be disappointed in me. But I'll get there eventually.

1675532391.0,How is this real life?,"I (29 F) have a student who was transferred into my class because they were acting out in a male (40s) class. They believed having a female teacher, younger would be more supportive. The student has triggers with middle aged men that I’m not privy to. 

No big deal at first, he is a bright kid. Does the bare minimum. But then, a few weeks go by and he does nothing anymore. Headphones, Netflix (uses a VPN to bypass school wifi), very social but zero participation. 

I make “deals” (picking and choosing my battles), and offer incentives for him to get some of his work done. From social worker, guidance, principal and parents, I’m hailed as his favorite teacher, he puts me on a pedestal, all great sounding things. 

Except when he goes into full manic episode in my class on a few occasions. The latest - rather than security taking him to someone’s office for help, they brought him back to class. Where he was confrontational, swearing, and got in my face. Another student stood up and his response was to try to defend me as my manic student was about to hit me. 

I deescalated the situation, but it was F this, F that, bizarre behavior. Yelling, slamming, and extremely theatrical. But no one was working anymore and for 45 min it was keeping him at bay. Most students were mortified by the looks on their faces. 

I have a somewhat self-educated background in mental health with a family member so I know what psychosis looks like. 

Family is fully involved and supportive, district wants to get this kid help, they’ve tried to get the student into a mental health program with local medical center but he was denied because they said he needs more help than they can provide, but yet still…. This kid is in my class. 15 behavior write up since September 1st. Fights, threats, erratic behavior, running away from home. 

I’m genuinely scared. He shows violent tendencies and I worry for when he realizes the kids encouraging him are not doing it because they’re friends, but they laugh and get a rise out of him. 

I see everyone trying to be helpful from admin level, but he’s still in full classes with no para support but requires full and all attention for safety. We discussed during our PPT with the family that every teacher has to be with him all class period. They echoed the same thing at home. 

At the well-being of my self and others, idk what to do. Do I go to the union? I want to help this kid, but I genuinely am scared of him. I also want to do right by all my students. I want this kid to get help, not be outcasted and felt unwanted.

It had been a tough morning, one of my form had stolen my phone charger from the computer during mentor time and it had soured my entire day. My irritation was slipping into everything I was doing and my classes could feel it - and were responding in kind. 

I really didn't want to go on duty, patrolling the AstroTurf means being both an impromptu referee and crowd control while still attempting to stop the year 11's from sneaking round the back to smoke. It's not exactly relaxing, unlike the cushy indoor duty areas that always seem to go to a member of SLT. But out I went, trying my hardest not to overreact to the odd swearword and to be polite when talking to students. 

One of my form, lets call him Dave Davidson, starts arguing with me about why he can't wear his molded studs on the AstroTurf. Very quickly it becomes clear that he doesn't actually care about the boots, he's just an angry 15 year old that wants to argue with someone. So I sucked up my annoyance and gave him nothing to be angry at, all the while trying to get him to open up about what is actually bothering him. In the end he finally talks (argument with a teacher, scared that he's falling behind but doesn't want to admit that to anyone, normal stuff) and gets back to playing football. 

Lunch ends soon after, and as I go to chivy the boys back to class Dave turns to me and says ""Thanks for talking to me Dad"". There's about a 2 second silence before the jokes and the puns come thick and fast from the surrounding boys. Dave (bright red) starts stammering excuses about how he was ""thinking about my Dad and it just came out"". Not really thinking about it I calm them down and get them back to class. 

It's only when I'm setting up for my next lesson that I realize something. Dave doesn't have a Dad. His biological father left when he was very young and his Mum has raised him on her own since then. Maybe it was a slip of the tongue, maybe I'm reading to far into a silly interaction, but I'm going to choose to believe that I made a difference today.

1548991827.0,I Made a Special Education Aide Cry Today,"I'm a 58 year old chef instructor. I teach Culinary Arts at a Title I high school.  Since it can be challenging for my school to fill faculty positions since we serve students from impoverished backgrounds in a rural area, we've had to fill several of our faculty positions with long term subs.

One of our special education teachers is a long term sub. This teacher supervises a self-contained special needs class and is assisted by several full time instructional aides.

The teacher who was responsible for this class is still at our school ... but due to staffing shortages, building admin assigned her to another position. The program and procedures that she started is still in place. One of the programs that this class is responsible for is running our recycling program.

Every week, the students from this class push two wheeled recycling bins down the halls of our school. Classroom teachers leave flattened boxes and blue trash bags filled with cardboard and paper in the hallways for the students to collect. All of these items are collected and stored behind the school for the trash company to collect. Based upon the weight of whatever is collected, the school gets paid roughly $50 per ton. All of the money earned goes back into our building fund.

My Culinary Arts classes have benefited from this fund. Since roughly 1/3rd of my students can't afford to pay their $40 annual lab fees, the school has always covered the cost of these students. Without this funding, I'd either have to cut back our kitchen production to just two days a week or I'd have to shut the kitchen down in March after we expended our funds. As it is, the money made from recycling has helped to keep our kitchen open through the end of the school year.  It is partially for this reason that I'm very grateful to the special education class that oversees our recycling program.

Ever since this program started 3 years ago, I've noticed that the kids have a good work ethic. They always come by during 5th period to pick whatever we've left outside the Culinary Arts kitchen. They're never loud or fussy. If it wasn't for the trundling sound of the wheels in the hallway, I wouldn't even know that they were there.

Last month we had some extra ingredients from the production of ambrosia salad. The advanced students of my 6th period class produced the additional portions pictured below to the give to the special education class as a way of saying thank you for all of their hard work.

Since my Culinary II students have been working on the production of *cha-shu bao*, Chinese rolls (steamed or baked) stuffed with BBQ pork, I had 4 student groups produce a sweet roll dough. Although the dough was enough to make 12 rolls, we only needed 8. I therefore took 1/3rd of each group's product and used this dough to create these orange glazed cinnamon rolls for the students who run our recycling program.

&#x200B;

The cinnamon rolls were just coming out of the oven when the kids came by. Since I didn't know if this would be a convenient time for the students to have their cinnamon rolls, I asked one of the special ed aides to come into the kitchen. When I showed her these treats and told her that I had wanted the students to have them as my way of saying thank you for all of their hard work, the aide burst into tears.

""Nobody ever thanks us,"" she cried.

I reminded her that last month we gave her class fruit ambrosia.

""But you're the only one,"" she sniffed. ""No one else ever takes notice of our students.""

I stepped back because she looked as though she wanted to hug me. Since she knows that I'm autistic, she also knows that I don't like being touched. She took a moment to regain her composure and one of my students actually stepped forward to ask if she needed any help in getting the cinnamon rolls back to her class.

She smiled and nodded.

When she stepped into the hallway with a full sized sheet pan holding 18 cinnamon rolls, her students gasped.

""Are those for us?"" asked one of the kids.

""It is!"" smiled the aide.

Her students cheered. It was a touching moment. I especially respect the fact that instead of abandoning their recycling bins and racing down the hallway to return to their classroom, the kids carried on with their responsibilities. They didn't even chatter, though their huge smiles spoke volumes to my heart.

It was a good day. (Smile)

1638890557.0,Dealing with next door teachers,"Man I just need to get this off my chest. I'm a new teacher at this school and things have been mostly going great, however, I've had some issues with the teacher next to me.

She is a resource teacher with only 5 students max. I have 20 students crammed into a small space just big enough to manage the mandated covid restrictions. It's cramped.

In this school, admin allows students to sit in the hallway to work. I allow a few students spaced out to sit in the hall to work independently. It started with her coming to me saying that she ""knows my students are working but their presence is distracting her students"". If they so much as breathe wrong she's in my door telling me to bring them inside. If they dare talk or ask a question, she says it's like ""having a class right outside her door"". I literally try to pick only the best students to sit out in the hall. I have one class that makes it a necessity.

The she started coming to my door or calling me on the phone because my students were being too loud IN the room. My classes are VERU collaborative and we play Blooket quite often. I am not the kind of teacher that expects students to sit like perfect angels in silence after the past two years but I do make sure to facilitate classroom management to keep their excitement at an appropriate level. It seems like the appropriate level for her is complete silence. She has at least once shut my room door without asking. I am not supposed to shut my room door for reasons I won't get into here. Meanwhile she refuses to shut her door at all.

Then just yesterday she walks up to my room door with her FINGERS IN HER EARS to tell me my video was too loud when it was the same volume my videos always are.
My students sort of looked at me like lol what after she left.

Meanwhile when I'm doing prep or having lunch, she has her videos so loud that I can hear it in damn Canada. And she herself is so loud I can hear exactly what she's saying crystal clear.
I'm not sure what she wants me to do, it's frustrating because I feel like even if my students are being as quiet as possible for teenagers working in groups, she's still not satisfied.

It's really hard to draw tech boundaries.Now with the pandemic, we are communicating that extra amount online for work, with family and friends and even relaxing online looking at screens. I'm sure that nobody is a stranger anymore to understanding some of the impacts it can have on mind and body.

I found that taking a 24 hour break, once a month, from Friday evening until Saturday evening (yes, just like shabbat)  makes a big enough difference, yet doesn't  interfere with my professional life all too much. It definitely made me feel refreshed, energised and I always ended up doing things that felt more meaningful, like learning an instrument, reading books that I never got to reading, spending time with loved ones, or being in nature.

The other thing is that I noticed it effected other aspects of my relationship with habits to the screen in the long run, in that I stopped looking at my phone before going to bed, was more conscious of the phone and how it was impacting my daily life etc. Taking that break heightened my sensitivity to knowing the difference it makes. It really makes a difference.

I have six years of teaching experience and have felt so burnt out since the 2021-22 school year. I have taught in this predominantly white suburban school district since 2019.

I feel very isolated as the only black teacher at a particular school in this district. My intelligence, content expertise, and teaching strategies have been questioned numerous times throughout my time at this school. Prior to working at this school, I taught at a very diverse school with diverse staff members. Not once did I feel this way nor experience this. I only left my last school for a salary increase. The microaggressions that I'm facing were confirmed when last weekend I met up with one of my white colleagues - who is a wonderful teacher and person - who told me recently she'd once overheard a group of teachers gossiping about me. She is actually the person who conducts my annual evaluations and is the reason I have lasted at this school. She told me the other teachers have questioned how I run my classroom (for no legitimate reason at all) and the ""way I communicate things."" Although I speak very professionally and intelligently, there are times I use ebonics (African American vernacular English) without realizing it.

After my trusted colleague told me this, I am seriously considering leaving this district or possibly teaching altogether, although she reassured me that I am a terrific teacher based on my evaluations and shouldn't let their comments affect me. I am already super hard on myself, so when you have veteran teachers telling other staff members that you aren't good at your job, it feels defeating.

1543641219.0,A training paid off and I asked the toughest question ever,"We had a PD about suicide prevention maybe a month ago. I don't know how many people took it seriously; I'd be lying if I said I really took it seriously, but I paid attention to the central ideas.

The last thing they wanted us to do was practice asking each other ""Are you thinking about killing yourself?"" It was uncomfortable and we went through the motions and awkwardly chuckled about it. The training emphasised how important it was to ask if you see signs of a person considering suicide, using those words and not euphemisms, and to not be afraid to do so. Not a situation most teachers would expect to be in.

That is, until today. I got an email from a student that sent up a huge red flag, and when they came by later, I pulled them aside.  We talked, and I asked them if they were thinking of killing themselves. And they said, ""No, not lately,"" but that they'd had thoughts like that in the past.

This situation isn't over--the student needs help and I've notified everyone I can think of who can help them. But while my heart aches for this student, I'm ever so glad I at least paid attention in PD. ",teaching
1670789495.0,My worst day of teaching yet...,"I'm a first year science teacher teaching 8th grade, and I've honestly been having a horrible time all year. I really wanted to teach high school, but I was so mentally exhausted over the summer the only job available in my area when I went to apply was a middle school. Big mistake, I think.
 
For context, I have ASD, so I know I have some quirky behaviors, which is especially why I hate middle school because that's the age where, especially the women, start picking apart everything and really are just.... awful.

I've spent quite a bit of my weekend ruminating over a student telling me to, well, end myself and quit. I knew going into teaching I was going to run into a wide variety of issues with a wide variety of kids. But having every possible awful thing happen during my first 4 months of teaching is really taking it out of me, I won't lie. I had a student very blatantly and loudly make fun of my neurodivergent traits, which not only made several students uncomfortable, but now I have to face that student again and again, every day, unallowed to be angry or treat them any different, and I just don't know how I'm going to do that right now. I know kids say things out of anger or frustration, but I just can't handle getting purposely provoked and antagonized every day, you know?

The kid who told me to off myself got sent to juvenile detention for 45 days because they really have just been that awful to the entire team. The other kid though is getting 1 day of OSS, then I have to deal with them again. They have been absolutely awful to me and interrupt my class to laugh at me or yell awful things and whenever I ask them to stop they just blow up at me and it sends me into a panic. I've lost count of the isd passes I've written this kid. I try not to treat them any different but I don't feel like I deserve to be screamed at in my own classroom by a 14 year old.",teaching
1613757901.0,My school’s pipes burst,"I’m a first year teacher in TX. We’ve been out of school this week due to the snow storm, and just received email that we’re not allowed to go back onto school grounds because pipes have burst in multiple of the schools and they’re flooding. 

I’m an Art teacher who last week thought that I’d get one day off of school - I have multiple sinks in my room and I still left projects on drying racks, in open shelves - even the ones that were put away were just put in filing cabinets. I just can’t fathom what to do. I’ve been dealing with Covid all year long and I just cannot grasp the fact that it’s a random winter storm that’s destroying my kid’s work.

From insurance to talking to my students to making a brand new project out of the scraps, I’ve been able to talk it all out. Texas is strong and so am I.

We have a new principal this year and my formal observation last week did not go very well. I was under the impression that these formal observations should not be a show. They want an accurate picture of what your classroom is like on a daily basis. So, I didn't plan anything special. It was just another day in the classroom. We were doing a first read of a non-fiction text about Dr. Jane Goodall's work with chimpanzees. The feedback I got was that the kids were not engaged. My state has a 4 point observation scale, so I got a few 2's. I didn't really care too much about this. It's fine. The teacher next door to me, a 6th grade science teacher, put on a show. She totally pulled a new topic and had a demonstration and lab for the students. She got all 4's on her observation with feedback like ""your kids were excited and participating in the lesson!"" Well, no shit. It's nothing against this teacher, she and I are cool. She's a nice person and I consider her a work friend. But I am so frustrated. It wasn't even the principal who did her observation. Science and social studies departments have the assistant principal as their observer. He is a chill guy that is the ""good cop"" when kids get in trouble. The principal is tougher. He is the ""bad cop"". I am crushed. In am environment where it seems like admin and school districts are firing teachers over nothing, I am terrified that I am not going to get a contract renewal for next year.

1650924227.0,How do you respond when girls get upset about the sexism behind dress code?,"As the weather warms up, we are being asked to reinforce dress code. It’s pretty standard: nothing super low cut, nothing transparent, no bare midriffs, tank tops with thin straps, “suggestive clothing”, finger length shorts and skirts, unsafe footwear, clothing with profanity or slurs, hats, hoods, etc.

We are in a fairly upper middle class, predominantly white district (if it’s relevant). Every time we reinforce the dress code, girls complain. And I, being a fairly young woman, am someone they try to appeal to because they think I’ll “get it.” And I do, to a degree. I think it could use some major revision, but I don’t have that power. I’m just being told to reinforce it.

1606969211.0,Discipline system at my school is making me feel gross,"I'm currently in my second year of teaching. When I took this position, I had no idea that corporal punishment was still a thing that was allowed in schools, but I quickly learned that a lot of school districts still use it in their disciplinary model. Last year, it seemed like they were used pretty sparingly, but this year they are using ""swats"" a lot and they are being combined with other types of punishment. I will hear administrators use language like ""I lit them up"" when referring to giving swats (insinuating that they hit certain kids harder) and it's super tacky. I sent a student to the office for bullying another student, and they apparently gave him 3 swats, and then after school he had to run bleachers because he's an athlete. I mean, he needed to be punished for the bullying in some way (this was an ongoing thing) but now I feel like our relationship is ruined because he associates me with this excessive punishment. They always give them the option of ISS over being swatted, but they seem to really try to coerce the students into taking the corporal punishment (you'll miss sooooooo much school & won't be able to play sports, etc.)

I really am not looking for advice because I'm planning on leaving this position at the end of the year, just wanted to rant about how ridiculously antiquated and bizarre this whole thing seems.

EDIT: I feel SO much more validated in my decision to leave this district since reading all these comments. No joke, I really have felt like I'm somehow in the wrong for being so opposed to my schools use of corporal punishment because as far as I know, the entire staff and admin seem to really believe in it as a behavior deterrent. I mentioned this in a comment, but they *genuinely* believe that kids in other districts must be running around like wild animals because they aren't being physically punished for wrongdoing.

For clarification about my bully incident, I had discussed this issue with this students parent and with an AP and it was established that he would spend time in ISS if the behavior continued, which is why I sent him to the office, BUT they gave him the ISS or swats ultimatum.",teaching

I’m also done with the idea that teachers have to be perfect in every way in order to be considered a good teacher, or even a teacher who is fit to teach.

1617129151.0,The satisfaction of saying “no.”,"Am currently on medical leave (so no access to anything school related except the texting app I use to communicate with students). A student athlete (high school) who during the school year consistently texted me after 11pm about turning things in late so they could be eligible for grade check the following morning (and not in a polite way—they would escalate to all-caps texts if I didn’t answer them at midnight) texted me Sunday night saying, “You know how we (i.e. this kid) sometimes (always) turn in work right before the term ends? Well I don’t know the sub’s number or email so who do I contact to turn all my late assignments in tonight?” 

In my school we’re not allowed to reject late work—if it’s from that grading period we have to accept it up to our deadline and many teachers even accept work after and end up doing grade change forms. This is encouraged to the point it’s expected. We’re also not allowed to fail above a certain percentage—if you do, you’ll end up on a growth plan. This of course results in all the students thinking of deadlines as negotiable, test scores being lower because so many kids ignore work until the deadline then attempt to do a term’s worth in one night, thereby retaining nothing, and I fear for how they’ll fare in the real world. 

So it was very satisfying to reply that I told them before I went on leave that the sub doesn’t get paid to grade after hours, and that they would have to respect  whatever deadline the sub gave them. In short, “no.”",teaching
1610979405.0,My favorite two points a parent made in an email to me and my humble responses.,"1.) “You need to reconsider the grades you’re giving these kids...” (edited for punctuation and spelling)

Hmmm...last I knew, I wasn’t giving grades out willy nilly but seeing if students were able to answer questions correctly when asked. If a student leaves that question blank, meaning there is nothing written for it, even the most lax of graders would count off. Also, if I was just giving out grades, they’d be on some weird scale no one else understands (Maebe’s crocodile in spelling would seem normal).

2.) “I know all these kids don’t deserve zeros.” 

Take a moment to stifle your laughter. If we got into who “deserved” what, it would be a bloodbath, especially since the particular class I have this year cheats as naturally as breathing. I’ve watched students pass around one person’s completed work and then everyone turns it in. Those assignments go straight to the trash because I’m not taking my time grading it if they didn’t take time to do it.

I’m pretty lenient when it comes to grading assignments other than major grades. For homework, I call it Completion+. Since homework is practice, I don’t want to hit a student who is still learning, so if I can tell they made a real effort to answer correctly, they get the points. If it’s one word that has no connection to the topic, is skipped, or is the definition off Google with zero thought to how it would tie into the class (for example, if they were asked to define “bow” and we were learning about the Battle of Agincourt, if they define it as a piece of ribbon tied to the end of a child’s pigtail, it would be wrong) no credit is awarded.

**Who are you?**

I am a physics teacher in the Chicago Public Schools. For the last 7  years I've been teaching 9th grade physics but in the fall I will be switching to upper classmen. I have also have a minor biology and have taught it a little bit way back when.

**Why now?**

I've played around with the idea of making a start up but with so many kids needing to learn science outside of the lab this year I knew now was the time. 

I've spent the last few days figuring out how to host a website, buy a domain (What exactly is DNS? Did I configure it correctly?) and cleaning up the apps enough that another human who isn't me could reasonably figure out what to do with them. 

**What've you got for me?**

The apps are sorted by content area and how you might use them. I want to help as many students as possible get a high-quality three-dimensional science education. The apps will always be free.
### Virtual Labs/Phenomena
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Bug In Meadow](https://whscience.org/buginmeadow/) - **Biology** - Replicates the common Bead Bug activity. click/tap the bugs on a meadow to eat half of them. Click ""count"" to see how many of each color survived and then have them reproduce. After several generations you see strong selection pressure based on the colors in th meadow. This is one of the first I made so it looks janky but it works better than any actual beads and cloth version I've seen. 

[Mg HCl](https://whscience.org/mghcl/) - **Chemistry** - Simulates HCl reacting with Mg. Shows the molecules and graphs. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers.

[Rusting](https://whscience.org/rusting/) - **Chemistry** - Simulates rusting at different temperatures and environments and for different shapes. Shows the molecules. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers. 

[Temperature Solids](https://whscience.org/temperaturesolids) - **Chemistry** - Simulates the movement of particles in two solids at different temperatures. You can change the size of each solid (number of particles) and starting temperature and you can drag them to touch or not touch. You see a graph of their temperature over time. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers. 

[Cart and Pulley](https://whscience.org/cartpulley) - **Physics** - Cart attached to a string over a pulley with a weight on the end. It has basic directions on the screen. Also available  [without directions](https://whscience.org/cartpulleynodirections).

[Collisions](https://whscience.org/collisions/) - **Physics** - Change masses and initial velocities and measure final velocities.

[Electric Car](https://whscience.org/electriccar/) - **Physics** - Is this useful to anyone? I don't know but I might as well put it here - You set the maximum speed of an electric car and watch the battery drain. I used it for my students to practice looking at linear and non linear relationships. It was part of a whole unit on electric cars. 

[Index of Refraction](https://whscience.org/ior/) - **Physics** - How can you tell the difference between a real diamond and a fake? Use Snell's law of course. Practice on water, glass, and plastic then determine if your diamond sample is real or a fake. In this simulation you drag and rotate a laser, ruler, and protractor. 

[Roller Coaster Motion](https://whscience.org/rollercoastermotion/) - **Physics** - Change the angle of the slope and initial of a roller coaster. Record and download position, velocities, and acceleration.


### Measurement or Problems
Think of these as virtual practice problems. Students make measurements and calculate or figure something out. 

[Gel and Restriction Enzymes](https://whscience.org/gelre/) - **Biology** - An old request of my wife's - Two simulations. The first is using restriction enzymes without sticky ends. The second is moving DNA segments a la gel electrophoresis. Keeps track of how many you have done. 

[Ants](https://whscience.org/ants) - **Physics** - Two ants run across the screen. Students use a ruler and stopwatch (included digitally) to find velocity and acceleration. It's like a physics problem but with a real moving object so all the quantities have meaning. There are many calculations that can be done of varying difficulty.

[Motion Yes No](https://whscience.org/motionyn) - **Physics** - One of the hardest things for phsyics students is keeping a clear distinction between velocity and acceleration. This app helps by putting a moving object in front of them and asking, 'is there velocity?"", ""is there acceleration?"", ""is the velocity changing?"", etc. This is very frustrating for the students, but I find it to be very helpful. I have many versions of this asking about different quantities and including the direction. There is even a test version if people find it helpful. Keeps track of number in a row.

### Diagram Makers
Sometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.

[Blood Pressure Diagram](https://whscience.org/bpdiagram/) - **Biology** - A request of my wife's - Shows the dial on an analog sphygmomanometer. Can show systolic and diastolic side by side or on the same dial. Use a screenshot to save the image. (Win-PrtScn or Fn-Win-Space on Windows, Shift-Cmd-4 on Mac)

[Pedigree Maker](https://whscience.org/pedigree/) - **Biology** - A request of my wife's - Make pedigree diagrams by dragging the pieces around. Double click to select a piece. Use a screenshot to save the image. (Win-PrtScn or Fn-Win-Space on Windows, Shift-Cmd-4 on Mac)

[Energy Bars](https://whscience.org/energybars/) - **Physics** - Tiny app to make bar graphs of types of energy. Drag up and down in each bar. Double Tap the label at the top of a bar to remove it from the diagram. By default it shows kinetic (KE), potential (PE), chemical (CE), heat (HE), and total energy (TE). Hit save and it will download the image.

**What's next?**

I don't know. I have a lot more that I haven't cleaned up yet. If people are using them then I could work on them. I will probably be making a lot of new apps too since CPS is starting all remote in September. Updates will be posted at [whscience.org](https://whscience.org)",teaching

I don’t think he would actually do it. And I told him that you can’t get guns here in Canada (kind of a white lie) but that this sort of thing doesn’t really happen here. I know it does but I wanted him to get his mind off of it and didn’t know what else to say. He tends to ask questions off topic to get out of doing his work. I asked him questions like « why do you want to hurt people? » and he said he doesn’t, it was just a joke.

I don’t know if I would be overreacting to talk to a school guidance counselor about this. He is not usually aggressive or anti-social. He seems to trust me more than most of his teachers because I am a young male (like him) and not very strict. But I don’t think I should let this go.

The students knew that the threat had been from a Snapchat account that said they would be shooting up the school 5th period. Every period wanted to talk about it for at least a few minutes, and there were kids that were legitimately frightened. During third period, a new post from that account was made that spread like wildfire. It said, “two periods left. I’m in the building”. And after that, I could no longer teach. Kids were scared, others were talking big about taking on the shooter. They were clearly upset, even traumatized by the threats, violence, and other events in this community.

1604348045.0,Demoralized and sad after students’ first quarter reflections (online),"I’m a high school English teacher doing fully online right now. I asked my advanced senior English class to reflect on how online learning has been going for them this quarter. And of course, just like online teaching sucks, so does online learning. 
Some of the answers I’m getting is that it’s hard to focus on the computer during synchronous classes, that they don’t feel comfortable unmuting and talking, that they don’t feel motivated to do their work, that they’re overwhelmed by all the tasks they have to do for all their classes. They are not singling out my class with these comments, and they are lovely young people who do their work, but in my fragile overworked state, reading these is making me tear up.

I’m already thinking up some more community building activities we can do, assigning them tasks/roles so that they are more active during class, doing more with breakout groups (we are on Teams, where group meetings are a pain to manage). But I’m just so sad at this reminder that even though this is probably the year I’m working the longest hours on my teaching, it’s also going to be the school year where I have the lowest rewards. Sigh.

Anyone else feeling this right now? The school year  feels like an interminable slog right now.",teaching

I lived through all of this too. My life has been chaos for the past 5 years, plus a hard divorce,   and a move to the county north of Sonoma, where the poverty level is much higher.

We still have all-site staff meetings once or twice a week, and they are asking to pick standards we can promise our students will be able to reach by the end of the year... we narrowed our math ones down from 10 to 5. We only picked 4 ELA ones out of about 40? I’d say my grade level would usually promise to get to about 30 or so standards at least taught and 20-25 taught to mastery. It is killing me to know just how little these kids are learning. And most of my students don’t turn in their work!! I have 24, during a zoom class where we spend about 20 min of “work time” together 10 ish finish and turn in the work. Maybe 3 or 4 more will finish and turn it in during the afternoon.

1598115204.0,Do people even value education anymore?,"I want to start off by saying that I am frustrated by social media and the government. People expect teachers so lay down and risk their lives in the classroom, but for what? Because our admin told us so? The president told us so? We’re all being threatened to do as we’re told, or we will lose funding? Do we even get paid enough to risk our lives with COVID-19? Will the potential hospital bills, under any insurance plan, be feasible for teachers to pay back if they do get sick? 

Background:

I have a masters degree in educational tech.

I make roughly 41,000 a year in MO.

I lose approx. 13,800 to taxes every single year.

That means I take home about 27,200 as my yearly salary.

I am a single person.

I had a dog that recently passed, but he was my only dependent.

I live with a roommate in a rental apartment. I have to due to my income, yet MO is considered one of the cheapest states to live.

I have a second job dog sitting to supplement costs.

I donated plasma for over a year until my body could no longer handle it, simply to offset living costs.

I am drowning in student loan debt.

My story is not unique. Many people have the same issues and concerns surrounding their job as an educator. Many people cannot live on their single income without sacrificing their time and quality of life. And if you have kids? Your income goes to child care. If you have a spouse? Maybe you can stay afloat, but it’s still not easy. Educators should not have to be married to receive a household income above the poverty line, at any age or any level of experience. Educators should not be afraid to have children or get sick for fear that it would bankrupt them. Educators should not have to have roommates into their late 20s and 30s to survive comfortably.

Is education even competitive anymore? Is that the problem. People just don’t see it as a valuable necessity? Is it a career sought after by professionals to work for the good of ALL students? I think about this a lot because doctors and lawyers make triple our income, yet we’re supposed to be the foundation of knowledge and skill in this country. We’re supposed to be heroes and leaders, giving up much of our first amendment right and voice on social media to ensure we are strong faces of the community. Education has become the most greed stricken career, which is a harsh reality I wasn’t ready to face. With admin/school boards choosing worse resources over better ones due to price. With teachers spending money out of their already VERY shallow pockets to provide for our students. With red tape and federal funding cuts that debilitate classrooms all over the nation.

The MO governor cut 133 million in k-12 ed funding this year alone, DURING the pandemic. And now we have an expansion of Medicaid bill that is also taking funding from education. It’s a great bill, I’m all for expanding healthcare, but can’t they take the funds from another location? I have no intention of leaving teaching for the next 3 years, but damn, does it make me sad.",teaching

1588509659.0,Did anyone leave (or are thinking of leaving) teaching because they don’t enjoy the act of teaching itself?,"Last Summer, after four years of teaching, I quit. I quit for all the usual reasons given, but also because I didn’t particularly enjoy the act of teaching itself.

Based on feedback, I was pretty good at teaching, and if I put the effort in I think I could’ve climbed the career ladder quite quickly. But my oh my I came to resent it. Though I’m perfectly aware of the need to behave professionally at work, as a teacher I felt I was putting on an exhausting acting performance every day. This was particularly draining as an introvert - there was no escape from social interaction! No opportunity for a quiet 30 mins. I didn’t find the content I taught interesting or intellectually stimulating (I primarily taught kids between the ages of 9-11). Behaviour was often frustrating. I never understood the adulation of children - some kids are fantastic, some are nightmares and the majority are fine most of the time (just like adults). I would feel horrendously guilty going on courses and meeting teachers from other schools who were universally passionate about their careers, whilst I sat there, completely apathetic. I would spend the working day clock watching and the Sunday night dread was unbearable. 

Whenever I read posts from ex-teachers, everyone seems to make it very clear that they ‘LOVED the kids and LOVED teaching, it was everything else’ that drove them to quit - it has become almost a cliché at this point. 

So did anyone else out there leave (or are thinking of leaving) because they just don’t like the act of teaching itself?

The question I asked was the very last thing that happened before the interview ended, and I didn't put into consideration that it may have offended them. I really do appreciate most of you giving me the advice I needed to hear the next I apply to another prek program. I've been an artist my entire life, and I'm use to criticism, constructive or not. It really helps to improve, or to acknowledge that some people just wanna push your buttons. Nonetheless, even before I asked this question, this place showed a lot of red flags, and due to that, would not be interested if they offered the job to me. I may have experience but I'm still a work in progress and I appreciate all of your advice.

This ended around a half an hour ago on Zoom. I was with the principal and director of the prek program in a prek-12 public school district for their prek art teacher position. Both female, and both sharing the same room while facing away from each other so they can be present in their own cameras. 

I was doing great. I asked appropriate questions, and despite my experience I sold myself as best as I can. The interviewers however showed they had no interest in me in the worst ways I didn't think were possible until now. Here are a couple of examples:

-lack of awareness to the state's new mask mandate (I'm in NJ) and backing that up with ""Whatever would be made aware to us through our district, we would follow it"".

-The director didn't ask me any questions.

-Halfway into the interview, the director turned off her camera, and physically walk passed behind the principal to exit the room.

-the principal got very defensive on a simple question I asked: Outside of being a part of the school district, what makes your program different from a standard day care center? (A prek-12 district is uncommon in the school districts I aim to apply to. I only wanted them to make a comparison, not to be offended. Let me know in the comments if this was something I shouldn't have asked, and if prek-12 public schools are common).

-they were quiet about my community outreach experience in  different socioeconomic communities.

“A small fraction of students in the South and Midwest have returned to classrooms, and the coronavirus is already disrupting plans. In one Indiana school district, the superintendent sent out a note Saturday thanking students and parents for ‘a great first two days of school!’ He also said several staff members had tested positive — and the high school was swiftly closed.

‘I’ve been in the business over 40 years — I have never experienced anything like this,’ said Lee Childress, a superintendent in Mississippi whose district has seen three students test positive since last week. ‘It’s kind of like drinking out of a fire hose because it’s happening so fast.’

A cautionary tale from Israel: The government rushed students back into the classroom in May, confident that the country had moved past the pandemic. Outbreaks ultimately closed more than 240 schools and led to the quarantine of more than 22,520 teachers and students.”

1651010626.0,students wrote a graphic fanfiction about me and i'm incredibly uncomfortable,"for context, i am not officially a teacher yet. i've been student teaching for the last few months, and that puts me in a weird position where students think of me more as a guest/friend and not a teacher. so sometimes they tell me things that i guarantee they would not tell their actual teachers.

a student mentioned that there was an account online where students write and post fan fiction about the teachers at the school, including some about me. this instantly made me feel weird, but i acted as if i was simply interested in reading what they had written, hoping that i could get enough information about the account to find and report to admin.

today the student told me the name of the account and i found it online. the stories are...inappropriate to say the least. some are violent, others are sexually explicit. i don't know what i expected. needless to say, i took screenshots and reported it to the school and am waiting for a reply now.

my placement at the school has ended and i've been hired to tutor for the rest of the school year. i'm hoping to get a full time teaching position there next year, but now i'm just uncomfortable about being there at all. has anyone else had something like this happen?

edit: i'm unaware of whether students were writing it at school, but i do know that students have been reading it at school.  part of the reason i reported it to admin was so IT could investigate it. IT has previously found students doing dumb/inappropriate things using their school accounts and it's possible this is the case as well. i don't know if they'll find anything, but it's worth a shot.",teaching

They also told us that if we aren't in it for the kids and we don't plan on growing as teachers, they are willing to get rid of us. I am desperately trying to get out of this career after a year and a half. But ironically, I've never made as money as I have teaching. Our school is already short teachers this year. I can only see next year it being worst.

Since fall, thousands of people from around the world have called the Just Scream line and recorded themselves screaming. The line will be open until January 21, and I want to give teachers a chance to share how they're feeling in this strange year.

Here's how to share your teacher scream with the world:

1. Call 561-567-8431. Don't worry, there's no live human on the other end of the line!
2. Wait for the beep, then scream! Make sure to say you're a teacher so I can put your recording in a new collection of submissions from teachers.
3. Hang up when you're done.
4. Check back in 1-2 days to hear your recording [here](https://justscream.baby/listen).

Cut to today, and he's in the group that failed the first test with a 2/5 and has to attend week 2. I was shocked and the kid was obviously upset and mostly confused (as are my co teacher and I). After digging a bit deeper with the kid, it seems like to came down to making logical leaps that may have been a bit too big, but seriously? He has the structure perfect, his ideas are decent and his grammar is understandable but not perfect. How could this kid fail when his friend who slept the whole first week passed???

1680471668.0,"Working at a boarding school: what it’s like, how to get hired (if it sounds appealing)","I work at a boarding school in Massachusetts. New England has a whole ancient network of schools like this - a bunch of wealthy & college-like prep schools that kind of fly under the radar. They offer a unique working environment that I think more people might be interested in if they knew what it was like. It’s also probably not for most people. 

I didn’t see too much discussion of boarding schools on this website, and I thought I’d post in case someone does a search. These places are actively trying to become less elitist, so there’s really not any particular background that you need to get a job at one of these places. Some of my coworkers are alumni & have PhDs, others went to community college and had never heard of Exeter before they saw it on Indeed. 

If anyone is interested I can post a comment with my advice about how you get hired at one of these schools (there's a whole vocabulary & outlook we look for in apps). I can also give a list of the good ones, okay ones, and bad ones. 

**Pros:** 

* Free housing. They give you a place to live and pay for all your utilities. This is part of how they get people to run the dorms (also a con; see below). If something breaks, they fix it immediately since they have tradespeople on staff and don’t want to have their property damaged. I heat as much as I want, use as much water as I please, etc. 
* Much longer breaks than public school; school year is about 150 days. Summer is three months long, winter/spring break are 2 or 2.5 weeks, Thanksgiving is always the full week, and there’s lots of long weekends. This is partly due to the nature of a boarding school; they have to have long breaks to justify the travel kids have to do to get home. 
* No commute. I wake up and walk to work. I hate driving but also hate cities so this is really nice for me. 
* Ready to go community (also a con sometimes). I'm friends with some of my coworkers and they live right near me. It's a bit like college in that way. 
* Free food three meals a day. This is great financially but also just in terms of convenience. It's also super good & healthy food, basically like an above average college dining hall. 
*  The kids are super smart and interesting. They come from all over the world & have awesome qualifications. The international students especially are delights to work with. If a kid is consistently fucking up, they get expelled. The standards that are maintained mean that all I do in the classroom is teach, and I get to teach at a high level usually. Some of the kids are smarter than I am, honestly. 
* These schools have really huge financial aid budgets so you're working with promising kids from rough backgrounds. It makes the job more satisfying, you're not just teaching rich kids as outsiders often assume. My school is like 1/3rd scholarship students. 
*  I get to coach the sports that I love, and they’re played at a high level & given really good resources. The school has slots for athletic recruits, so the teams are pretty advanced at the varsity level and fun to coach (or spectate). A lot of professional athletes have gone through the school that I work at. 
* I usually only have one prep and my class sizes are small (this term my smallest is 11 kids). Because I work in the dorm and coach, like most faculty here, they reduce my teaching load. So, I teach, but it’s not all I do - therefore, it stays amusing rather than something that becomes a tedious chore (like it was at the public school I started my career at). 
* Really good benefits. Salary is lower than public schools but I still make 60k a year early career, and you don't need an advanced degree. The salary you make on paper at these places is lower than what you actually make if you pick up the various side gigs that are abundant at complicated institutions like this (e.g., interviewing for admissions, substituting, proctoring SAT, etc). And my cost of living is basically zero.  

**Cons:** 

* You have to be “on” at random times throughout the day. I don’t work basically from 1-4 p.m. right now, but I coach in the evenings and then one night a week (and three weekends a term) I have to supervise the dorm (not in bed til 11 pm). Dorm duty can be fun but the late hours suck. 
* For the first \~7 years of employment, your free housing is an apartment within a dormitory. So, if you work at one of these places, you have to be comfortable seeing kids at basically all times of day & sometimes at night if something has gone wrong. If you actually like the kids, this isn't usually a drag. They walk your dog for you, they babysit for you, they want to chat, they’re pretty mature and fun to be around. But there is a definite loss of privacy. After >7 years in the dorm they give you an actual freestanding house to live in, though, so it’s not forever. 
* If you don't like a coworker, you have to live right near them. 
* Some of the kids are annoying or strange, or their parents are demanding or toxic. And because I see the kids so much, it can be especially upsetting when they fail or have personal issues. The highs are pretty high working here but the lows are also lower; things feel much higher stakes than at the normal public school I taught at. You really worry about the kids' well-being sometimes, even if it's clear that they're better off here than back home with their parents. 
* Administrative bloat is enormous and annoying. Way too many meetings and stupid office politics type stuff. These places aren't necessarily run by geniuses.

I loved my students and they loved me, but in May I was offered a job at a private school in another city, and I took it. I was given a last day, June 16. But I didn’t realize that the second June 16 was over, I would be completely locked out of all access to anything connected to my email address. I can’t look up a student’s email address, I can’t even access the results of their AP exams so I’ll never know how they did. I can’t access their old standardized test scores so I can remember how we did. I can’t access my financial statements. I can’t see old emails or responses to online work. I backed up some of my work, but not all of it. I can only contact the few people whose numbers I have.

The thing is, even up until June 16 I was still getting emails from students who didn’t realize the year was over. Some students that I really loved and who loved me were still trying to figure out how to use google classroom, or had only just gotten internet access. So I KNOW that most of my students don’t realize I’m gone. There are some students I knew but who weren’t enrolled in my classes who I never said goodbye to. It breaks my heart to think that some of them probably have tried to email me since June 16th. Do they get an automated reply? Or do they think I’m ignoring them?

My principal tried to get me access to my email again but her request was denied this morning because she doesn’t have the authority to request that in such a big district. Cutting me out so coldly feels cruel. Students hadn’t even received their grades yet for the year. 

It is what it is, and I need to find a way to be at peace with it, but my heart is heavy and I just needed a place to vent to people who might understand. Covid-19 took away so many lives and did so many worse things than this, but right now I am heartbroken that she took away my goodbye.",teaching

We sent out a call telling parents to pick up supplies in the car line. It was so wonderful seeing the smiling faces of our kids and hearing them calling out our names, truly excited to see us. But there was one that absolutely broke my heart. She was one that I was always on her to make better choices, stop that, do this, etc. When her car pulled up to the school she immediately jumped out of her car and started running toward the school shouting, “I’m so happy to be here!” It was horrible having to watch mom grab her and make her get back into the car. Let me tell you, I didn’t not sleep well that night. Seeing that sweet, excited face just crumble because she could not go back into her school was just too much.

When I was in high school, I had a teacher who will just refer to as Ms. Smith. Ms. Smith was my science teacher, but I don't remember learning a whole lot of science. She sat at her desk the entire time, and sometimes wouldn't seem to notice students sneaking out of the door. Everyone was cheating off everyone (including me who had never cheated before in her life), but it was mostly because no one knew what was going on. I remembered one day I asked a question about the work, and she snapped something like, ""I can't believe you don't get this,"" so I never asked her anything again. I used to dread going to that class because it was utter chaos. When I think about the type of class I DON'T WANT, that's the one I think of. Looking back on it, adult me suspects she may have been drinking as her behavior seem to mirror someone who was hung over or just depressed. Who knows what was going on in her personal life?
Ms. Smith had a son in my grade, and he was this very handsome athlete that almost every girl had a crush on. I barely spoke to him because I was a total nerd, so I didn't really know him.  After his senior year, he passed away that summer at a party probably doing dumb things that kids do. It makes me really sad to think how awful that must have been for Ms. Smith to go through the worst thing a parent could go through. My heart really goes out to that woman because no one should have to bury their children. 

So, I went back to my hometown last summer and talked to someone 6 years my junior who had also Ms. Smith. Apparently, she changed. This person told me about all the stuff they did in class and how she was very attentive and it was almost like we were talking about a different teacher---and I guess that's because we were. She had changed. 
This is going to my 8th year and some years have been better than others, and I'm not the same teacher or person I was 5 years ago. I know I'm not the best teacher in the world as I have made MANY mistakes. 

But, the best part about teaching is----Every year is a new opportunity. We are not chained to former versions of ourselves, especially if they are not our best version. Every year we have the opportunity to be someone's ""best teacher"" and make a positive impact on a child's life. 

Ms. Smith is still teaching and thriving today.",teaching
1607063114.0,"“Dude chill out,” “that’s rad” and other things I say to 12 years olds","Hi. This long, but I think all the back story matters.

I am a 30yo teacher in my first year teaching 7/8th grade science. Prior to this I got a BS in geology just out of HS and then spent my 20s traveling, working seasonal jobs, and rock climbing. I’m finishing up my masters in ED this semester and technically this first year teaching is also my students teaching year. Sometimes an Appalachia twang will come out in my voice (I’m from WV and teaching in AK), my sentences oft start with filler words like “so”, and I call students of both sexes brah, bro, and dude frequently when I’m both praising them or telling them to get back on task.

I love my job. I’m working harder than I have ever worked in my life (and I was a dog mushier for a couple years) but the relationships I’m building with these kids are awesome sauce and watching them learn is soooo cool. Side note: Today my class full of mask wearing 11 years old were able to independently come to the conclusion that people who say they can’t breath wearing masks are lying because O2 molecules are so small they can travel through the phospholipid bilayer. Be still my nerdy teacher heart!!!!

Anyway, I’m a pretty chill teacher. I really took to heart that the best discipline plan is having interesting lessons. And thankfully I have yet to encounter any major behavior issues in my classes (I know it will come someday). 

I mention my backstory, my job history (or lack of it), my language choices, and my being a total noob to the profession because I am worried that due to this combination of factors I am failing my students in some regard by being too easy-going.

DL; DR starts here 

I let my students get away with being pretty disrespectful. Specifics include making fun of the way I say words, mocking my 90s climber lingo generally, and yelling “fail” when I drop stuff. I let them get away with it because, 1. challenging them about it leads to conflict that erodes my ability to engage them in learning, and 2. I just don’t care. If I was capable of being embarrassed by children I wouldn’t be in this job.

So here is the big ask:
I’m I being too chill? Should I try to quell my linguist idiosyncrasies to set a more formal example for the classroom? Is allowing them to get away with being disrespectful in my class preparing them to fail in other classes?",teaching

We're told over and over ""These are unprecedented times!"" And yet we are held to the standards as though these are normal times.

This year, Admin is having us list every accommodation an ESE, 504, and ELL student is supposed to get on each day of our lesson plan. No exaggeration, my lesson plans for the week are 12 pages long. We have to list specifically how we differentiate instruction on our plan and basically have to show how we teach 3 lesson simultaneously. Admin also likes having 2 weeks worth of plans ahead of time.

I've been at the school for 4 years...every year we are having to add more and more. At this point, I am not lesson planning...I'm bookkeeping.

1668871319.0,Teaching ethics...or not.,"I teach in a conservative area and am in a constant state of worry that what I am teaching is too ""political.""   


The Army National Guard was invited to our school and students were sent to check out the equipment and listen to recruiter-type pitches. When we got back to the classroom, I felt compelled to fill in many of the blanks recruiters left out. For instance: the potential for 18-month deployments to conflict areas where one could be put in harms way and required to take another life, differences between rights as a civilian and life under the Universal Code of Military Justice, payscale differences between officers and enlisted, and, naturally, what constitutes a ""just"" war/conflict.   


I also inform them of, and encourage them to think about, which subset of the population (in terms of socioeconomic status), recruiters spend the majority of their time focusing on, and who ultimately pays the greatest toll in conflicts our nation becomes involved in. I also delve into Dwight D. Eisenhower's presidential farewell address and his warnings about the military-industrial complex.  
Unfortunately, my class is quiet and it is difficult to get them to discuss a subject (any subject) which leaves me feeling like I am just preaching rather than trying to hold an informed discussion that values and considers alternative viewpoints. 

Is it wrong to point out issues within our country that are blatantly unethical? Is being ethical, valuing life(human or other), and pointing out where greed creates conflict and intense suffering a ""political"" thing?  Needless to say, given the patriotism (if not nationalism) found in many rural, conservative areas, I fear for my job. But I want students to make informed choices.",teaching

Ever since the call was made, he never came back. So the box is currently sitting in the meeting room :/ I bought a large bag of mandarins as a little something to show everyone I cared for our efforts, and every single person devoured that bag. Thanks to me we have a small breakfast at the end of the week before the kids come in. 

I'm an art teacher (27F) at a summer camp. I've been teaching at this camp for 2 years. But my boss has known me for 4. During the 2021-2022 school year I started my first year as an elementary Art teacher in an urban suburban area an hour  north from the camp. There were kids with behavioral issues, but for the most part, I encouraged a lot of art therapy for my students, which helped them flourish in class, while learning to respect my boundaries. Overall, it was a pleasurable first year with some moments I wish I did better. 
Back to camp, we've had this 6 year old boy since the beginning, and at least 2 to 3 reports a week are written up because of his behavior. Today the director, assistant director, instructors (including myself), and counselors had a meeting to help him succeed in camp. He's a kinesthetic physical learner, he likes humor, likes to experiment, and he likes being promised rewards when completing projects/participating. We put it to practice later after camp, and switched some counselors around to use as motivation to participate, and the results?  
Bomb and gun threats to counselors, raging and screaming, swearing, talking about his toxic home life to one of the instructors, almost breaking a counselor's finger, and tackling another one, because he didn't want to participate in a session. He had a total of 9 reports written up today. All while this was happening, my boss's boss called social services due to the toxic home life we've been told and advised by him and one of his family members. It's likely he's not coming back tomorrow. 
It sucks. It really sucks. I feel really bad for him. There's so much we could have done to make him feel welcome and safe. But we did all we could. We're a summer camp, not a public school.

They are getting too old for the educational kiddie stuff and now I have to contend with puberty-focused shows that are too old for my children, or just let them watch mindless videos of animals doing silly things.  Which are kinda funny and entertaining, but there is a void for things on their mental level (grade school).  

I tried to get my children to actively participate in solving this problem. I told them they might be famous YouTubers one day if they did it, so they agreed. For me it was just good for them to being doing something of variety during quarantine.   

We used their pet parakeet budgies to make videos that combined the ""cute animals"" concept with ""educational"".  The birds are Professor and Student, and they go through trying to teach different things. 

So far as the pilot, we've only touched on basic math. It takes a lot of work to make these videos and to keep the kids engaged. I have them doing all the voices and even doing the recording of the scenes.

But, they're losing momentum. In the beginning they were excited because we sent it off to a bunch of teachers in the local school systems, but apparently that is ""spam"".  So I am turning to our community here.

FIRST off -- I'm sharing so that teachers can perhaps use this as entertaining brain breaks for the students. I've seen what my kids get assigned during virtual learning. I've also seen what they watch at home. The idea is to just give them something educational and entertaining at the same time.

SECOND -- I want our community to subscribe to the channel so I can motivate the kids to do more videos. Once the subscriber numbers start climbing, I'll pitch to them how their fans want more good content and it is their responsibility to produce quality videos to help other kids.

So I hope this helps others, but of course I hope it helps us too. It is self-promotion, but I am under no delusions that the kids are going to become internet sensations by recording videos of their birds.

I want them to stay as far away from the snapchat, instagram, tiktok ""selfies"" -- producing a good quality video without shamelessly promoting oneself.

1697558339.0,Am I lazy or depressed or anxious or do I just dislike my job?,"I want to start by saying...I do plan on meeting a psychiatrist soon. But I still want to talk about this. To someone.

I can't figure out if I am lazy or depressed or anxious or if I just dislike my job. It's true that the past 3 years have been especially rough - losing my brother, losing my sweet old dog, a terrible breakup, getting COVID twice, getting stuck in my hometown due to financial constraints etc. I know I am very sad. But lately, my brain has been feeling extra chaotic.

I've always been a procrastinator - but I always got away with it. Always got good grades etc. Even got a raise at my current job (a job I don't  like but it pays the bills). But now it's just becoming too much. I'm slacking off at work - I want to do the work but I am frozen. I just spend the entire time freaking out about the pending tasks but not actually doing them. Then I work secretly on the weekends to make up for all the delayed work. They are starting to notice. They probably regret the raise now lol. If there are deadlines I can do the work fast, while panicking and feeling ill the entire time. It also takes me time to process information or instructions. I end up working the entire day but still don't get stuff done. 

Even in my personal life, things are bad. I cannot really focus on things. Get distracted easily if I try to read (and I used to love reading). If someone's talking to me I zone out pretty fast. It's like there's a million thoughts racing in my head. It has always been like this (based on my diary entries) but it has never been this bad. I feel like I cannot function properly. I don't feel like doing anything - be it brush my teeth or take a shower. I also know I am a bit lazy intrinsically, but i don't know if what's happening is all laziness or it's a mix of stuff. 

I also feel like I'll always find a way to be anxious. To use it as an excuse maybe? There are many things I want to do but I do none of them and blame it on my mental health while doomscrolling and wasting time. Again this is just me and my thoughts. But how can I trust my own judgement? Maybe I am lazy but I'm trying to convince myself that it's more than that so that I don't feel stupid. 

There are hobbies I want to pursue but I just don't do anything. The hobbies I had are gone too. I'm just a hunk of meat working as a corporate slave and doing a bad job while at it. If I win the lottery will I feel more free? I'll probably find another reason to be sad. Something like ""Oh now you have all this money and still you're not doing anything good for society. You truly are lazy."" I want to do good. But I feel frozen. I want to feel normal but I don't put in the effort to get better.

I'm just so exhausted. It's so noisy in my head. The only way I can keep the noise down is by sleeping or scrolling through my phone or eating a lot. Even then, I feel the anxiety. And still I do nothing.",mentalhealth

I'm not sure if this is related or not, but I have BPD, so I'm just more sensitive to certain things and life changes. It makes me sad that I can't see my friends as often as I used to because I've moved away from my hometown and everyone is busy with their own lives, jobs, and relationships. It sucks when people cancel plans more often or are even too busy for a phone call too.

Sometimes I get jealous that my boyfriend has friends who he can talk to and see more often than I can with my friends. Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm just not as important to my friends or something. I had lunch with my family last weekend, and my boyfriend was able to play video games with his friends and have a good time while I was gone. But my boyfriend is going to visit his dad next weekend, and I feel guilty for feeling sad about it because I tried making plans with my friends while he's gone but no one is available. I even went to a concert by myself for the first time a few weeks ago because no one wanted to go with me. It's not that I have a problem with being alone, I'm just ALWAYS alone or doing things by myself and sometimes it takes a toll on me. Even seeing people going out with their close friends all the time on social media gets to me too. Why can't I have a best friend who I can always count on to talk to or hang out with? 

I'm curious if anyone else has gone through this in their 20's? How do you even make friends as an adult??

I ended up trying and developing bulimia for a short period of time and then went to binge eating disorder when covid hit. i was also in a 5 1/2 year long relationship that my ex tried cheating on me multiple times, and broke lots of boundaries, which made me have horrible trust issues.

1697563053.0,"I hate people who have large social circles, who are popular and so on...","Hating on people with large social  circles is something I've wrestled with, and it's important to understand where these feelings come from. It's not easy to justify, but I'll try to explain.

For me, the root of this dislike often lies in personal experiences and emotions. I've had moments where I felt excluded or struggled to connect with others, which can lead to resentment. It's like feeling left out in the cold. Additionally, personal insecurities play a significant role. If I'm not particularly skilled in social situations or lack self-confidence, seeing others thriving in their social circles can make me feel even more inadequate.

These feelings of exclusion and the perception of being left in the cold have left a deep mark on my psyche. It's hard to shake off the memories of those moments when I yearned to be a part of something, but felt on the outside. 

Personal insecurities only add to the complexity of these emotions. My struggles in social situations, coupled with a lack of self-confidence, often amplify my feelings of inadequacy. Witnessing others thrive in their social circles can serve as a painful reminder of these insecurities.

Yet, acknowledging the irrationality of these emotions has prompted a shift in perspective.",mentalhealth

 I do it with the intention of venting and listening to advice, I am from Venezuela and currently my country has been experiencing a very complicated economic situation for more than 10 years. I feel that in some way this situation is already completely consuming me. I have had many desires to transform my life and escape the difficult situation I face in my country, but I feel that it is increasingly impossible. In the past I had hoped that Venezuela would improve, I had even participated in peaceful demonstrations for the freedom of my country, but the only thing I got was that the corruption of the Venezuelan government murdered my friend in one of the peaceful marches 4 years ago. 

My fervent desire is to live a better life, but opportunities in my country have been considerably reduced, economic inflation is very uncontrolled. To the point that the minimum wage in Venezuela is 5 dollars a month, I do miracles to survive every month. The lack of work and limitations in basic services has led me to have a perspective on my life and that perspective is that I feel like I have no future. Because of the stress I have been experiencing, I was diagnosed with ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" and I have only been able to calm my anxiety with exercises. But there come times when I can't stand this situation, Lately I have been feeling very depressed because of everything I am going through and that I have not been able to complete pending work because in my country the electricity often goes out for more than 4 hours. And because of that I have not received my payment to cover my personal expenses this month. I have tried every means to emigrate to another country but it is increasingly impossible for me, either because of the expenses that this entails or because I do not have family in other countries who can help me. 

I would like to receive some advice or words of encouragement that can help me, because I feel like I can't handle my situation anymore. Thank you for reading.",mentalhealth

Skipped the psychiatrist meeting last week, couldn't be bothered at the time, don't want SSRIs again (which I was told by therapist they would give me).

Therapist and psychiatrist are in touch. Today he went, ""take your pills, you have to, or you risk spending the rest of your life in a small dark cell, go to the psychiatrist, go to the psychiatrist, go to the psychiatrist"".

He said, this time, I'll probably get lithium, as well as SSRIs.

Huh. Didn't expect that. ""You're saying I'm bipolar?"", ""We don't like to use names for it""

So. I'm not a big fan of medication unless it's used for acute life-saving purposes. What can I expect if I decide to take the pills? I will probably not take the SSRIs because I'm not that depressed, I'm just emotional and confused about what to do with my relationship and by extension my life. That's why I requested talk therapy, CBT and couple therapy.

Now when we have been with each other the past two times it seems like he’s more interested in what’s going on on his phone. He of course has given me attention and keeps asking for mine. It’s like it’s normal but not. He’s told me over and over he’s not going anywhere which helps. 

My mental state has been terrible since Saturday and just really isn’t getting better. But my brain is seeing this as something that has happened with an ex and my brain won’t stop spinning with he’s going to leave me. How would I bring any of this up. I don’t want to say hey this is reminding me of my ex because I believe him when he says he’s not going anywhere and i don’t want it to seem like I’m trying to manipulate him or bother him with “are you gunna break up with me”.

I got tested 3-4 years ago, but the psychologist only diagnosed me with depression, as I was borderline ADHD (anyone who has been through that testing knows it neglects a lot of the symptoms experienced by females/inattentive ADHD sufferers, which I am both), and she felt it was more important to get the depression under control; my family doctor diagnosed my ADHD recently with a questionnaire and put me on Wellbutrin (tried Vyvanse and it aggravated my migraines), but she doesn't feel comfortable dealing with my son, as she's not a pediatrician. 
There is ONE pediatrician in my city, so he's obviously not taking new patients, as he's swamped since everyone else retired/moved; the local child/adolescent treatment center has refused THREE (3) referrals for my son, one psych in the bigger city has denied a referral, and I'm waiting on another doctor to get back to us; we have one psychologist and one psychiatrist (everyone else retired/moved), so I can't get help for myself from them; his school has done amazingly well with accommodating his needs, but have been super flakey on getting him tested - though the principal says it can be done, every time I've brought it up, I've been redirected and fobbed off.
It's not just that my son can't follow directions, he can't even do one task at a time. I spend every morning yelling, I've had daily stress headaches/migraines for weeks, but I can't just do everything for him, because I'm already squeezing my empty cup dry.

As a kid I noticed I couldn't digest milk really well, so I stopped eating cereal and drinking milk. But as there was no actual proof of a lactose intolerance my parents kept making meals including lactose and I never really wanted to be a bother when staying over at friends or family either.

Because of covid the government made it possible to check medical results yourself online in 2020. That was when I noticed at age 7-8, when I got informed I had a dust mite allergy, there were also some elevated values for milk, so I took it I was lactose intolerant, which my doctor never told me. I was kinda mad at him because I had never felt validated in the milk intolerance thing and just thought I was exaggerating or imagining things. I didn't get to tell him personally though because I had already switched doctors by then.

My mom still goes to him and in 2021 asked him if she could be lactose intolerant as well because she's been having issues with milk lately. He goes on straight denying I even have it, and tells her lactose intolerance is a made up thing by the modern world....

Fast forward to last week, when I underwent a colonoscopy to rule out Crohn's disease and everything was perfectly fine. Doctors think I may have some food allergies or intolerances and tell me only allergies will show up on blood tests or skin-prick tests. To be sure there's an intolerance I would have to skip certain foods for an extended period of time and see if it has a positive impact on my digestion.

Today I suddenly realize that the milk thing did show up on a blood test though. So I look some more into it, and as it turns out I'm not lactose intolerant, but have an actual food allergy...

Can someone please tell me why there's a 20 year old blood test that proves a food allergy and my doctor just didn't bother to tell me because it's a 'made up new world thing'???

Like many other people, I’m currently struggling a lot with loneliness.

 It goes all the way back to when I was 14 and I started isolating myself because of depression. Then COVID hit when I was 15 and ever since, I haven’t been the same person. I’m 19 now. 

It’s like I have forgotten how to make basic conversation. When I do, it’s fake, and people can tell. I can never enjoy social interaction, I don’t remember how to. All I do is ‘survive’ through an interaction. I say the things people want to hear, to make it go as smoothly and quickly as possible. To avoid saying something wrong; I treat conversations as if there is ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ answers to give instead of just experiencing it freely. It’s like I’m not present at all… 

And then something more complicated: I don’t know how to turn my acquaintances into friends. The last friends I’ve made were all pretty superficial connections. I’m usually okay with that but then it hurts so much when I see friends in the same friend group be way closer with each other than with me. I just don’t know how to get close to people anymore, and it’s killing me. 

It always feels to me like a friendship could end at any given moment. The concept of genuinely caring about someone outside of my family feels completely foreign to me. As well as having someone else care about me. That mutual support, loyalty, etc. I yearn for it so much but I have no idea how to get there. I feel stuck.

After those came i could have been save myself from this total life ruining depression but i continued medication as i probably generally needed it. Now i am in situation where i have worries and fears from those things which i experienced but probably they was just side effects and nothing worser. Any way now i fear/worry stopping it for 6 days and experiencing those side effects caused something permanent changes to me mentally and so on.

I mean person characteristic state feeling which every person can feel every moment but again i dont know if is this just created in my mind and there is no thing like that. My mun has retired from work and she said that sound strange to her mind that kind of general feeling could exist so i dont know could that be thinked as hopeful thought.

My mum says things will get better and little brother keeps this reason to think suicidal things stupid as he has experienced much worser things than me.

1697546488.0,Our neighbours stole from us and I am getting triggered,"Hello everyone, this is my first time making a post on reddit. I apologize if I am not able to explain the situation well enough.

So, I (21 F) am from India. me and my family, Grandma (63), Father (54), Mother (42), Brother (23) and Sister (8), moved into our new house beginning of August this year. This is our very first time being in a house we built in a property we own. it's not complete yet, there is supposed to be 4 floors but we moved in as soon as one of the floor was completed. 

This property is in the most posh area in our city and we are really fortunate to be able to live here, my father and mother have worked really hard with many jobs and businesses. We had been building our house for years, since 2011, little by little bc we couldn't afford to put much money in at a time. 

There are a lot of trees and wild plants in the property that we just started clearing and the day before yesterday, after clearing a big tree and we were able to look at part of our land clearer and my dad noticed that our neighbours' boundary wall was inside what is legally our land. they built this wall sometime between the years after the purchase of the land while we weren't living here. taking about 12-15 foot across and all the way down our property which is quiet a chunk.
Since we moved in they have started building something on that stole part of land to, what i assume, solidify this part under their possession. 

What can we do to get that piece of land back?
As the land here goes for very high rates I don't doubt that our neighbours would not be willing to give it back.

I asked my father what he plans to do about it and he said that what's done is done and what good would we get out of making things sour between us and the neighbours. Which really upset me.
my father hates confrontation and will avoid it even if it means severe financial and emotional damage.

Our family has been wronged by greedy people many times; we own a piece of land in a booming area for stores that makes it's market value very high and around 2010 the business owner who's property is adjacent to ours tried to get land grabbing gundas involved, forcing themselves in by breaking  locks and refuses to leave, public threatening where both my parents where beaten, my moms hair was pulled, my dad had machete put against his neck, etc. my dad was willing to give it up completely but because of mother's persistence and much illegal battle we finally got things under control. Another such property related situation was my dad putting his brother on the documents of the land they bought together out of respect and later his brother treating the property as only his and making us pay monthly rent for living in the house that was built on the land they equally contributed to. 

On a personal note, he literally didn't do anything when I was repeatedly raped by my step cousin, he didn't do anything when I was molested by our family friend who was close to my grandfather's age. It hurts to know for a fact that if someone were to do something terrible to you tomorrow your own father would not stand up for you. 

This situation of our neighbours stealing land from us and my father not doing anything about it has been, tbh, triggering. I hate injustice, I hate when shitty people do shitty things and get away with it, I hate when people don't stand up for what right. I just want my dad to stand up against such injustice.

Please share any advice or opinions on this matter.

I was ok at first, but it was really crowded in there and I could feel my chest tightening. Smelling cigarette smoke coming off the person I was sitting next to made it worse (I'm an ex smoker).

Part of jury selection involves the defense attorneys asking potential jury members questions. When it was my turn, I totally froze. I could barely choke out my words, tears were stinging my eyes, and I couldn't even concentrate on the questions they were asking, so I kept having to ask them to clarify, which made me spiral even more. I think they could see my visceral reaction and lucky for me, they let me go. 

Now I'm sitting here thinking and realizing that I haven't actually gotten better, it's just that I've removed myself from almost all social interaction with the exception of family and my neighbor. You can't get anxiety around people if you're never around people 🙃

1697544502.0,my friend won't shut up,"I have an online friend who lives in another country and he will not stop discussing the rapture. He is in his twenties, in university, and has decided Jesus is returning at any minute and won't shut up about it. 

It's becoming really difficult for me with my own issues. I have asked him numerous times to stop discussing it and he brings it up over and over . He is basically throwing away his education.

He refuses to do anything but complain and say that all the news means the end of the world is imminent.  

One of his mates described him as a ""paranoid fundamentalist autistic schizophrenic asshole"". Not really nice, but the truth is he often does act like an asshole. I suffer from mental illness and I think he does too, but he has no consideration for anyone. I blew up at him yesterday because he won't stop talking about it. He is obsessed. He has decided that his education is meaningless because Jesus is returning. I have strong beliefs in Christ but the rapture is total bullshit. He is driving me insane and refuses to see that he has gone down a rabbit hole . I pointed out there are rapture videos ten years old and people have believed this for centuries and still here we are and the world is still here and Jesus has not come back. I have no idea how to handle this anymore but to talk less to him. He is stressing me out and he is frightening me, he is like a maniac about it at this point.

1697532120.0,"I don't know how to move forward after this, they could have lied.","I've had lots of online sexual encounters in the past, particularly on NSFW reddit subs such as r/dirtyr4r and those places don't require actual age verification so for the majority of people I've met I've just taken it at face value for how old they were. And for the past few days I've been thinking of if I've done something illegal or not.

This sort of thing happens all the time and those sub reddits remain up but I still think of if I encountered several that may have possibly lied. I recall actually that I made a post looking for folks on r/dirtyr4r (a place that stated 18+ only) and they never said their age at first. I was 20 when most of these encounters occurred, the same time I became more promiscuous when I'd post nudes online and when I discovered I was bi. 

I thought they were 18 given the sub stated adults only and after we had some conversation and they sent a dick pic that I said was the best one I've ever received they said they were 16. Immediately I sort of freaked out and asked why they were here and what made them think it was OK. They said in the UK since aoc is 16 they thought it was fine. I'm from the UK too and while the aoc is 16, sending nudes is 18 and over.

I said this to them. The conversation was ceased and i reported them their account was banned. Even after this though I still thought just emphasising adults only in the descriptions of my posts was enough. Ultimately I was still taking people's word for truth though. I actually got banned myself for posting too much eventually (I figured since everyone seemed to keep reposting I'd do the same) and i haven't posted their since. I actually briefly contemplated going back to it recently but now that I've sort of had this fear I definitely do not.

I've made and sent very explicit content to some folks through text and imagery and I've received things obviously.

Even places like omegle with an 18+ section don't have any real verification and I've went there a few times in the past year (not showing myself on cam though).

1697549492.0,"ILLNESS DISCOVERY (potentially) , I FEEL FREE ❤️","Hi,

I (24M) have always felt neurodivergent or just typically not normal, this was always challenging growing up trying to find out why I was different; I mean this not as an offence but just my own observation but it seems neurodivergence is easier to accept if the persons appearance is also not considered normal or attractive. However growing up I remember from pretty young always being told I was handsome or good looking right up to now (as a child this was not meant inappropriately towards me, and do not recall any reports of SA below the age of 13) 

ANYWAY, fast forward to now. I have recently just ruined my life, one year ago I had 50k in the bank, a V8 Mercedes, fiance, baby on the way and big dreams and aspirations. This is all gone now. I still live with my ex, and baby until I start rehab in a few weeks.

 I developed a serious coke addiction late last year while making a lot of money selling uhhh adult street medicines, not long after my partner had fallen pregnant and also being diagnosed with depression and anxiety around the same time, which I started taking meds for. I believe what unfolded was a result of huge unrealised/unresolved child hood trauma, bullying, undiagnosed illness, mental health and not wanting to become my parents. Over the course of this time an entirely different version of myself surfaced, that would come out and piece by piece rip its/my own life apart right down to its core. 

Now, getting to the point finally. After doing some looking inwards over the last few weeks and a heavy amount of research I have come to the very synonymous conclusion that I was undiagnosed with autism as a kid which has now manifested as BPD, and potentially ADHD too. Not to be a hypochondriac, I need to have everything assessed and diagnosed.

This was incredibly freeing to feel, and relate to the things I was reading and finding. I hope it wasn’t confirmation bias and I was looking to attach to anything I could relate to. But I feel in my gut that my findings are right. I can finally stop ruining my life when I’m in relationships, I can be a good father, I can get treated FINALLY, I can be myself and I can control this dark horrible other side of myself that exhibits when i split, I can stop abusing drugs and alcohol and seek healthier coping mechanisms. I have never felt so motivated and happy to get my life on track before but I’m going to fix myself, because I was scared I was gonna remove myself from this world if I didn’t figure this out sooner or later. I can now have an explanation to all those I hurt when I was having an episode, and apologise to all of them. Thank you all for reading, please comment or DM me if you relate to this in some way and/or have any advice to offer ❤️

EDIT : For context, before my mental health deteriorated, I was very out going, big social circle, well liked/good reputation and I was very happy mostly. But I didn’t realise this was because I was riding the high of the relationship leading up to this and actually treated my partner like shit without realising that I might have BPD and I was afraid to have a low. Because in relationships, your SO is a massive trigger for BPD symptoms and this explains why my last 2 relationships failed and resulted in my ass getting dumped or cheated on.",mentalhealth

Some can call me lazy but honestly I wish I didn’t feel on edge when I do these things. Getting out of bed is a struggle. Moving out of the sofa is a struggle. I FEEL STUCK. I put off everything EVERYTHING.  

Since getting married I’m a pro procrastinator , I avoid things, I put things off, I find comfort in that I don’t have to do it NOW. I’ve been avoiding progressing financially, socially, academically. I finished my degree and since I’ve been stuck. Putting things off, avoiding thinking about what to do next. Is this fear? Or is this serious depression?  

I’m always anxious , always angry, always on edge. 

My childhood was TRAUMATIC. Mental and physical abuse everyday from my father. 

I left home and got married by myself. 

I want to be a better mum. Cooking makes me anxious. Going grocery shopping can make me have a mini panic attack because of my sons fussiness, financial aspects and just the stress of having to be organised. 

Adhd? Depression ? Sensory processing disorder?

I don’t have any debt, I have a good education, I have a well-paying job and I managed to save a good amount of money in the first few years of working. I also have a partner with the same life circumstances as me. 

I also know that a lot of my friends struggle financially and that I am privileged in that way, which is why I rarely if ever complain to them about my life, but always listen to them when they feel down and support them on their life journey every way I can. However, my friends seem to believe that because I am financially stable my life must be magical, and that I am somehow immune to depression, anxiety, and loneliness, which couldn’t be farther from the truth.

I became chronically sick a year ago and haven’t been able to return to work since then. I have access to health care and a partner that can support me if I lose my job, but it’s still unclear if I will ever be well enough to return to work. I feel incredibly lonely, because my illness prevents me from seeing my friends. I am anxious about my health and my future. I am too sick to do most of the things that gave me any sense of purpose or joy in life, except for reading. I also suffer from trauma surrounding my childhood and early adult years, which is influencing me even after 6 years of therapy. And I look around me, see the world burn in every way it can, and I am simply lost and hopeless. 

Yet, when I express my feelings, many of my friends react with a version of “be happy your life is so easy, just look how much it sucks for others”. I wish money would make me immune to mental and physical health problems, but unfortunately life doesn’t work that way. I feel like I am an asshole because I complain about being unhappy when others struggle to put a roof over their head… 😔 I don’t know what to think.

She doesn’t give me any strategies for combating my negative thoughts or anxieties. She just tells me to basically deal with it as it comes (like I’m not already trying) and when I tell her that it’s not that simple she again refuses that and says I’m just using excuses.

Like I know she’s doing what a therapist should when a patient is stuck in self pity and doubt. But the problem I have with this is that she doesn’t give me any alternatives, no strategies, nothing. Just endlessly ranting about how wrong I am in an attempt to shine any kind of confidence in me, but all that’s doing is making me feel like I can’t win or that it’s easier to give up.

 Also I do boxing, but have had very few fights, because I am also terrified of the ring and people yelling and judging. So I'm not sure here too, because I love the sport but unable to fight and everyday I feel like I want to and the next day I'm glad I didn't ask my trainer to find an opponent. 
I also have a gf and here too I feel so confused that one day I think she's the one and the next day I want to leave her. 

Basically in every part of my life I feel like I have no clue of what I'm doing. I always thought life would settle itself when growing up, but it doesn't.
 I came to the bitter acceptance that it's like this but I also feel that a life like this is not worth living, yet I'm not depressed. 
I'm constantly shifting mood and thoughts and I can laugh and cry and be mad and happy, often I'm so confused that I don't even recognize my own emotions and it' terrible because sometimes I can't even explain what I'm feeling.
Some days it even seems to me life is just a dream and that I'm going to wake up one day, or that we just live into a simulation.
I'd like to know if someone else feels the same way or if it's just me...

Btw I'm seeing a psychologist but not sure if she's helping me... If you ask me now I'd say no, if you asked me yesterday I'd say yes. She wanted to prescribe me some meds for mood shifts and I let you imagine what I thought of it... And what I thought the day after..

So that's it, it would help having some confrontation with someone who feels the same/someone who overcame the feeling.

1697555578.0,I need some help and advice please !!!,"So I'm posting on here as I assume it has something to with my mental health . I have been struggling with depression , extreme anxiety and stress for the past couple of years . It's only been last few months that I have been getting increasingly worse. Anyway.  , I have a stressful job , I am chef in a high end restaurant and I'm one of the youngest there (21f) and so the pressure is quite high .I have recently moved far away from my home town  . And just general life stresses such as money etc have come into play more recently. I havent been getting much sleep . 

Anyway it is my day off today and after doing some bits around the house I went to go for a lie down as I was feeling super tired. I started having the worst hallucinations . And then when I thought I had woken up I felt like I couldn't move. I remember shaking and twitching and trying to scream for help . I remember thinking I was having a stroke I couldn't move at all expect for my hands twitching. I hallucinate my partner came home from work , I hallcunated getting up and a spray bottle attacking me and me screaming so loud.i imagined getting and then collapsing on the floor.  I hallucinated different people coming and speaking to me through the door. Everytime I thought I was awake I never was. I managed to roll over and stuff but I just couldn't snap out of it. I remember it all and there is just too much shig to write down . But all I know is that they were hallucinations and not dreams . I just know it was not the same . Because it was like even when I was awake it still happening . I finally woke up properly but now I feel very derealised from reality . I have no idea what is real or not. I'm worried people will think I was just dreaming but I know what I just went through and I need to find answers.  


Please tell me someone knows what happened ? I know about lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis . But it just doesn't feel like that . It's the first time I have ever truelly seen things and heard things that were not there. And I felt like I was stuck in a horrendous loop .  

Please note I will be going to the doctors and talking about everything,  I will be trying to better my sleeping too , so any advice on that I would greatly appriciate x",mentalhealth

I currently can't really afford to seek help from a mental health professional and if there's any place or forum where I can get advice from one for free.

I have been on antidepressants before because I was going through a very stressful period in my life and the high amounts of anxiety also resulted in me getting depressed. but also in general I am a very anxious person and I have noticed that my brain never truly quiets down. I hadn't before explored to what extent it doesn't quite down, like I already knew that every time I tried to meditate my brain wouldn't allow itself a moment of silence and what kind of bringing thoughts against my will, and like the thoughts are always so random too.

but recently I've also noticed that anytime I truly try to get my brain to quiet down, in the off chance when there is no thoughts in my brain there's always some sort of song playing in the background, even when I haven't heard the song in a very long time. I can't really make it stop unless I switch songs or distract myself somehow. and I think it's always been like that to some extent but it's just now that I'm truly truly noticing it and that it's starting to bother me.

P.S. I have never truly been diagnosed with something but I have my suspicions that I might suffer from some sort of anxiety disorder, maybe even some sort of depression disorder. I don't think I'm neurodivergent either.

1697519959.0,my aha moment,"hi guys, today i had a little revelation. while many of you might have already figured this out, it's something i just recently discovered. i wanted to share this newfound insight to forgive myself for times when i may not have been as compassionate or understanding as i'd like to be in certain situations. it's also a way of helping others by sharing what i've learned today.

one thing i've realized is that we tend to downplay someone else's trauma or mental health issues. for instance, i once heard about a friend's trauma, and it seemed small to me, something i could easily brush off with my mental capacity. however, when i had to deal with my own trauma, it felt like the worst thing in the world.

now, i can see that my friend's trauma might have felt as significant to them as mine does to me upon knowing that there might be people who even think that my issue is something they can brush off as well. it's not about comparison because everyone's mental health capacity is different, and they deal with situations based on that capacity. no matter how big or small an issue may seem, it can profoundly affect someone. so, i learnt to avoid saying things like, 'your issue isn't that big; i deal with so much more,' because we might not know the significance of the situation to that person and what it's associated with.

this is what i've realized, and i wanted to share it with everyone here as a reminder to help those around us, no matter how significant or insignificant their issues may appear to us. you never know how much it means to them and what it represents in their lives.

so, i learnt to be more available and understanding towards people who matter to me and who deserves to be heard. i learnt that i should reach out to peeps when they're down, big or small issues and being that friend who listens. after all, a small act can make a big impact. let's all create a world where everyone's struggles are respected.",mentalhealth

I don't remember how it feels to be happy until I'm happy, and then I remember it for an hour or two, and forget again. Same with basically every emotion. And pain too. The only thing I actually remember is strict information. Visuals, things I hear, some smells, line of events and the thoughts at the moment of the memory. Other than that it's basically blank.

For a week I was constant dealing with panic and stress and anxiety so I started thinking like I died and Im still sleeping and wont wake up ever again, started thinking that when I wake up I wont recognize my family, my wife and I was so sad about that, I was thinking that I will forget everything in my life.

After that I went to a neurologist (i have migraine) and I asked him why my hands and my feet shake and feel totally numb, same as my head?

they made a test like if I was good with my motor movements and the doc told me that You only have anxiety u weel anxious and dont read or think bad things because thats what it will trigger more.

After that I checked some of my meds that I use for migraine, Sumatriptan was one of them and started reading that sumatriptan if its used to much it will cause loss of memory... so while reading and remembering the night i smoked i got in a loop that I was dead Im not living a normal life anymore.

So now Im ok i took control about my emotions and thoughts, i feel better and Im not getting a numb leg/hand/head or anything. I started feeling normal now but sometimes I get some intrusive thoughts for ex Im really happy and our of a sudden my mind says ""wait are you feeling this moment for real?"" and I understand that the anxiety will hit me and I try to control it for like 1 min and I feel better.

I would like to know if anyone was the same and did anyone else overcome all of this situation, Im just worried about if Ill stay on this forever, or if it will affect my marriage, my family knows about this right now I told them.

I don't have a diagnosis of anything specific but I see a psychologist for anxiety and depression related symptoms that mostly only manifest in bigger issues at work. I had an overly critical and mood swinging mother so I get really sensitive to other people's bad moods.  

Does anyone have any tools or reading I could have a look at about how to let go of bad emotions after a fight with a friend?  I feel like there's an emotional side and logical side of me and while I've said constantly to myself, you can't control other people, you can only control how you react, after a fight about something stupid where someone has said something really cruel and unfair to me, all I can keep doing is circling on the argument and feeling guilty like I've done something wrong, but logically I know I haven't. For whatever reason, they were in a bad mood or stressed and snapped at me.  

I can't logic myself out of feeling shitty and guilty and like I've caused it, I've tried to accept I couldn't do anything different, but its hanging around like a grey aura and making me feel like I can't do any of the hobbies I like to take my mind off it, and can't stop feeling like I hate myself and I'm worthless and I just can't watch TV or crochet, or read a book.  I feel trapped in a vortex of misery.

I can't resolve it because they've blocked me on social media and to be honest its probably not a good time so soon after to try and fix it.  I don't know what to do, or what CBT or mental health lessons or books to read about the above type of thing.

I don't know who to turn to at this point, I'm so emotionally detached trying to score some  sympathy points.
i just want some validation of my struggle, some understanding of what I'm going through. The only reason why I'm holding a job is cause it's work from home otherwise I'd be on the streets.

1697538806.0,Am I depressed?,"I’m in my 30’s and have always struggled in life. I have a decent life now, but nothing came easy. 
I come from a lower middle class family and being the eldest child to a single parent , I feel I grew up differently than my younger siblings. Though the financial burden wasn’t on me, I became a second parent. I feel I conditioned myself into becoming a protector/provider and made sure I didn’t show any weakness to my family and tried to be a role model to my younger siblings. 
For every obstacle in life, I didn’t give myself an option to fail. Only goal in life has been , work hard - get ahead in life.
But recently I have been feeling if I was too harsh on myself. I feel deprived of a childhood. I was never a child. Also being older to my sibling by several years,  I feel they don’t connect to me as they do with each other. They avoid sharing things with me like how they avoid talking to my parent. 
I am breaking down now thinking all my life I did everything for my family/siblings , but now I am not a part of it. 
We all live in different cities now , and while my siblings talk to each other very often , they never call me. Unless I call them , we never speak. 
I do love them all very much. But mentally I’m breaking down.

1697538139.0,I can’t explain what my problem is and how I feel,"Around 6 month ago I broke up with my boyfriend, we had a really toxic relationship and I became really jealous. I started to believe I am a covert narcissist, broke up with him because I felt like I am only hurting him and went into psychosis for about a month. For the past 6 month I feel like something is missing in me. I started going to a therapist but I feel like I can’t explain him what my problem is. We did some tests and I was quite low on narcissism but I am not sure if I can completely be honest about myself or if I am lying to myself. If there is a question like if I am having feelings of griosity, I somehow can’t find an answer to it. I don’t know if I feel that. He asked me if I saw my boyfriend as an competitor, but I don’t know if I did. If I am trying to reflect on my self I don’t know how. I don’t know how reflecting works or what it is, what it means to reflect. I wonder what self reflection is, I wonder what empathy is and how it feels like. I have really no idea about anything anymore. I feel so different and I can’t explain what it is. I wonder if I just lost my false self and I actually am a narcissist. I feel like my heart is closed off from everything. I feel so stuck in myself. I can’t really engage with my environment as I used too. People always describe me as sunshine and if I entered a room people felt fine and comfortable but I completely lost that. When I wake up in the morning I feel such a weird sensation. On the one hand my whole body feels so loose on the other hand it feels like the whole me is compressed to a little package that’s stored somewhere in my body . I don’t feel depressed but I can’t move forward. I wanted to finish my bachelorthesis in June, but I have nothing yet. I don’t have anything to do but I just don’t feel like working on it. My heart feels so cold. I am constantly thinking about myself and what is wrong with me, trying to explain it to myself but it’s without any results because I probably am just not able to self reflect. I think okay maybe it’s because of this or that, but I don’t know what is true and what is not. I am worried that therapy can’t help me because I can’t explain what my problem is and when I am in therapy I feel quite normal and laughing a lot and being open. I am scared that without seeing any improvement in myself he doesn’t see the necessaty of the Therapy because I don’t have a specific problem and he doesn’t know how to help me if I can’t explain what is wrong with me and thinks that everything is fine even though it’s not. I used to have a routine but I don’t anymore. I have cooked 3 times in the past 6 month where before I cooked 3 times a day. When I am around people I feel so closed off I just can’t engage I just grab out my phone and disengage. Before when I felt like I had a mental problem I always felt like there is an explanation for it or I found something on the internet that described what is wrong, also even though when I was alone I didn’t feel good I felt like around people I was still myself. I feel like I should cry but I can’t. I feel like everything could just be normal but it isn’t. I don’t feel anxiety as I once used too. It feels more like my body is getting stiff if I feel uncomfortable but I actually don’t know if I really feel that. I have no idea about anything anymore. I know I am not myself but I don’t know what’s different. Even though I feel like I have felt worse before, when I felt depressed, had anxiety, derealisation and depersonalization, it never felt as weird and hopeless for improvement as it does now.",mentalhealth

They will probably do surgery on him tomorrow (well today now, 2am) to move the breathing tube from the mouth to the neck so he’s more comfortable and to see if he can breathe on his own. I told my employer my situation and they are putting me on a 3-week leave of absence, which means no pay for 3 weeks.

Yesterday at 3pm my brother calls me saying that he’s at the emergency vet with my dog, Pluto a little chihuahua. He was attacked by my cousins vicious pitbull. But at first my brother told me it was my other dog, Astro a German shepherd which I knew was false because Astro is super friendly and submissive. The nurse tells us he was stable and his Temperature was going back to normal that my brother and cousin could leave if they needed to do other things. So I left the hospital and went to the vet and by the time I got there (public transport) they had taken cat scans and nurse tells me his breathing tube? or I think might’ve been his voice box, was shattered, and his jaw was fractured. She said she’s not worried about the jaw but the neck one it could be bad. She recommended we euthanize him due to his age and said other things but I just couldn’t hear them.

1697533563.0,Should I get a second assessment or is this normal?,"Hi all - I was diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder back in 2016. I would regularly go through periods of intense lows (usually every 6-12 month-ish, sometimes longer). They were often triggered by something but not always. I would end up back at the docs for SSRI meds and then rinse and repeat..

Last month I had a huge depressive episode and ended up being assessed at a psych hospital. I'd recently quit smoking cannabis and was having some relationship difficulties.. then out of nowhere I just completely dissociated and don't really remember much of the whole process. I've had the intensive home treatment team come out to see me daily and my family were keeping an eye on me.

After speaking with some of my family & friends now the fog has cleared a bit, and also giving myself some time to reflect on why I get like this.. etc.. I realised I behave very odd in between my depressive episodes.

I'm an absolute commitmaphobe and have never lived with or moved in with a girl (I'm nearly 35).. I'm very unstable in the relationship but I wouldn't say I have a fear of abandonment per se, I just feel I want it, then I don't... then I question if it's right... and then I desperately want her back.. etc..

I'm also an incredibly impulsive and selfish person.. setting up business ventures, staying up late researching ideas and investing in start-up equipment often costing me a fortune... however, it's awesome when I'm doing it but often my mood changes and I abandon.

I'm also incredibly irritable and and often on the edge which has lead to physical confrontations before.

I'm just worried about how I can be as my lows seem to be getting more intense with age and also more unpredictable. The most recent one was concerning as it was the first time I actively felt like making a plan to end it. There wasn't a specific trigger which warranted such a huge deline.

Is this typical of recurrent depressive disorder? Or should I perhaps go back to my GP and discuss this? I'm always quite careful when it comes to labelling myself, but certain traits and behaviour at the moment are making life very difficult.

I'm currently on 100mg of Sertraline.

Thanks.

I found out the real kind of person they were which wasn't a very nice person. I only lasted a month before I was worried I would do something I wouldn't be able to regret. 

Instead I took a step back from those thoughts and plans and called someone in a nearby state closer than my original home before moving in and asked for help to get me out. To this day I've said the people who got me out saved me but until last year never told them exactly what that meant. 

On the day I moved out I got blocked and I was blocked for 3 years. When I was finally getting over everything, realizing how bad the situation was, and not missing the friendship as much anymore, they unblocked me and added me to a group message trying to plan a trip. 

For the last year and a half I haven't been able to get everything about that person and the situation out of my head. I have no closure and I want it. I wrote up a whole message stating how I felt with everything that happened and how I'm feeling about it all now and part of me wants to send it to my ex best friend and see if that gives me closure. 

The other part of me thinks that I'm just never gonna have closure and will just be stuck on this. My partner thinks I'm too stuck on it which makes me want to send the message, but at the same time I want to talk to my partner about me having a message I want to send and I want them to tell me it's okay to send the message. I might send it regardless of what my partner says, but I don't want it hidden. 

I just don't know whether I should send the message. Could it really help give me closure cause I finally get to explain myself when I was never given the chance before? Do I tell my partner and how do I even bring it up when my partner has already expressed a dislike in how much mental energy I've unfortunately put into the situation.

Now, he’s moved back to our hometown. His depression has gotten BAD and that’s all we talk about. He expects me to be there for him always and it’s getting too exhausting. We literally only talk about his issues every time we meet or when he calls. He just feels low all the time and he doesn’t even feel like the same best friend I had back in high school.

We were all hanging out eating food and having a pretty good time, and got back to this persons dorm, I’ll call “I”. Even though we’re a bit awkward I thought everything was good. But anyways we were play fighting and joking around, and I said I dislike him. You would know it was sarcasm because of the statements I had said before, and I said it in a joking manner.

I proceeds to go “I don’t like you.” I kind of prod him because sometimes when he talks his face is really serious and I genuinely can’t tell if he’s joking or not, so I said “you really don’t like me? What did I do?” also in a joking manner, because with these kinds of things, becoming serious kind of ruins the vibe. He then hesitates staring me into my eyes, almost like he’s thinking of what specifically he doesn’t like about me, and then he goes “I just don’t like you. I’ll tell you why in a year.” keep in mind our dorming arrangements are usually different by year, so maybe that’s what he was referring to. That we’d stop being friends in a year and he would tell me then? 

Still, it really irked me and left me with this feeling weighing on my chest that’s causing me to feel like I was just punched in the gut. I don’t know if I’m just reading into it too much or it’s just that something about my autism he doesn’t like because it gives off “uncanny valley effect” or something, and allistic people tend to have a natural aversion to autistic people, because we actually think, and whenever they see us thinking and in that moment completely unmasked, somewhere subconsciously they take a note of that “unnatural behavior”. 

I might just be playing in my tendency to be neurotic and blame myself, but ever since I was young, a lot of people just straight up didn’t like me and I never knew why, and this is making me feel like the little kid who was always treated like shit again. And the thing is he looked like he actually meant what he said, but the others around us just took it as a joke, even though one of them said his name almost like “why would you say that?” 

What do you think he actually meant by what he said?",mentalhealth

I'm 32M, married with a 1.5 year old son. I think I'm suffering from depression and I think this started when my son was born. I don't think ""depression"" captures everything but it is the closest definition I have at the moment.

  
I feel like life does not bring me enjoyment. The only thing that I live for is to pay the bills and support my family. I don't have any hobbies or things I do for myself because I don't have the time or money for it.

  
I wake up at 5am to be at work for 7am every day. Pick up my son at 5pm from daycare and take care of him with my wife until his bed at 730/8 pm. Once he's asleep, I have about 2 hours to take care of whatever it is I need to do before my own bedtime at 10/1030pm.

  
I don't smoke, occasionally have a beer or a glass of wine with dinner. My exercise is walking the dog 2x a day for 30 mins. 

  
I'm constantly exhausted. I have no energy or desire to do anything. 

  
I have completely lost my libido and I hate the fact that I don't feel any arousal or desire intimacy anymore. I feel like nothing brings me joy anymore.

1697527221.0,How to limit and deal with this mindset and overthinking,"most of the time i presume the worse and adjust myself on it like worst case scenario. But I don't like being be overly optimistic i wanna realistic prospectives 



Like when someone don't reply i presume i fucked up with something and overthink about that or they don't like me or whatever i know it's overthinking and social anxiety that people like me might need assurance which i don't like tbh . And i rethink over and over on what happened and revisit everything focusing on unimportant details which create sensitivity when i interact with people 


So yeah even i didn't do anything wrong i always jump to the possibility that i did something wrong or said something stupid which lead to overthinking and misunderstanding and taking responsibility for stuff i don't even relate to on my shoulders which become unnecessary burden


I don't even presume that someone hurt me at first which is mostly likely the case maybe i need to selfish abit

1697526984.0,Heed advice,"So my friend of 4+ years has been a little if lately, I've done my best to keep an eye out for any signs of what's happening cuse I'm concerned about him 

He's recently been threw a break up witch hasent helped his mood but I did what I could there without involving myself too much as that's between the 2 of them and nothing to do with me 

He's also been affected by one of his best friends committing suicide, don't know much about this bit as its one of his friends back home. But I do know it stings when he remembers anything to do with it. I would like for him to talk about it more to relive the felling about it but not gonna force it 

Now is where this gets personal about him and he asked me not to say anything to anyone of our friends, which I'm not but I still need advice on what to do 

We where out drinking a few nights ago having a good time, now only mentioning this as its relifent to the story but I've recently started to speak to this other boy who I fancy and he was on the night out with use, plus my best friend is straight so he not Jealous or anything, infact he helped the 2 of use get together.

But anyway on the night out he's seen me being really extaticly happy and he mentions it a few times which I cringed at but did say yes I am. Now he did seem OK at this point nothing out of the norm but was a little sus at this. So later on in the night is where it went a bit down hill 

He asked be to go for a fag which I won't refuse but only me as he wanted to talk, so I was like OK no prob just let me tell David [potential bf] that where away for a smoke 

We got out side and chatted a bit like normal then ne got really weird, he first of wasn't gona say till the next morning which got my attention so I was like you can't tell a bitch that and not expect me to ask questions 

Now thus went on for a bit to the point where I was concerned that he wasn't telling me anything 

He eventually told me ""do you ever just not bothered with the whole thing ""

I knew exactly what he was talking about and I've even got his confirmation that's what's it was about 

Now he threatened our friendship if I said to anyone of our friends so I'm not gona do that 
I told him any feelings of doing something stupid you get on the phone to me right away, and possibly speak to someone professional about this which he said no too but that side of the story isn't done yet cause I will get him into the mind set of speaking to someone as I'm all well and good talking ot out But I'm no professional 

He made me promise to act normally the rest of the night witch I did but keeped an eye out on him as best I could 

But I just don't know what to think or do I can't have my best friend be going threw this alone and potentially do something stupid ill be damed if it gets that far, and I hope that he's not thinking now I have a potential bf that I'm gona forget about him cause that ain't gona happen

1697526879.0,Throwing up bile every morning... stress?!,"Hooo boy this is a sexy one, apologies in advance.

So... I've been throwing up every morning. Not food, nothing I've eaten or drank ever comes up, it's always just a yellowish bile. This has happened twice before in my life; once when I was working a job that made me suicidal, and once when I was working a job where I was in constant conflict with my boss.

Work right now is hella busy pressure so I have to conclude that this is tied to my job (like... the thing you do 9 hours per day is obviously going to have a major mental health impact). But what the hell do I do? I'm self-employed now, work isn't ever going to be not-stressful.

CBT is useless. It's just 'have you thought about *not* being stressed lol?' I was put on citalopram once for anxiety and it was the worst two weeks of my life, no meds. Has anyone experienced this, and have they found anything that helps?

All my life in radio I have noticed this.   If I am working at any time during the day, my stress level is high and my lack of focus keeps me from working on simple, yet mundane audio projects (editing multiple episodes of a radio show for example)

However, as night time approaches, it seems my stress level goes down slowly.  Change it up for a moment and let's say I have to fill in for someone on overnight shift.  (12a to 8a)
My mental clarity, awareness, calm, peace and ability to focus is amplified greatly.   I have always been this way.   Is this a symptom of ADHD or generally hitting the lowest level of cortisol in my body for the day (as we all know, cortisol <stress hormone> starts out high as we wake up)

1697526339.0,Any suggestions help,"I (27M) am just getting to a point where I am only living to make sure I don't hurt those that would be affected by my passing. I don't feel suicidal in the sense that I want to die, I just feel like I haven't had much purpose as of late. I'm very much a homebody and that self-isolation has killed all relationships I had with friends, leaving me without much of a social network and I have never been one to share much of the emotions that I am feeling. Last year I was involved in a brief relationship where the girl liked me a lot, but being in a not so great mental place, I eventually drove her away with my own self-sabatoging tactics, but we remained friends. Fast-forward to the last 3 months I have felt more able to feel emotions, and really began to develop feelings for the same girl, who now has a boyfriend. We texted all the time and played games, and she expressed that she was having feelings for me again, however, she doesn't really know what she wants in life right now, and doesn't feel comfortable blowing up her life. I don't blame her decision, as I hurt her pretty badly in the past, so it all feels like it's come full circle and I got what I deserved, a broken heart for a broken heart. This girl is important to me, so I want to continue to be friends if I can handle that. Some of how I feel is because this happened recently, but this feeling of no purpose and being alive and functional for others has been something in my mind for a while. Just not really sure how to find purpose in a life that I keep self-sabatoging due to fear, and not sure where to start picking up the pieces.

1697526081.0,Need help understanding what I am dealing with,"For some background info, I am an autistic (self diagnose after countless hours poured into the DMSs diagnostic requirements for autism as well as anecdotes from autistic teens and adults, I'm not in a situation currently where I can get a professional diagnosis) 18 year old person who struggles with mental health issues. I grew up as a ""gifted"" kid, and unfortunately was sexually groomed from the ages 14-16 causing me to self harm as well as attempt suicide, which I believe caused some sort of trauma related amnesia as I have very little recollection of those years.

Recently, I have been struggling a lot with my mental health and I suspect it has to do with some type of mental disorder, as much of it seems to stem from nothing at all. To begin, I very often dissociate or go into a state of derealization, typically whenever topics surrounding pedophilia, self harm, or suicide are mentioned. While it is sometimes triggered by those topics, it also happens randomly some days and leads to me not being able to tell what is reality and what isn't/recalling events as a dream I had only to learn later it actually happened. I also have been dealing with manic and depressive episodes often, and along with my depressive episodes I also get into these thought loops about horrible things like self harm, suicide, rape, and more that seem to never end and prevent me from being able to sleep a lot of the time. I think a lot of it stems from anxiety, but as I mentioned I am having lots of issues with dissociation which gives me a lot of ""brain fog"" and makes it difficult for me to pinpoint my emotions and thoughts during these episodes.

I originally believed I was dealing with schizotypal personality disorder as well as bipolar disorder because of what I have been experiencing. However, I'm having trouble recognizing whether or not schizotypal is something I could be dealing with because many of the antisocial and ""weird"" traits that are seen in schizotypal are similar to traits of autism, and I have built compensatory mechanisms for my social awkwardness which allow me to function as a ""normal"" member of society.

I would like to get a psych panel or evaluation so I can hopefully seek treatment (whether its through medication or through therapy) but unfortunately I am in a household which is very anti-diagnosis and do not have access to that resource right now.

Just for some timeframes, I am having manic and depressive episodes around 8 or 9 times a month each, derealizing every day or every other day, having thought loops about every other day, and having thoughts of suicide or self harm about one in three days.

1697496603.0,I've tried therapy twice and it doesn't feel like it's made any difference,"There are many things I could list that I don't like about myself. I don't really get any satisfaction from life. I have no friends, no hobbies. I have difficulty trusting people. I have difficulty concentrating on things. I get anxious about things like making phonecalls and put them off until the thing I need to call about is too urgent to be ignored. I manage to pay my bills well enough but that's just surviving. Life isn't worth living unless you're, well, *living*.

I first tried going to therapy 5 years ago through the UK's NHS. The therapist was empathetic but the system itself didn't really seem to care; I was given a form every session with questions like ""on a scale of 1 to 10 how likely are you to hurt yourself?"" and because I was low-risk they just wanted me out the door.

I tried again early this year through private health insurance who had to choose my therapist for me (I only seem to be able to choose my own if I pay out-of-pocket) and we barely discussed anything. Every session we re-treaded the exact same thing, I felt like we were going in circles. I'd say I dislike how little I enjoy life, and how I don't have any hobbies. He'd ask ""does it *matter* if you don't have any hobbies?"" And I say ""I suppose technically no but-"" and he'd say ""then what's the problem?""

But I also don't want to ignore the possibility that *I'm* the problem. That maybe I expected therapy to be a magic fix that can be done *to* me without me putting in any extra effort. Maybe I'm just stubborn and have a shitty personality that refuses to work on myself.",mentalhealth

I have always been fun, life od the party one might say, but also lately I just don’t feel being it anymore. I started drinking way too much in these social occasions, just to keep up the appearances.

I feel irritated and frustrated and finally this culminated when I punched the guy in the face after he spent good 1 hour provoking me, I just lost it, he walked past me and “flicked” the hat off my head like I am a child…

I feel ashamed and stupid and I do believe I need to talk to somebody, to seek professional help.",mentalhealth

There have always been days when I feel good and communicative, but since coming out I’ve lost all of my confidence. My stutter is creeping back and every time I speak to people, I feel this intense panic that only goes away when I’m alone. 

I don’t know what to do about it. As a server, I think it’s beginning to affect my work. Again, this didn’t feel like it was as much of a problem before, so I don’t know what to do about it. I’m so desperate to stay quiet, but I’m too self conscious to try to communicate with a notepad. The other day I felt this compulsion to clam up that I’ve never experienced before and it was quite overwhelming. I wanted to squish my face with my hands. Does anyone else feel this way about how they talk and interact? What can I do to work on this?",mentalhealth

I am not really sure where this post is meant to be headed, but I kind of wanted to just write my thoughts. I was watching a video about not wanting to exist and why its such a common thing that is so rarely addressed and in the video, the commenter was explaining how not wanting to exist is different from wanting to di3. Not wanting to exist is simply just wanting to disappear; no pain, and no difficulty. Just disappearing. But then this kind of got my wheels turning about wanting to di3. In head head I started thinking how wanting to di3 is more then just simply not wanting to live, but it’s wanting to end suffering and pain. It really took me aback because from what I was thinking, wanting to di3 almost sounds like using pain to end pain? It really gave me more of a perspective into the mind of suicid3 and simply put it, I guess understand what it means to want to di3; its giving up hope in all other options. You feel like you’ve exhausted everything else, so you resort to using pain, to end your pain.",mentalhealth

1697517956.0,"Feel low at night, but low in the mornings too.","I struggle a lot. I've not self harmed for over I think now eight weeks.

My main problems are leaving the house, I can't stand it, I used to be fine but it's gotten worse since I lost my dog two years back. I could always get out with him at least at the weekends, or when I had my last job which was only ten minutes away, I knew my route, my times, and so on - now I have to get a bus which at first was a struggle (I am 33) because I wasn't in control of my commute, but I'm okay with it most of the time.

Recently I've just really noticed, the worst time, is actually the morning. I wake up at 5AM, do my blood sugar levels and have a coffee, watch some youtube (come around really) for half an hour, then shower, eat, shave and leave. But it's in this time, right now, as I have to get up and go and I just, sometimes I really just can't - I do, but it's forced because I live alone with a mortgage, so as down as I am, I have to keep going to work no matter what for the money.

I normally have either a couple of beers, or a smoke (I know, but it helps) in the evening to slow my head down, so I can go to sleep - but I've got nothing at the moment, and can't drink too often as firstly, I don't really enjoy it, and secondly, I have a job to hold down so I can't go in hungover. So last night was a dreadful nights sleep because my head just would not stop talking to me to the point I had to shout 'shut up' out loud, I think I eventually got off around 1ish so I'm on four hours roughly.

My head goes in circles like I say, every avenue I look at to fix things is prevented by another problem I've made, so I literally get stuck in no mans land, there's not much use talking to professionals, because I can't follow much of their advice in all honesty, because there's problems everywhere I turn.

For example, at the moment;

\- I dislike my job

(But I can't leave, because everyone knows and accepts I don't do much socialising and just want to work)

\- my debt is ever increasing

(I can't control my finances, I'm embarrassed about the state I'm already in, so unable to seek help)

\- my health feels like it's getting worse every day

(I can't do jobs that'll involve a bigger commute, because I know I'll be exhausted by the time I get there)

I also did something really stupid, out of loneliness, and bought a pup a couple weeks back. Work colleagues know I've been missing Frank massively and so they were all super pleased, and I did feel good, until he came home and I realized I was trying to hold down a job, and look after a little pup. So I had to make the heart-breaking decision to let him go and I am really beating myself up for it, not only the wasted money, but I now get asked about him a lot, but can't bring myself to admit I failed and now I've got myself in a circle of lies saying he's with family and that I've not got my phone, so no photos.

Sorry, ended up on a bit of a waffle. But yeah, is it normal to feel low, or consider silly things in the morning? it feels like it never stops.

1697517588.0,Not too sure what to title this,"19m, when I was 18 I starting smoking weed and I really got into it I smoked almost everyday usually for the entire day,(smoked from june 2022 to February 2023). In early February 2023 I had ran low and only smoked like 3 times in a 2 week span and during that time i felt off while sober, I don’t really know how to describe it(I might be saying that a lot in this post) but then I was at a friends and I was just thinking about random stuff and i thought about something that made me anxious and I started having a bad high so I went up to my friends, told them so they could help calm me down, I joined their conversation and they were talking about beyond crazy conspiracy theories that they believed in and I consumed all of that information and it freaked me the fuck out. For the next 2 days I didn’t smoke and I was constantly thinking about what they were saying and I was anxious all day, then 3 days after the conversation I got way too high for my own liking  at my friends and i starting thinking about the conversation which made me beyond anxious. I haven’t smoked weed since that day it’s been 9 months now. But since then life has not felt real at all. It was pretty much constant for the first 3 months or so but then it got better only feeling like that for either a day or a couple weeks at a time. My girlfriend says it could be psychosis but I’m not sure. Does anyone know what could have happened and how I can deal with this? It feels like I’m not the same person I was before that conversation.

Edit: for that 3 months where it was bad, like the first month or 2 I was thinking about the conversation constantly worried about the shit they said now I’m good not worried about the stuff at all but I still have the feeling life isn’t real.

1697517087.0,Severe anxiety that is has taken over my life.,"So for the past 3 months I've gone through very severe anxiety out of nowhere. It started with me waking up from shakes and diarrhea and that went on for a few days. I did a blood check and ultra sounded my organs, everything was clear. Then I started working through a lot of my emotional trauma with my dad and my past, it was fine and dandy up until I fixated on one thing.

So in 2020 I was quite stupid and I'd party a lot. I went over to my friend's place a few times and she had this thc vape thingy. Me being the dude that loves weed I took a few drags of it for like 5 times every weekend or so for about a month. We'd have smoke sessions and all, last time I did it in 2020 I got a little anxiety for 15 minutes then it went away. I stopped doing it and later I find out it's not actually weed, it's this synthetic thc that I did. Although when I did it, it felt like a normal high and nothing really happened to me when I smoked it. After I stopped I didn't get any withdrawls. So fast-forward to now 3 years later, it's all I think about. It's killing me because of how stupid I was and how easily I could've avoided it. There's nothing good about it and everything I search about it is horrible, I hear horror stories everywhere, I'm afraid I somehow fucked my brain up for good and nothing is helping me get out of this mindset. I did therapy, I went to a neorlogist, I talked to friends and family I opened up. I meditated, I'm eating somewhat healthy. Nothing is working and it's killing me.

I know that it's out of my system and I know that brain recovers and all. But I fear that I have done something that has fucked my future up for good. These are research chemicals and no one knows what it does. I'm desperate, I don't know what to do and I need your help. This is so specific and I have no one to relate to, like I would've been fine if I did any other hard drug tbh but not this....this is terrifying. I keep thinking my life is over. I really fucked up this time.

1697515462.0,"I stop having contact with the family of my partner. I want and need to get over it, so I can continue with my life.","I have been through some bad things almost 2 years now, broken bone, broken family, lost job, house, etc. Due to all the prior things, I have tried to just focused in my mental health, all my decisions have been based on that, although it seems like my choices haven't been the best ones. 

Long story, I'm not native English speaker, if you have advice for my grammar I will appreciate.

I have a really small business where I sell pet stuff, but since I didn't have a place to store my things anymore. I had to temporarily left the things in the ""house"" of my partner's family. I left them a Thursday, on Friday $15,000(not dollars) worthy of my stuff was stolen. In this house, only the mother of my partner lives let's call her Susan and there's a mechanic that rents the yard to work for only $300 to the grandparents. What I was told is that Susan left the mechanic in charge of the house because she was leaving for a few hours, when she returned the things were gone.

Context: The house is from nobody, the family of my partner technically took the house when the owner abandoned it and the mother is living there cause she has nowhere to go, but the house is practically falling down.

The mechanic said that he was in the door all the time and no one entered, that we didn't had all those things stolen and that she was lying. Pretty suspicious obviously (take this in mind for later).

We discussed the robbery with the family and to my surprise they took the mechanic's side, saying they could not do anything, and that it was our fault for not closing the room (take into account that it was in the second floor not at first sight).

Weeks go by, and the mechanic now accused us of stealing him like $100 worth of things. He proceeds to threatened our life's and to damage my motorcycle. We were so scared that we closed the house and change the lock to prevent him to enter the house.

Well, it turns out that the grandparents want us to let him enter the house, they did not care for the threats. We refuse obviously, for the our safety and Susan's safety, we stayed with her a few days to care for her. 

Again weeks go by, and everything starts going worse to worse, the grandparent went to the house with the mechanic and more people, when we arrived they tried to hit my partner and were really violent. The grandparent is telling us to open the door, we get into a verbal fight ( the grandson of the mechanic  admitted he stole our things), ended calling the police. 

After all of that, they are talking behind my back telling everyone that I'm a bi***, that I'm brainwashing my partner and his mom. Also, the house is like a storage for some working people of the market, and they are saying that things have been stolen before and no one is saying anything that I shouldn't complain and that I'm exaggerating, that the mechanic is taking legal action for something invented of course, and they start making excuses and inventing gossips, telling them to family in order for they to come and hit us.

At this point, we were soo confuse, so sad, so disappointed that we didn't know what to do because nothing made sense. All of this takes us to the last day were I exploited. Before this day, I haven't said much, but they broke me. They have told Susan that the mechanic was going back we wanted or not because they needed the rent money for her candy and soda. We even offered to pay for that, but that wasn't the problema, we don't understand it yet. I decided that it was enough, I didn't have much money but I preferred to take my stuff to a storage and forget about all of this.

A few hour go by, and I received a message from Susan with screenshots of the father of my partner saying bullsh** about me because he saw the post where I was looking for a storage. Saying that I was dramatic that I was been such and such for trying to get my stuff out of the house. I had enough went to him and told him that we needed to talk, he refused to do it, and then started to get violent towards me (all of this in front of the flea market) I lost my patience and told him to stop saying those things about me, that I didn't understand why they were doing all of this if my partner was his family, the grandparents start talking sh**t about me and both the father and grandfather tried to hit me. My partner noticed the fight and came and started fighting also with his family, he told me to go somewhere else to calm down because I was really bad. They didn't want to let me take my things out, my partner almost had a physical fight with his father, at the end I could take my things out.

This was not the first time that we stopped talking to them for things like this one, we had to communicate again because I needed to work in the flea market and it was in front of the house. This was just so traumatic for my partner and I that we are broken, we are depressed and is affecting our lifes. I had nightmares and can't stop thinking about all of the things that happened. I want to get over it, and I don't have outside comfort or advice, I actually don't have anyone to talk about all of the things that happened to us, just my partner and I.

I just have been through a lot, I was in a really bad situation before this happened and all of this is just mentally stopping me from doing the things that I have to do  like  increasing my small business, finishing my social work and my thesis. I'm just trying to survive, sometimes I don't even have money to eat. We both have been trying to get a job, but where we are temporarily (small town) no one hire us, even the fabrics. All we have is my small business and is not going that great, I'm trying to do my best but I guess I have to wait for the good results at least that's what I hope for because I have been fighting to have a better life.",mentalhealth

1697513420.0,Any advice on arachnophobia?,"It's honestly pretty bad. I'm sort of okay with daddy long legs (I know they're not actually spiders, IDGAF, my brain sees a spider) because they just stay in their corner and don't move very fast. Ditto for orb weavers. If it's really, really tiny, like grain of rice tiny, I'm okay with that, too. 

 But it's goddamn giant house spider season, and I am seeing a legitimate decrease in my own functionality. It's worse this year than others, I think because there are just more of them (must be the weather or something - fall appeared early and hit pretty hard). I'd say there's a 70% chance I'll find one if I go in the laundry room for the past month. When I see one, I just immediately fall apart. I run away shrieking and can't even move until my husband kills it and disposes of the body. For like an hour+ afterwards, I'm all rattled and I lose my appetite. 

 It's been an issue since I was a little kid. It's a weird story, but I think it started when I had a terrible nightmare about a creepy house full of spiders when I was about five. If I try to get to the root of, it seems to have something to do with how unrelatable they are. They have no visible face, and all those legs, and they act like they're in their own little world (and omfg I hate them they're so creepy!). And, you know, they're in my house. I screamed my face off when a bird got in once, and I love birds. 

 What are some things I can do at home to cope with this? I'm starting to get fed up with these little bastards running my life. And I need to do laundry, damnit.

1697499723.0,Any of you depression heads have this as well? Or any insight?,"Ok, so, I am already diagnosed with a bunch of stuff (ADHD, MDD, GAD), so I know that I have many issues, I am currently taking various meds to help (Lamotragine, Buproprion, Vyvanse, and some multivitamins and they seem to help a little), and I am regularly seeing a psychiatrist, but I am still struggling very often.

The thing I am looking for advice about is this: During the day, basically every day and multiple times a day, I will go from feeling 'normal' and happy to completely depressed. When I am sitting at my desk I will feel happy and content for a bit, and then after an hour or two (sometimes more depending on what's going on) I feel very, very depressed (Complete lack of energy and enthusiasm to do anything, dwelling thoughts about past mistakes and current issues, that sort of thing). 

I have been smoking a lot of weed, which yes probably doesn't help, but this stuff was happening long before I started smoking, so I doubt that's the thing **causing** this. I am currently on a T break for 2 weeks, so I'll wait and see if that clears things up.

I think I mostly just want to know, do any of you guys get this stuff too? I hear about cycles of depression and bipolar and whatnot, but the stuff I hear is usually about longer term cycles over the course of months, but my mood can change very rapidly throughout the day. I don't really see stuff describing my specific situation, and I have been becoming increasingly frustrated that I can't figure out exactly what to do and I can't summon up the effort to do anything. 

So, do any of you have any insight? At this point, I'll take basically anything.",mentalhealth

1697512496.0,My mental health is catching up to me at uni,"I started at a pretty well ranked university a month ago and it was quite a snap decision, I had gotten lower A-level results than what I'd needed for my first choice uni. Originally my plan had been to take a gap year and retake if I didnt get the grades I needed however they were much lower than I was expecting and decided that I'd struggle more if I had to retake all 3 subjects in a year without teachers. 

  
Now im 3 hours and a £60 train ticket away from home and 2 hours or more away from my close friends and I thought I was good at being independent through difficult times. Sixth form was not an easy time for me, I had a friendship group that did not treat me well at the beginning of year 12 that effected my confidence and my trust in people. I also lost my mother to an eating disorder and alcholism the day before I was meant to start year 13 and before that she'd been verbally abusive and dismissive of me. Despite this sixth form was ultimately a good experience I left with amazing friends and supportive teachers but I dont think I realised at the time they were what was helping me through all the mess around me and now I dont have them in my life in the same way. 

  
I've spent most of this month either in bed or out of the city im studying in, I've already been up to see my partner twice which is a 5 hour journey both ways as well as returning back home and visting friends in another city. Each time I've felt so much regret for where I chose to spend the next 3 years of my life and on top of that I feel regret for what I've chosen to study - at least in the way its taught at university.

  
I feel really lost as if I dont have a way forward or a way out, I dont trust myself to drop out and actually do something with my life there but I feel so trapped here. My accomodation at uni was also a shock in a lot of ways I now live with 16 other people in an old house on the edge of campus, its okay and I like my flatmates but its a lot of people, it makes me scared to leave my room even just to shower or go to the toilet, let alone eat or do my laundry so im using so much mental energy just to get basic tasks done which leaves me so low energy. I've also become semi nocturnal because of how bad my mental health has spiraled so I havent been attending lectures or really doing my studying either I just want to find something that makes me happy where I dont have to rely on other people to make me feel fulfilled. I want to feel confident and good at something again. ",mentalhealth

1697497857.0,Hey…I’m looking for a little closure and help.,"Ok. I have a lot of pain about my youth…like I’m always trying to make sense of who I am…I’ve always been the kind of guy who has a real soft spot for girls. 

But I don’t feel like I am going to be respected for that…cause I’m an adult. I also really enjoy fine art and creative design. I’m a beauty junky. Like I think about that a lot…but I was bullied, beaten as a kid in a different culture and I was visible minority.
I’m running on…but I lost a brother recently to drugs and he was being abused where he was at…so I dunno what I’m trying to say. I just can’t get the words out. Neway I respond to beauty intensely…it’s like a hit. 

But I feel like I’m going to be outcast for that…even my wife musundestands it a bit, it makes her insecure, or always thinks I’m trying to replace her….but I just need to be ok…

I want to respect myself but I feel like I’m going to be ostracized for this…loving beauty so much. 

I don’t condone having sex with every pretty thing but I really what I relly crave is being trusted around beauty. I feel like that is the last thing popular culture wants to endorse…a middle class 36 year old man and father to be trusted…and I understand why. People have really been disrespecting girls.

Anyway I don’t know if I’m going to be ok. I’m just saying that because that’s how I really feel. Like I’m not going to be ok…I suspect psychiatry of trying to neuter me with antipsychotics because I was too attracted to beautiful girls when I went back to college. Like I’m just not safe as i am and need to managed.

That’s bitter but how I feel about that. Neway if you read all that thanks. My brother died and he had a little girl so I think it’s important I be able to be a support or cope with not being trusted.",mentalhealth
1697511297.0,"having trouble with (abrupt) breakdowns, looking for advice","for some time now my mental health has been doing a bit rocky, but as of quite recently its sort of taken a crash landing with some mild exploding here and there. in general, for several months now i've definitely felt depressed featuring a lack of interest and lack of motivations in most things i either need to do or just about all the things i used to love to do. 

as of the last few weeks though my brain has started to almost feels like its a scale. one end feels chill and like my usual, the middle balance feels completely apathetic and almost cruelly detached from my thoughts and my feelings with a ""but its whatever, get over it, anyway"" attitude, and the other end is like irrational crying-so-hard-it-hurts-toddler-tantrum-where-you-decide-no-one-likes-you-and-you-should-runaway with a sidekick of incredibly unwanted intrusive thoughts (go figure). the latter comes in the form of hour or more long breakdowns, sometimes triggered by incredibly small things and sometimes seemingly nothing, and afterwards i either snap out of it like it wasn't a big deal (??) or end up feeling empty and numb for anywhere from an hour to the following day. 

when it comes to the apathetic portion, there isn't much to say other than it just feels empty and i just go about my day - sometimes however, its also accompanied by this really weird disconnect to things i have quite literally done or memories i have and whatnot. like my brain will sometimes think of past things and start to feel a certain type of sadness and/or nostalgia and i feel like it wasn't me who experienced it and its like i'm some dude looking at my brain going ""man, sorry that happened to you :/""

I can tell for sure though when my mood starts to flip to the other end of the scale because it kind of feels like suddenly i do not want to talk or do what i was doing etc and my thoughts kind of flip from ""ooh when i get out of work maybe i'll get a burger :O"" to ""i will never thrive and i am doomed to a cycle i've created"" - which i can tell you in my current mindset is absolutely not how i actually feel and i don't know where that even came from but in those moments it definitely feels like the realest thing in the world. as a whole i can summarize it with i think and feel a lot of things that i know aren't true and/or i don't agree with when i'm not having a sudden outburst, some of them things i think are really mean to think or things i think just literally make no sense and can even be hypocritical, but that logic doesn't work in my mind during those times. 

to be honest, i don't think this is really brand new by any means, but its never been this bad. initially i was going to try to wait for it to pass or something but its starting to escalate and the part of me that doesn't tantrum and feel like the universe has abandoned me or whatever is getting pretty sick of this behavior, i will not lie >:/

i was kind of wondering a few things - for one, broadly, do you have any advice for anyways to go about handling this type of abrupt brain hell? (as well as things to maybe ease in or out of the breakdowns or at least comfort and self-care style things to do during that time.

1697511093.0,I don't know what it is...,"I've been feeling strange lately. I just haven't felt like myself. I feel like I'm this character that I don't like. Everything just gets on my nerves. I don't like the way that I speak with people that I'm close with, and that doesn't mean I'm acting mean or something and that I wanna stop. That's not it. I obviously say nice things and whatnot but I just don't like my own tone or the way that I form my sentences. It's like I'm even annoying myself.

I don't know how to describe it. Perhaps it's been the stress from being 15 and having to deal with school, I'm not sure. I know that it's probably normal and it might pass eventually, I just don't know how to deal with it right now. I don't want to upset anyone like my girlfriend for example. I've talked to her about it and we couldn't figure it out. Maybe I'm self-conscious about my looks. Sometimes I wish I wasn't so tall or that my eyebrows weren't so thick or that my nose wasn't so huge, or that my hair would cooperate with me on how I want it to look. I enjoy many things like spending time with my gf and friends, playing video games, doing all sorts of crafty stuff, yk. I just feel like the way that people perceive me isn't the way I want to see myself. It's like I form my character based on how people look at me or speak to me. It's also been getting on my nerves how I've been having to explain what I mean to people, if that makes sense. Like for example, showing my gf a meme and she doesn't get it. At that point I just don't wanna explain it yk. I just wish people understood the person I wanna be and what I try to say instead of saying ""huh?"". I just kinda feel like a question mark. Is it identity crisis? Derealization? Just stress? I have no clue. Any help with what I'm experiencing would be greatly appreciated.",mentalhealth
1697496983.0,How can you tell if you actually need help or if you're just overreacting,"Idk if I need help or if I'm just a pathetic little bitch overreacting to normal human things. Idk. It feels like I shouldn't get help. Therapy is like a seat on a bus and I'm a young able bodied man and the people around me are elderly, children, or pregnant. Everyone I know has worse trauma than me, I don't even have any trauma so I can't have any sort of mental illness. I feel like I should be able to just snap out of it and be happy since anyone would be happy in my situation. How can I possibly complain when I've always had a safe home to go back to, food on the table, clothes on my back, and mommy and daddy are paying my way through college? How could I possibly deserve help when there's so much worse around me?

I want people to worry about me, I want someone to be concerned so I can feel like I deserve help, I want someone else to push me into it so I can feel it's justified. I'm so pathetic, I'm so awful, I can't even grow a pair and get over it. I have no trauma, I have no major pain in life, I'm just terrible. Do I deserve help? Do I deserve happiness? It feels like it's my responsibility to step back and let those in oppressed groups get help before me since they go through so much more pain. I'm a straight white cis woman. I have everything handed to me, I shouldn't need any help. I should be happy and it's pathetic I'm not. I should be happy and I'm just ungrateful. I'm truly terrible.

She’s also said some things recently that have worsened my thoughts, but I don’t want to hint that I’m doing worse than she already expects that I am. She’s honestly putting me down and I’m already at rock bottom.

But I don’t have any family and friends so I guess she’s my only support at the moment—which is fine. I’m just sensitive.

1697510199.0,I'm losing my mind over a bathroom.,"I’m new here on reddit. I actually just joined after having a breakdown in my room. Sorry that it's long, I kinda didn’t realize how much I was holding in.  
  
My brother and I live together with my mom. I’m 21 and he is 23, it’s not ideal to live with our mom but we both have nowhere to go. And it doesn’t help that we both are jobless, so we’re just munching off my mom. I’m currently enrolled in community college after dropping out of high school, so most of my days are just me going to school, studying, and coming back home. It’s been a repetitive cycle of me going to school and coming back. I have no friends, I’m socially awkward, basically I feel alone and like shit on a daily basis.  
  
There are three bathrooms in my mom’s house. One in my mom’s room, one in the hallway next to both me and my brother’s room, and one downstairs the guest bathroom. Though the guest bathroom doesn’t have a bath or shower, it’s a half bathroom. Me and my brother use to share the bathroom upstairs next to our bedrooms, but I moved myself to the downstairs bathroom because I’m so sick and tired of my brother’s disgusting habits.   
  
When we shared a bathroom, my brother would always forget to wipe the toilet seat after using it. No, I don’t mean pee, I mean dirt. My brother has a habit of not showering so when I use the bathroom after him there are dirt stains on the toilet seat that I have to wipe up in order to use the toilet. Whenever he or pick his hair, he would leave his hair on the bathroom floor. If he took a big dump and it smelled, instead of leaving the bathroom door open to air out the bathroom (there isn’t a window in the bathroom), he would leave the door shut and when I go to use the bathroom as soon as I open the door I’m hit with the smell of ass. My brother basically eats the toilet paper, and as you know because of corona the price of toilet paper has skyrocketed and since we’re free loading off my mom we only get a select amount of toilet paper for both of us to use.   
  
Whenever the bathroom gets a little too dirty, I do my best to clean up the bathroom. I don’t want to use a dirty bathroom. The thing is my brother contributes to none of the cleaning when it comes to the bathroom. Every other month I clean the bathroom because I want to use a clean bathroom, and like a week after I cleaned the bathroom my brother somehow has found a way to make It dirty again in less than a week. So, after being fed up I decided to stop cleaning the bathroom, thinking that when it gets too dirty for my brother to use, he would decide to clean up the bathroom for once instead of waiting for me to do it. But after a while the bathroom was getting so nasty, I just had to clean it up out of pure disgust. I just cannot use a nasty bathroom like that even though my brother had no problem using the damn thing.   
  
And I wish I could tell my brother to get his shit together but I’m too scared to talk back to my brother. I’m too scared to put up a fight, so I let him walk over me every time. It’s a long story that would make this long story even longer, but long story short, my brother would always hit me when we were younger. My brother has a shit temper, he will get upset at the simplest things and instead of using his word he uses his fist. You should see his room, the number of holes in the wall… anyway.    
  
After suffering in my room about this whole ordeal, I decided that I was going to start using the bathroom downstairs. So that we can have separate bathrooms and I won’t have to worry about my brother. And I had just recently cleaned the bathroom downstairs, so I was feeling good about the switch that I made. But even then, my brother would take the toilet paper that I was using because he ran out of his, even though I divide the toilet paper evenly between us. And recently, after I cleaned the downstairs bathroom, my brother has started to use the bathroom downstairs. Why? My guess is he doesn’t want to clean the bathroom upstairs. So now the problems I’ve been having in the upstairs bathroom, is happening in the downstairs bathroom.  
  
I’m losing my mind right now, crying almost every night about this damn bathroom. All I want is a clean bathroom and for my brother to clean after himself. I don’t know what to do now, I’m stressing over toilet paper.

1697510072.0,Why is it so hard for me to function like a normal member of society,"
I’ve been stuck in the same lazy, unmotivated pattern for as long as i can remember. I’m only 19 but i already feel so tired of life. For literally all my teenage years i’ve felt this constant burnout, like i’m physically not strong enough to make anything out of myself. I’m always tired, always stressed out, always upset and mad, and i can’t remember the last time i felt energetic and not sleepy. 

I had to quit high school and i’m still taking classes online to graduate, got in a special program for people who struggle mentally. It was hard to get up, do everyday tasks and take care of myself when i was in school. So overwhelming, could barely stay awake through the day because of it all. But now that I only stay home, and don’t really have any reason to get out of bed i find it physically impossible to. I can barely go to the toilet because of how tiring it is. Haven’t brushed my teeth in so long, and i feel so disgusting at all times that it makes me feel even more drained than i already am.

 I’m too ashamed to admit i’m struggling and my family has always been so emotionally distant and busy with their lives. I’ve already been a burden for so long, been bullied for years and in and out of therapy. The only support in my life right now is my mother but.. me and her aren’t exactly that close anymore. It’s complicated. Even though i live at home i barely speak with her, she seems tired of me everytime we talk and it makes me feel ashamed that i’m still living at home. Like she wants me to move out or something. I don’t really think she likes me.

 Idk where i’m going with this, but i just feel so hopeless. I feel like this is a neverending cycle and i eat so much crappy food that i actually feel my health declining lol. How do i get my energy back. I’m almost wondering if I have some underlying condition because of how exhausted i constantly am. Every little thing tips me over the edge and i handle small changes and stress so badly. Have to take several days to recover if anything out of the ordinary happens.

 I feel so far behind all of my former friends and the people in my life, and I have no interest in anything. Feels like i’m stuck but at the same time not really living anymore. Feels like everytime i wake up its a dream, because of how much i sleep. Confusing dreams with reality is a daily occurence now because of how much i sleep. What can i do?

I ended up doing to a residential treatment facility but I know that type of long-term care is different from what I was asking my psychiatrist.

1697496165.0,I feel like everything that brings me joy in life will inevitably be ruined.,"You know the concept of ""enshittification"" that Cory Doctorow talked about with websites and other services like that? It feels like that's happening all the time with everything - especially the things that bring me joy in the world. 

I'm a writer and I want to make a career out of it, but I don't know how when every possible publication is either on the verge of shutting down or about to turn into a meaningless content mill. I could be a professor somewhere, but I'll have to be an adjunct for years if I even get that far, because the entire world has been turned into a gig economy. The movie industry is in as precarious a place as it's ever been, especially movie theaters, which are one of my favorite places in the world. The internet has been shrunk to five sites that regurgitate content from one to the other. Everything's run by private equity firms that do nothing but suck the joy out f the world. AI could make things even worse, to say nothing of climate change. And I have no idea how any of this can be fixed.

I'm not in the mindset to sh right now, but I can imagine myself coming to that in the distant future. I have a girlfriend who I adore, but I don't want her to deal with all this shit, either.

1697509197.0,Do you think I should switch therapist?,"Hi, I hope you’re all doing great. Let me start by saying I’ve been seeing a psychologist since february this year and we’d been doing ERP and in yesterday’s session she refused to do ERP because she said we needed to do what’s called “Cognitive Restructuring”. However, she figured it out I tend to blame other people for my actions/and or for the things that happen to me instead of taking responsibility for it myself. She said I needed to change some negative thinking patterns and that there were many factors both internal and external that contributed and triggered my OCD, such as certain beliefs among other factors.

On the one hand, it was frustrating to hear that for now we are going to pause ERP, as I feel it’s essential. On the other hand, she also said the only thing ERP is going to do is desensitize me and that I needed some cognitive restructuring in order for it to be more effective. She said that if I really wanted to do ERP, she could refer me to another therapist, but for now we had to do some cognitive restructuring first before we continue with ERP.

I really need your advice, I don’t know what to do.

Do you think I should switch therapist?

I think that by any means ERP should be paused and tbh I don’t want to waste more time. I’m 31 years old and I just want to overcome OCD as soon/fast as possible.

In fact, I’ve been struggling with OCD myself since my teen years and it ruined my twenties. Nowadays OCD is between mild and moderate according to her.

What should I do guys, I really need your advice.

1697495640.0,"I think I might be loosing my sanity, have a psychosis or mania or possibly all at once","Theres a laundry list of diagnoses I have had most of my life. Cptsd, dissociative disorder, autism, adhd and multiple phobias and general anxiety. Often enough I wonder if I might have bipolar disorder as well but I’ve never spoken to a medical professional about that so far. 

I have no idea how long a psychosis can last and I truly can’t differentiate what might be signs of a psychosis and what might just be symptoms of my other disorders. 

My brain just constantly feels muddy and I can feel myself slipping. Slipping with the extremity of my emotions, slipping with my touch to reality, slipping with my general thought patterns. 

I can’t really remember a time that I didn’t have this sense of slipping though, probably had it for 8-10 years now. A lot of it is probably also due to my dissociative disorder, there’s times where I can’t see or speak properly, times where I can’t walk properly, times where I loose all sensation in my body, times where I can’t hear properly. Ever since I was young I’ve always had a haunting sensation of someone being in my house that has lasted to this day, ever since I was little I also kept seeing shadows of a figure or a silhouette always just barely outside of my field of vision. I have phases with extreme happiness, irrational spending habits or extreme depression. 

Every single day the past 5+ years or so I have desired to harm myself. It’s the only thing that gives me peace of mind and the only thing that makes me focused enough to be productive. Over the past years I have developed less destructive, harmful and more sustainable ways to do that. Not because I really care for sustainability but because I really don’t want to deal with questions from family members or people surrounding me. 

I am completely out of touch with reality, everything just feels like I’m in some sort of dream state. 

I’ve been in therapy for years and it never did anything. After a year long break I’m now back at looking for a therapist and psychiatrist since I want to try out if there’s possibly some improvement when therapy is supported by medication. 

I was on schizophrenia meds before when I spent half a year in a mental hospital but I truly never felt like they did anything apart from making me feel drowsy.",mentalhealth

1697508888.0,What causes someone to feel like they can't be loved/liked if they make a mistake?," Most of the time when I make a mistake it causes me to feel unlovable/unlikeable for a while (which in the moment feels like it's gonna be for the rest of my life lol). Like for example, if my mom gets upset at me for something I did I always end up feeling like she'll never love me again or that I can't/shouldn't be loved because I'm some sort of terrible person or not good enough and it throws me in a loop for at least a night. If I get one bad grade (that isn't even that bad) on an assignment in school after getting multiple high grades in a row I'll feel like the teacher lost all faith in me and then be embarrassed to pass anything in after that and/or start slacking off. If I notice a friend talks to someone differently than they do with me, the second I'm alone my mind will immediately go ""do they even actually like me?"" ""do I have it all wrong?"" ""do they feel like I'm forcing them to talk to me?"" and other questions along those lines. I constantly question if I'm actually good enough for my friends and the people around me or if they secretly make fun of me behind my back. I also don't believe I could be loved in a romantic way at all. I just don't see how something like that could be possible for me, not for any particular emotional reason either. I have a lot of love to give but I feel like I'm just incapable of receiving it for like no reason. Not built for it ig. I literally cannot fathom that idea without feeling paranoid. I know that if someone did, I'd be waiting for them to give up on me and leave for whatever reason they have. I don't feel like any connection I have with anyone can be something permanent and that I'll just end up hurt in the long run.

&#x200B;

When I was a kid, every single one of my best friends (and I didn't have a lot of friends because I was shy) would move away.  My dad also was emotionally absent while semi-physically absent. Eventually he left and became comepletely absent. My mother is extremely avoidant when it comes to emotions or conflict or anything that can be slightly percieved as a problem, and usually just resorts to saying ""whatever"", ""nevermind"", being in denial, walking away, avoiding accountability depending on what it is, going and taking a nap/going to bed, or telling me to fuck off. She isn't the best at communicating. I still love her even when I feel like she doesn't love me, and I understand we're all just products of our environment. Once I became a teen, around 12-15 I was friends with people who were extremely toxic because at the time I was easily manipulated and an EXTREME people pleaser, while also being toxic myself. I ended up cutting them off (it was really rough, for a while I kept going back lol) Also at 13, I had a friend who decided to start really intense arguments out of nowhere, try to push me away, and also had me thinking they were going to kts for a good couple of months and made me pull multiple all-nighters. The stress was so intense that I got physically sick at one point. They would never hang out with me or talk to me in school but then I'd see them go and hang out with their friends. Sometimes they'd cancel on me to make plans with other people. Finally let them go after a while, but I was really in the dark with what happened so I thought about them a lot. Two years later they texted me one day and we became friends again. Lo and behold it goes to shit and I cut them off because they were a horrible friend once again. I did that a few months ago. There's only one friend that I've been able to keep but even then she has moved since. She's still my best friend though and we talk a lot every day over the phone. Growing up, I was extremely shy, and early into my teens it was full blown anxiety. I'm getting over that now.

&#x200B;

Those are the only things I can think of, along with other things I will not type but Idk wtf is wrong with me dude. I constantly feel like everything is on the line all of the time, that all my relationships with everyone are more fragile than everyone elses, and I feel like my brain is hiding so much stuff that could explain the way I feel. These feelings affect every single aspect of my day no matter how big or small. I don't believe I have childhood trauma but my family is ... dysfunctional to say the least.

What are some examples of things that could cause someone to start thinking of themself this way and feel this way?

&#x200B;

I'd also like to note that I don't take these feelings out on other people as it is not their fault. I have no problem with people setting boundaries with me and vice versa. I also have no qualms about leaving people who are not good for me, though it does take a while as I can convince myself that I'm the problem and at fault for every single thing pretty easily still.

1697508041.0,Emotionally abusive/manipulative ex reached out a year after break up,"So I broke up with my boyfriend around a year ago. It was the best decision I made but it took me way too long to do it. I don't think I even wanted to date him at all, but I caught feelings somewhere (I slept with him and I was a virgin) and just got along with it ignoring all red flags. Eventually I just couraged myself up and stood firm on my decision. We separated. We dated for almost 1.5 years. 

The last time he tried to reach out was late may or early june, so 5+ months ago. Before that he reacted out almost every month. I ignored all of that but this one. I decided to reply this time and he kept thanking me for that, telling me stuff like 'i dreamt of you 3 times this night' 'you can always count on me' and told me he wants nothing from me but 'message me at times and ask how I am' and asked how my family is doing. It was clearly his attempt at slowly getting me back by getting me to talk to him first. So I said that nah, don't msg me again I only replied out of politeness and to tell you you just should move on. Then I blocked him.

But part of me keeps wondering, why did he reach out at all? Call me a skeptic but I don't believe he 'loves me'. Yeah I know he suffered, and clearly suffers now, but I feel like it's not because of me, it's because of him. *He* lost a free emotional support, a free sex on demand, a free maid and a cook, a girl 10 years younger who looked 14-15 like he preferred, a good girlfriend who put up with his shit and never demanded anything in return, not even cheap gifts or even basic respect, and with all that, a tall slim 8/10 virgin, god damn not all men are lucky like that, even attractive, wealthy and good men, let alone trash like him. I feel like he only messaged me because he could not get anyone else, esp someone like me. I'm pretty sure if a 13 year old looking 18 year old girl will agree to date his 32 hear old ass he will very quickly forget I existed.

'i still love you' my ass. Translation: I can't find another fool like you and I want to fuck/I'm lonely. Please believe my sweet words again and come back to me and help me get rid of my loneliness. I'm old and I need a son asap but no one wants to birth me kids because I live in a trash 1 room trailer park.

But another part of me is solaced/pleased/happy he didn't forget me. I feel better knowing he realizes he valued me. He was an a$hole but it would be much worse if he just used me and never even cared I was not there anymore. I still think of him often but it's mostly anger and regret I gave him a chance. And yeah, I do miss him a bit at times, some sweet moments hence why I care to type it all :) yes I'm happy he messaged, and not even as a 'gotcha' petty moment, no... More like, I gave all myself and got trashed up in return but it could be worse and he could just never remember me at all. Kinda like that. 

I'm glad I didn't let me even as much as casually talk to me. I did what I should have done in the beginning - rejected him.",mentalhealth

1697506597.0,Lost and venting,"This might be a long one so I’m not sure how many people are going to read this. I’m going to put it into a few different subs and my punctuation might be a little spotty so I apologise for that. I’m a 21 (almost 22) year old male and I live in the UK. Im not really sure what I’m looking for posting this on Reddit, I’m not looking for someone to have a magic solution to all my life’s problems, I was going to write  all this into a journal or something but I’ve scoured my house for a pen and I can’t find one.

I’ve suffered with anxiety my entire life as long as I can remember, I was always an anxious child, mainly health anxiety. Over the last 10 or so years I’ve convinced myself that I have almost every sinister disease and ailment that exists at some point. From heart attacks, brain tumours, testicular cancer (and basically every other cancer) to even small marks on my skin that I’ll see and convince myself I’ve been bitten by a deadly spider or something. I can’t remember how or why but at some point my health anxiety developed into agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations that are hard to escape if you were to have a panic attack or an anxious episode of some sorts (I think).  I first noticed this when I was 15 doing my GCSE mock exams, we would do our exams in a big sports hall with small tables dotted around it, this never usually bothered but one occasion I had a panic attack during an exam. I asked my exam invigilator if I could leave to go to the toilet and I was told no. My panic attacks were always quite subtle if you didn’t know I was having one, I wouldn’t be hyperventilating or passing out like you see in films rather I’d be sat there with thoughts racing through my mind, my hands getting clammy, my vision becoming blurry, my senses suddenly becoming more pronounced (especially my hearing) & getting the feeling I was in a dream, that my hands or feet weren’t mine & that I was watching myself in 3rd person. I’ve since learned this is called derealisation and it’s a response to extreme panic.  

After this I started experiencing these panic attacks and episodes of derealisation more frequently in school. It got to the point where one day I went home and told my parents that I was never going back to school again & I didn’t. I left school in 2017 , a year before I was supposed to leave . I went through home schooling for my final year,  completed my exams at community centre & left school with 3 GCSEs. Initially I was relieved, it was great not having to go to school and face my anxieties and sleeping in until whatever time I pleased, I answered to nobody lol.

Flash forward 6 years and Im still at home, sleeping in till whatever time I please & answering to nobody only this time it’s not so great. I was kicked out of college, I’ve been fired from or left 4 jobs & not even turned up to interviews for another 10 or so. Im 21, unemployed with no prospects or qualifications, I’m losing friends constantly, I’m an alcoholic and I never leave my house because If I go further than 20 minutes away I have a panic attack. My friends are outgrowing me and dropping like flies, my family are getting increasingly frustrated with me although my parents are incredibly supportive and understanding. Just this year a friend who has always been by my side stopped talking to me after I flaked on a plan we made to go on a hike on the mountain (which is one of my panic attack triggers) & despite my efforts to reach out and sort things I’ve been ignored for going on 7 months now. Every day for me is the same, sometimes I get a jolt of motivation where I plan to start MMA and get a job and get my life in order but I suffer so much with social anxiety and low confidence  that I end up flaking on those too, I can’t go on holidays or to festivals with my friends because I’m scared to fly and I’m scared of motorways, the only things I really look forward to is whatever UFC event is on that weekend. I’m a fairly good looking lad and I’ve always had attention off girls but I can’t get a girlfriend because although I have a licence I’m scared to drive my car & I have no money to take them anywhere and have any kind of normal relationship with them so it always ends up being a 3 month thing until they get bored of me & I always end up with my heartbroken drinking more and more to get rid of the pain. I’ve had private counselling which I didn’t feel like was helping me at all because the lady doing it wasn’t understanding what I was telling her, I’ve been on multiple SSRIS (currently 100mg sertraline) and I’ve felt no relief from any of them, in fact I’ve become more depressed on them. It’s something  i hate to say but I feel like if I didn’t have anxiety around my health and I wasn’t scared of death that I’d have killed my self a long time ago. Just so lost and I don’t know where to start. Sometimes I just want someone or something to come along and give me a glimmer of hope but nothing seems to go my way,  life just seems to keep kicking me down. The other day a girl I fancy randomly liked a few old pictures of me & I felt great so I messaged her and after a short one sided conversation she left me on read. I felt like this was the universe taunting me. Anyway that’s my venting done",mentalhealth

I just want to look nice, act nice, and feel nice. But I can't.

I wish I didn't get so depressed whenever something bad happens to me, but I can't help it. And I feel like the only people I care about so much in this world will never love me as much as I love them. I try to do everything for my friends, to make them happy, to help them, but I don't know, I feel like I get a bare minimum in return. Which I don't mind so much, it's something, its attention! Honestly, that's probably me being selfish, me asking too much of them, and I hate it. I'm also aroace, cupioromantic specifically, and I hate not being able to feel romantic feelings. I daydream so much about being in love, and someone being in love with me. But every relationship I try something just goes wrong. I hate it.

1697505975.0,how can i know if i'm being gaslighted by my family or if i'm genuinely overreacting?,"first let's be honest and recognize that people often exaggerate their feelings and overreact to stuff, so please don't come to me saying ""your feelings are always valid"". no, we should be able to question when our feelings are genuinely bigger than the situation, and it's healthy to identify that in order to heal and grow.

with that being said, i don't know if my family is gaslighting me or if i'm just exaggerating everything that's happening. they make me feel miserable constantly. idk if i was emotionally abused or not as a child because idk if it was really that deep or not. although i think it's deeply affected me in my adulthood. 

i've tried to talk to them about this, the things they've done and how they make me feel but they always shut me down or tell me i'm just playing the victim. one of my relatives then started to apologize to me after i had a suicide attempt and said they were so sorry for everything they had done and how much harm they cause me but it felt ingenuine and manipulative. 

i'm constantly asking myself if maybe my feelings about my family are just an overreaction of mine, given specially that they've failed to recognize them. 

i also feel like i'm constantly walking over eggshells in fear i might say something wrong and they misinterpret it and an argument gets started.

And the last example that happened to me approximately 2 months ago was that I was with 2 of my closest friends drinking beer and it was late and I had to leave, and I asked them if I would buy one more round of beers to which they said yes, but No one took their beer and they kept it for themselves, I only took it. In the end I got angry because I felt that they made fun of me by not drinking their beers and being the only one who drank it, and I argued with them telling them that and also on several occasions that I was the one who had the initiative to get together and in the end they left me standing . This is causing discomfort to my girlfriend because he sees that I think that people do things and make fun of me.

I’m getting slightly concerned because I keep having these weird mood changes. I don’t think it’s a hormonal issue as I have been like this since childhood. What happens is that even the slightest thing may cause me to just flip, whether it’s from a really depressed period to a manically happy one, or from a completely calm one to an angry one where I can’t control what I do. I’m usually really hyperactive in general, and my thoughts are usually a jumbled and fast mess, but my mood can literally turn on a pin and it’s making me feel guilty to how I’m making people feel.

I hate it and it gets on my nerves that I will honestly try my hardest to not flip like this regardless of what mood it is, but I keep consistently being unable to. I feel uncomfortable with talking to doctors (I did before and just felt really overwhelmed) and it doesn’t really work for me.

1697503639.0,Do I have depression?,"First, I know it's not healthy to ask this on Reddit. The best course is to go to a professional and seek help or talk to a close friend. But I'll give you two contexts below so you would understand why I have to say it here.

Context 1: From where I'm from, mental health issues are easily dismissed by people as ""just acting out, being too emotional, etc."" And while we're slowly breaking the stigma here, some of my family and friends still subscribe to that old narrative and would even tell me to ""just pray."" 

Context 2: Aside from people who dismiss me, those who do understand have a lot on their plate right now and I don't want to burden them. Even my girlfriend is busy and stressed with work, though she listens to me when we have the chance to talk.

**So here we go...**

I was laid off from work last mid-July. It came out of the blue. I didn't expect it because even if I was a freelancer, I usually have this gut feeling whenever the project is going south. Most of the time, when I feel like things are slowing down, I look for other projects to fill that gap. This one I didn't see coming.

As a freelancer, I always communicate with my clients, especially with my performance and what I need to improve. It's like my quarterly review/check because even if the editors don't have any problem with my writing, I still want to know if there's any way I can improve. I was doing a great job with my work, my editors loved my work ethics, and I got perfect ratings during performance reviews.

I also asked our Managing Editor about the status of the company whenever we got in touch just to gauge how long the project would still go on. Two weeks before I got laid off, she said everything was going well.

So when they sent the email that they had to let me and other writers go, I was in shock. I wasn't prepared for it. It was only a week's notice, but that's fair since I was only a freelancer. (Mind you, I have had previous projects that the client just deserted out of the blue.)

Between then and now, I only had two projects which were really cut short. I don't think it's about my work. I think it's about cutting the cost, especially when they have a VA who knows how to use ChatGPT and other AI tools.

I kept applying for jobs on most job boards I knew. I usually don't want to commit to a full-time job since I want to open myself to more projects and possibilities, but I reached desperation and applied to a full-time job, even those that would mean I need to migrate. 

It's been 3 months since I had no work, and it's already making me more anxious than I used to. My savings are running low. Jobs aren't easy to come by. Bills are piling up. My mental health is declining by the day.

It comes and goes. There are days that I feel nervous whenever I can't find a job to apply to in a day. I get anxious at every email I receive, only to feel down when I see a rejection. I stare blankly at anything for most hours of the day. I cry often, and there's this heavy feeling in my chest.

I know you can't and are not allowed to diagnose me, but I just need a push in the right direction. And even if I am depressed, I don't think I can afford professional help with my financial state right now.",mentalhealth

I am currently diagnosed schizophrenia, I'm medicated, on therapy, and everything else for more than five years now. I have had the same psychiatrist for a while, but every single therapist in my country denies diagnosis of any sort. A friend of mine was told she didn't have depression despite showing obvious signs. I lost her to suicide. She was never diagnosed, never went to therapy. It's horrible.

Now, I was telling my psychiatrist how I thought I may have ADHD to some point. It's driving me crazy, and it's been present since I was a child. It's recently taken a toll on me because of university, I cannot for the life of me focus during class. I have no idea what the teacher is talking about 90% of the time. I try to turn off my phone but I need to constantly take breaks and get out of class to breathe because I cannot stay focused. Studying at home drives me crazy, I always end up studying things 3 hours before my exams which, as a bio major, is \*not\* a good idea. You can imagine what some of my grades are.

I recently had a talk with a friend over this, because she complained I didn't do any work (I do, I just do it right before the deadline which drives her crazy and she ends up doing it herself) and there are things she just won't trust me with anymore so she hands over the work with my name on it despite me not doing anything. I seriously whole-heartedly believe she thinks I'm stupid. Honestly I believe I'm stupid as well. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I'm about to drop out of uni, I love my career but I'm just not fit for it. I don't know what else to do in life.

I talked about this with my psychiatrist and she said it was ""normal"" and to just ""try to focus more"" which is nuts to me because I swear I do what I can. I don't even care about medication anymore, I just need to know if I'm going too crazy over this and I'm just stupid or if something is actually wrong. What the hell.

I am extremely busy, working two jobs and going to school full time. I know I have a lot on my plate so i need to be easy on myself. The only thing I’d really want to change about my life right now is making a friend or two and having more fun. I am not really interested in dating because the thought of it sounds to exhausting right now, and while a relationship theoretically sounds nice, I would have the time or energy to be a good girlfriend or partner at this stage of my life. 

But that honestly is what is bothering me. I know people who are just as busy if not more than I am, and they somehow seem to have energy to want to go out and do things all the time. I only have one full day off and if I don’t spend that day resting and cleaning my home, the rest of the week is absolute chaos and exhaustion. For example, this weekend I drove a couple hours to see my brother and see Adam Sandler perform. I had such a good time. But I had to drive home that night so I didnt get home till about 2 and then had to be up at 7:30 for work, and I felt like I was dying the next day. I still dont feel back to normal two days later. It makes me not want to do anything fun because its not worth being so exhausted after. I also get stressed about not being a good sister or granddaughter because I just don’t have time or energy to visit them all the time. I am either working, going to school, studying, doing chores or sneaking in an episode of a tv show every now and again. If I dont stay on top of any of those things, i get really stressed.

1697501892.0,Ups and downs with my mental health,"!!! Content-Note: Suicidal Ideations, self-harm, unhealthy relationships, abuse. !!!

For the record: I’ve been struggling with my mental health for a long time now (started in 7th grade or sth) . Some months more, some less. In the last few months I’ve really dabbled with the thought of having BPD/EUPD aka emotional instability disorder. 
Whoever is familiar with this disorder or has any form of knowledge for this topic, please leave your thoughts below, thank you :)
In the following text I’ll only list things that I think are relevant for this disorder: 

-chaotic childhood: my dad was working around 80% of the time in my childhood/youth and my mom was home. We fought a lot bc I was a pathetic liar. We had many fights. I experienced emotional and sometimes physical abuse. 

-unstable relationships: got into “romantic” relationships in 6th grade already. It wasn’t romantic, it was pure chaos instead, we fought a lot for 12 year olds (in most cases because of her eating disorder). Had several friendships which never lasted longer than 2 years. My last intense friendship ended with both of us threatening to report each other to the authorities for several reasons. Our friendship was the best and worst I’ve ever had. But the friendship itself was a rolercoaster. He threatened to kll himself several times, so did I. He was abusing drugs so much. He was fucked up. We weren’t good for each other. 

Self-image: idk what to say ab this lol

Unstable emotions/impulsivity/anger: my boyfriend says that I am the most unpredictable persons he knows. I recognize my emotions being mixed up pretty often and sometimes pretty heavily. I try my best not to show the anger I am feeling sometimes. But my emotions are immersive if I don’t beam myself out (idk how to say it better)

suicidality/self-harm: been admitted to a closed psych ward bc I was suicidal after my friendship almost ended (the person mentioned earlier). I abused alc several times to “regulate” myself. 
In certain situations if I get really angry at myself for example I self-harm. I think about suicide at least once a week if I’d have a to give a number. 


Fear of abandonment: I don’t think I have to say anything to this anymore haha. I do absurd and unethical stuff to not get left.  


Feeling detached from reality: it happens way too often. I don’t remember certain months of this year. I’m just so spaced out sometimes. After one fight with my boyfriend I was so out of this world I went outside (~2 degrees Celsius) and I didn’t feel it.  I felt my body shivering but mentally I just wasn’t there. 


I can give more details if needed. Even in German bc it’s my mother tongue.

1697501208.0,My fiance is unemployed and depressed,"My (34F) fiance (37m) is currently unemployed and has been for about 6months.  We have applied for unemployment benefits and they have been exhausted.

He has been very depressed and frequently tells me that he wants to give up and that he's tired of life.  He hasn't made any suicide attempts or harmed himself, but I work from home so I make sure he's in the room with me whenever he's awake.  Based on what I see and my own experience, I just don't think he needs to be hospitalized for how he feels at this time.

He was a very hard worker, responsible, and generally happier when he was employed, and I know he has it in him to get back to being himself again.

I try to encourage him by letting him know that he's loved by me and his family.  I compliment him about something every day (ie he's handsome, he's muscular, strong, manly, etc).  He still works around the apartment, like cleaning or fixing something simple or fixing something with my car whenever I ask him to, and I always praise and thank him whenever he gets something done.

I look out for any kind of job that I know he'd do well, but whenever I show it to him or encourage him to apply to it, he gets very agitated and angry.  He'll also get depressed when I tell him that we don't have enough money for something (either bills or food) or whenever I talk about how we're struggling financially.  He also stays up till morning and will sleep until 3 or 4pm.  (He says it's because that's when his friends are online to play).

I'm becoming even more concerned now because he's lost the motivation to apply for more jobs, and I suspect he hasn't applied to anything within the last couple weeks.  I brought this up to him and he got angry.

To compound the issue, he refuses to go to therapy or a psychiatrist.  I have suggested it many times and he will get angry every time.

At this point it seems that he gets angry whenever I push him to do anything unless it's to fix or clean something.
I would like to make it clear that I am not leaving him.  He has made big sacrifices to be with me.  He loves his family very much, but he still moved to a state 20 hours away to help me take care of my parents who are ill.  He's also sold some of his very valuable belongings to help us stay afloat (gaming laptop, tablet, etc).

I also have no intention of getting him to stop playing games online.  They're the only friends he has and it's the only time I get to hear him laugh or see him smile.  It's the only thing he enjoys now.  Playing online is also how we first met, which I'm very proud of, despite how others might think.

I am hoping to get some advice on ways to keep his spirits up and getting him motivated to apply for jobs again.  He's always been a bit grumpy and moody, but he's a sweet and kind person who is in tune with how I feel, and he absolutely deserves to be happy and loved.
Thank you!",mentalhealth
1697501130.0,Phobia of drugs and alcohol consumes my thoughts daily and I feel powerless to stop it,"I'm a 26 year old male with autism/asperger's, clinical depression and anxiety (treating with zoloft.) I've had a multitude of mental issues and false thoughts that thankfully I've been able to work through and change my thinking with therapy. But there's been an ongoing thought pattern that I've been struggling with for years now and I'm starting to fear will never get better.

I've traced it back to my middle school and high school years and the health classes I took with my peers at the time. When those classes would do units on alcohol and illegal drugs, they would understandably have a negative perspective- not a hardline ""Just say no""/D.A.R.E. approach but firmly opposing any drug use including marijuana, and irresponsible drinking. I took the warnings of negative health effects and addiction so seriously that at that time, I promised to myself I would never even try alcohol, weed, etc. even once. I felt content with this until I was 17/18 and my fellow seniors were becoming more openly vocal around me about experimenting with booze and weed, while I was in SADD and helping promote drug and alcohol abstinence- and it completely broke me. How could my peers have sat through the same classes as me and made the choice *not* to heed those warnings? Especially the Honors students I had classes with and felt the most kinship with- even they were becoming open to it? It would have been one thing if I was opposed to just irresponsible use- but I was so dismayed I became completely philosophically opposed to *any* amount of alcohol consumption or usage of non-pharmaceutical drugs including weed.

I felt so confused, frustrated, stupid, and alone, and it's only become worse as I've gotten older and my eyes have become fully open to how common drinking is in American culture and elsewhere, and recreational marijuana use becomes more and more publicly and politically acceptable. I've tried everything to dispel my fear and the thoughts I kmow are illogical. Therapy, thought exercises, I even broke my vow and began (occasionally) drinking over thw past few months in the hope that facing my fear would dispel it. But I just cannot get out of the rut no matter what. My thoughts race nightly with anxiety and anger at the legality and commonality of alcohol and now marijuana. Fantasizing and wishing that society would lose all interest in intoxicating substances, embrace sober thinking and good health, and make marijuana and alcohol illegal- and only making myself more depressed because I know this fantasy will never happen. Having to keep all these thoughts bottled up because I want to be a progressive, liberal, open minded person and don't want to be ostracized for my fear of alcohol and weed and drugs. Judging people for using them, knowing I'm being too judgemental, and hating myself for it. I just want it all to stop and not occupy my thoughts every single late night and early morning and just treat these substances like a normal fucking person.

I apologize for the word vomit, I just need to get that all off my chest/out of my head. People of /r/mentalhealth, can you offer me any advice on how to conquer this phobia and this negative thought spiral? Thank you in advance.",mentalhealth

I feel like I’ve achieved all their is to achieve in my life. And I’m fed up of just doing everything alone and ok my own.

I really struggle to articulate my childhood as on paper, it wasn’t astonishingly bad. We had food, clothes, went on holidays, got given gifts on Xmas. However, my mum and step dad suffer with alcoholism. So there was a lot of alcohol, violence, verbal abuse and drug taking in the house. 

Anyway, I’m not far from 30 (28 1/2), I’ve never had a partner and at this stage I’ve just come to accept that I will reach my 30th birthday having never had one. Which is probably the most embarrassing thing I can think of…

I’ve done school, university, first grad job. Done some travelling, but I think that’s there is nothing left to achieve now. I don’t think I’ll ever have kids or get married as I’m just not good enough for anyone. There’s still places I would like to travel to, but I just don’t know if I can go in yet another solo holiday. (Friends all have partners etc so no time for me)

I hardly speak to any of my family, we’re not estranged they just don’t care about me…

1697478125.0,There might be a very good reason behind my ongoing depression,"Hi folks, i was just thinking that my ongoing depression doesn't seem to be improving very much despite cbt therapy and antidepressant. 
I believe that the reason is we don't live in a world atm where we have a lot of reasons to be happy. 
Those in work being kept on the level by the daily grind, but overall the state we find ourselves in, is quite depressing,  and we haven't even talked about the everyday problems on top of that. Or the old traumas and unresolved personal issues.
Looking at this, im not surprised at all that mental health services appear to be overwhelmed and a lot of people who are self aware and can have access to their emotions are feeling low and unmotivated. There isn't much to look forward to when it comes to the future of humanity. I do hope that we will improve,  but im losing hope of a better future.

1697499014.0,How do you deal with uncertainty in friendships?,"TL;DR: How do you know your friends want to spend time with you if they don’t usually initiate interaction.

This is more so regarding those closer friendships that you have a higher emotional investment in. For instance, I have friends where I’m currently at that I enjoy seeing and occasionally spend time with, but I don’t go to them with personal issues and I’m not exactly looking for ways to spend time with them most of the time (mostly because of lack of common interests and stage of life). However, for those closer friends that you specifically want to spend time with and grow those relationships, how do you tell if they want to spend time with you? In my case, I have a couple friends that I know love me to bits, but they’re usually too busy to do much other than call maybe twice a month, but I have some other friends elsewhere that I know enjoy having me around when I go to visit, but I don’t really get to talk to them and I usually can’t get them online to play games. I’d like to spend more time with them, but if I approach it directly, even if they agree, that doesn’t answer of the question of if they actually want to grow that friendship (or if they’re just doing something because you asked), but if I do nothing, I’m just sitting here with almost no human interaction besides work. Not entirely sure what to do in this scenario. Thoughts?",mentalhealth

MRI tech never had me read the med guide stating trace amounts of the metal retains pretty much indefinitely. They told me it’s water-soluble and all gone in 24 hours. I found out about retention after and went down the gadolinium rabbit-hole, reading all the horror stories and bad experiences people had. Found a FB group of people suffering from toxicity and other anecdotal reports that did not help. I also saw that Chuck Norris wife apparently suffered from horrible heavy metal toxicity from it, which scared me even more. 

I essentially had a mental breakdown that landed me in the psych ward for a week. I can’t cope with knowing that I have it in my brain and body forever, even if nothing happens. I’m physically fine (so far) and I don’t want medical advice but I just cannot mentally come to terms with this. I feel completely unsafe in my own body now and have been dissociating so much.

1697496194.0,"Struggling with a lot of things , but I’m too scared to reach out and ask for help.","This is a throwaway, cause I believe my ex browses Reddit sometimes

I [21M] have been struggling recently with a lot of things in my life recently , to make a long story short , in 2020 I was dating a girl for a year and a half , abruptly in May of 2020, she cheated on me and left me one of her coworkers for a short fling. This drained me mentally , while also going into my first year of University , and losing out on my senior prom and graduation. I never had a support structure to reach out on during this time , so I struggled to keep it all inside and just faked a smile to everyone I knew, my friends , family , and even more recent partners . But deep down I knew that I wasn’t mentally sound or okay, but I’m still scared of truly opening up to anyone. 

Skip ahead to the end of 2021, and I started to truly feel better in a mental sense , and I met a girl(ex) [19f]. I had never truly felt happier then when I spent time with her, but at the same time I was hesitant to truly let myself open up and spend quality time with her. I had lied to my parents to go out , and would sneak out and meet her  and that’s how we would spend time together , for the first couple months this was the main way we hung out , and I admit it wasn’t the best or smartest way to go about meeting someone. 

But after a couple more months , I had made a mistake and forgot to delete a dating app, which was shown in a screenshot of my homescreen while we were looking at my camera roll, this spun a huge argument and accusations of cheating , which I tried and tried to state that I had not done anything , but it was not ending well for me one way or another.

This was my fault and I wholeheartedly acknowledge that it was a mistake and that I deserve any punishment that I had gotten. But after a week of time apart to think about the relationship, we needed up giving it another try, but this time with limitations and things , like location sharing apps, passwords, etc. At this point , I really tried to make things better , in terms of the commitment and openness because i believed this was my last chance to make things right.

Going into the fall season, things started to look good for the relationship , my parents and family met her, I met her family and we hung out constantly. I was finally in a better place mentally and I gave my love and appreciation constantly. But towards the beginning of November this became distant overnight. Suddenly she was going out with friends on late night drives multiple times a week, there would be less phone calls and late night FaceTimes.  It got to the point where we didn’t even spend time together on thanksgiving. 

Towards the beginning of December , things got to a point where there just wasn’t a relationship anymore and so I brought it up. And at the end of the day it was a difficult decision for both of us that we shouldn’t continue. 

I tried to clear my mind and mentally reset , as I was in a better place from where I had been a couple years prior. So I had downloaded a dating app again to get my confidence back up , and I saw her. She was one of the first people that popped up, so I quickly blocked her on the app so she wouldn’t see me on it, then promptly deleted my account and deleted the app. This was the moment my mental health shattered.

For the first couple months of the year, we had texted once or twice a month, sometimes non at all, till at one point she had asked me to hangout and just catch up, so I accepted and we spent the afternoon just talking over dinner and seeing how eachother have been. Before leaving we talked about the breakup and how everything ended and she asked in a normal tone
 “Do you remember M from when we met? Well he started texting me again in October.”

For context, M was a friend of my ex’s that played the good guy role, and he stalked my social media, and constantly told my ex that I was a bad person, and that he was the one for her because he was really nice. So we talked about it before things got really serious and I told her I wasn’t comfortable with her talking to him anymore , and so she agreed and blocked him on everything , and at this point he blew a fuse and tried to meet her at her work, and kept on claiming that he would treat her right and that I wasn’t good enough.

So hearing that this guy was texting her again before we broke up, it started blowing up my anxieties again. I started thinking about the times where her location had randomly turned off, and the excuse was that the app had glitched, and my mental health took a dive.

At the time, I didn’t think much of it, and we talked for about more frequently. Then abruptly she ghosted me for a couple weeks, after two weeks of nothing I asked if there was any point in me trying, and she said that we should just move on.

For the month following that , I had looked at her social media and had seen that she had updated her profile pictures to some where it was her and M. And now all I feel is dread inside.

She seems happily in a relationship with someone who made me uncomfortable, and I keep hurting myself by looking at the pictures. 

How can I move on? How can I find peace knowing that I may have been cheated on ? It’s been months and I’m still in a rut, what can I do to save my own mental health?

TLDR: Past relationship issues caused problems early on in new relationship , solved issues then started overthinking when past issues came up in new relationship, now I’m stuck and drowning mentally and have no one to reach out too for help. What can I do?",mentalhealth

1697494989.0,TW: talk about suicide. One of my best friends keeps hinting at committing and i don’t know what to do.,"I have no idea if this is allowed here or if I need to put a trigger warning, but I’m honestly so lost right now and don’t know what to do so this is my best bet. I’m also using a throwaway account. 

So I’m 14 years old and I have an online best friend who’s 12, almost 13 who we’ll call K.
Me and K have known each other for about 3 or 4 years now and speak via instagram. About a year ago now K opened up to me about his mental health and trauma. Absolutely terrible stuff that I won’t get into here. I was the first person he ever told and I can see why, as when he finally DID tell his parents they dismissed everything. I honestly felt sick to my stomach when I heard that they just acted like what happened to him was ok. He’s also asked for a therapist but they refuse to give him one. He’s told the school counselor and they’ve done nothing. 

So fast forward to now. 
One thing you need to know about K is he communicates through the music he listens to, which is difficult for me as i don’t listen to most of the stuff he does. He usually puts songs up in his notes on instagram. (in case you don’t know notes is a feature on ig where if two people follow each other, in DMs you can see these little messages they type out. You can add music and people can reply to them and whatnot)
And here is where I introduce my other friend, J. I’ve known her for as long as i have K. We’re a trio. 
Now I never see K’s notes on ig. They never pop up for me. But J does. 
J will tell me if K puts something worrysome in his notes. 
But I usually can tell when something’s off with K because he types funny when he’s not in a good mood or tired or even feeling suicidal. He’ll say “lol” instead of laughing how we usually laugh in text. 
A few days ago K had done just that and I asked “what’s wrong?” He said “idek” i pushed to get more out of him and he just said he was having a good day until he got home and it was probably just depression. 
Then J shoots me a dm saying K had told her he was thinking about committing. 
I of course freaked out. But I didn’t say anything to K about it. 
Since then K has been putting stuff in his notes about looking up how to tie a noose, saying “what the f**k is wrong with me?” Along with the song “don’t try suicide” by queen. 
Me and J have been talking about mailing K some gifts to cheer him up but we haven’t got around to it yet. 
But today, things have gotten worse. In just a span of 2 hours I’ve had to ask him if he’s ok twice because he keeps saying things that are setting off alarms in my head and he keeps avoiding the question. 
First he put a song titled “i deserve to bleed” in his notes. I’ve never heard the whole song but I recall portions of it from online. I asked him if he’s ok he said “it’s homework. Totally.” I asked him if he needs to talk and said if he does need to I’m here. I always tell him I’m here if he needs to talk. He said “no :3”
Then he sent me a video of someone talking about jokingly looking up how to tie a noose on their school laptop. And he said “ima do it”
I may just be crazy but that set off alarms. I responded with “i don’t know if I should be worried or not.” He said “>X3”

I’m honestly so worried. I don’t know what I can do to help him because we live hours away. 
I know this is kind of shitty and selfish of me to bring up, but this is also affecting me and my own mental health deeply. I’ve been depressed recently and for a while I was having my own messed up thoughts due to a broken ankle. But I’m in a slightly better space now thanks to not being in agonizing physical pain 24/7
But I just can’t fill from an empty cup. I’m trying my best to do everything i can to help him but I’m out of ideas. And I can’t even help myself on top of that. 

I’m just worried and upset. Is there something i can do to help him? I know I can get a welfare check done on him if I think he’s gonna actually commit, but I don’t know what to do. I’m just out of ideas and energy.",mentalhealth
1697494868.0,A guy is obsessed with me and it gives me intense anxiety,"I'm a current high school student. My ""ex"" (if you would even count it as a relationship — it lasted 1 month 2 years ago) won't stop trying to text and talk to me. Last year, I told him to leave me alone about 5 times, and I thought he finally did when he stopped texting me for a few months. But a few days ago he sent me about 50 audio messages apologizing for everything he did wrong in our relationship and asked if we could be friends again. I thought he sounded sincere, so I accepted his apology but said no to being friends. But now he texts my friend every single day asking her for advice on how to get close to me again, even after I explicitly said no. My friend tells him every single day that  he's being delusional, but he won't give up and says things like ""if I keep trying, she'll see she wants to be close to me again"" and ""I know I can change her mind"". I hate him; I think he's obnoxious and annoying and egotistical and disgusting.

I could block him, but I live at school and have to see him every single day regardless. He also knows some potentially life-ruining stuff about me that I was dumb enough to tell him at 15, so I'm scared to be too direct with him in case he tries to use it against me. I have extreme GAD and social anxiety and think about killing myself every day because of this. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal at all, but this combined with college apps and social problems makes every second seem impossible. My mental health has never been so low.  ",mentalhealth

1697492438.0,The UK is fucked! ZERO EDUCATION ON MENTAL HEALTH,"We are taught about how to look after our bodies as soon as we walk through our first classroom door, but we are taught very little or nothing about our mental health?  
I'll quote The Matrix, ""The body cannot live without the mind"" You can eat all the veg you want, do as many press ups as you want or drink as much water as you want, but if you don't look after the thing that runs it all...none of that will matter.  


It is agreed by the majority of the scientific community, that the thing that sits on top of our shoulders contains the most complicated thing in the universe! So why do we go into our adult years not knowing anywhere near what we should know about it? Suicide rates are climbing, mental illness is climbing and so is the pressure on the medical world to sort it out! 

Just 12 hours ago I was told that one of my work colleagues at another site killed himself last night! We are dropping like flies and help is getting further away for people that desperately need it. The NHS funds things like surgeries for people who want to change genders or to not have a gender at all, but if you want an assessment for something like ADHD you have to wait 4 years now in the UK. The world has gone mad! The ironic thing is that if we put more money into Mental Health funding then people wanting to be genderless wouldn't exist. It's clearly a symptom of bad mental health! These people don't feel like they belong because they haven't been given the right parenting, left in front of a tv, tablet or phone to listen to others that are in the same position and haven't been educated about their own minds.  


We fund wars and natural disasters in other countries and fund accommodation for people coming here illegally, but we can't fund our health care system and save the lives of the people that run the country. During lockdown the government put homeless people up in hotels and then stripped them away after the pandemic ended...unbelievable! I also don't want to hear about covid having an impact on the NHS and our economy and cost of living crisis blah blah blah! Energy companies and big pharma have come out of a pandemic in MASSIVE PROFIT! I won't explain that, but look into why!  


This country is failing, rapidly and I won't be here to watch it completely collapse. People think voting for Labour will help HA! If you believe a change in jumped up posh wankers will change this country for the better then you are wrong. They are there to entertain you, keep you thinking you have a little say whilst they take home a big pay day and buy more land and houses.  


My advice to anyone that is struggling is this! Do your own research and take your life into your own hands because it is possible and you are strong!  
I've overcome Anxiety Disorder, Depression and ADHD by reading, learning about what they do and making time to deal with them. I have 4 sessions of CBT lasting 20 minutes each, I did the rest of the work. Your mental health works the same way as your physical health. The more effort you put in the more you'll get out of it. You do 100 push ups for 100 days you will see the improvements, but you need to put the time in to do them. Same thing with your mind. If you spend time each day listening to your thoughts, googling questions you have and learning about what you're dealing with then you have a better chance. Seek out therapy, seek out books that will educate you and seek out people you can trust! Help isn't coming from the government and probably not the NHS soon enough.   


Lastly, there was a lot of times before where I didn't think I'd make it, believe me I've been in that medicine cupboard, I've held the knife and I've stood on the edge of that bridge! I'm still here. You can do it, you are more capable than you think. If we weren't capable then I would not be here!

maybe ill fix it one day ngl in my head i wanted to post it somewhere to 
  
see if anyone can recognise how I feel
  

  
18 yo man from the uk I turned 18 this august
  

  

  
every now and then I get this feeling of unstoppable pressure that comes back every now and then , I get this feeling of unstoppable pressure that grows its infinite no matter if I weep laugh or moan its there watching like a shadow .
  
Every time I think I'm getting better it seems to come back and feel like a new presence every time , and although it may feel like a new presence its undoubtedly the same thing there is no other feeling that could mimic the pain that
  
i endure every time this comes around. Something that could easily be mistakeable for a physical injury based around the heart it's able to control my whole well being . When i see it in my head i see it as a place that im in and im 
  
stuck here i cant move all my thoughts now have to pass through some sort of barrier that makes me see everything is a different sort of way , im unable to focus on certain tasks and i get a jelly feeling in my stomach its almost as if
  
i feel guilt and anxiety together , I could possibly be feeling other things that im much less familiar with or i haven't been able to associate it to a something that i already know of . i do know that this feeling which hits the hardest
  
while im alone in my own thoughts follows me everywhere and eats at me , even though its silenced when im talking to a friend or doing something where i have some sort of attention on me something where i feel acknowledged and seen its 
  
always lurking in dount and hesitation it travels through every thought i have like a spike of lightning to remind me its there .
  

  
Anxiety to me is different when directed at different things . its about who i am and who i feel like i am .it links heavily to the fact i never feel safe to act like who i really am and im always on guard of messing up like being ""weird""
  
""loud"" ""annoying"" ""freak"" having convocations to me feels like something i need to do right and i know it shouldn't feel like that . every time i act like myself in front of someone  for instance if i slip up with the constant act that i 
  
put up with or i feel comfortable enough to be myself they start to treat me differently like the respect no matter how big it may have been even if any vanishes and the persona that i put of for that amount of time slips and i lose then ik
  
that person doesn't actually like me even with people like my friends i get it i feel the need to be this person whos funny loud annoying or whatever that group of people perceives me as and i do want to stop and i have often in the past 
  
the just brush it off as me being weird im not able to do things like how i see other people do so like talking to ur best friend and having normal idle chatter or something or updating me or small talk i cant do the casual i always jump
  
to the extream. and when i look at m friends for an outlet to let this out i cant find a single person i hate telling people how u feel on the inside because no matter what you do they're gonna look at you different they wont see u as the
  
same person they saw before that and i hate that because i dont think thats me . also i look around and i think these people dont actually care , yeah u can say ur my friend or whatever u can say that you're there for me but whatever
  
talk is cheap and when it comes down to it no matter what i tell u you're reply with the standard ""its fine"" ""i hope ur ok"" ""how does that make u feel "" thats not what i want or need to hear and its not ur fault its really really not
  
your fault because i dont know what i want to hear or what i should tell other people  i feel so guilty why am i telling you all my business is what i think honestly sometimes i think if i tell someone all of this id prefer it to be 
  
someone i dont even know i dont know why someone ill never see again someone i dont need to talk to which is sudo what im doing here on my notes app i dont know what im going to do with this will i send it to someone or is that a 	
  
bitchy cry for help . idk idk skip that bit i dont know what i need to hear is all im saying but i think inside of me i do know but i wont let myself know i know i cant tell you but deep in my mind ik i know and surface me doesnt even 
  
know what that is. i tried to do this before and i wrote something that i believe to be wrong i said i think i wanted someone who would feel bad for me thats not true i dont want that at all but i was in my own head then and thats what 
  
i though i needed. i have never said or put any of this stuff out before these are usually thoughts that are in my head and now i can visually see them i feel a bit better idk why but the feelings are still there. When i'm out and about
  
i put on a persona i lie a lot i think i might just be a chronical liar and i dont like that fact im just so embarassed of myself and being judged that i hide everything about me all the nerdy details and all i act like im this
  
guy who does these cool things that i may not even do or have only done once or twice its not just that fact that i feel the need to be liked like others i feel the need to stand out and be accepted i wanna be cool i want to be there
  
for other people  but i don't want to comfort other people i hate that because i don't know how to do it its really really shallow but i want to be seen as cool and i want to be accepted by everyone when im in my persona i do things
  
like make fun of ppl to m friends or something like furries pussies (reffered to as like bitches or ppl who dont smoke or something ) or something for example just going w them getting rly nasty even if i have no negative emotions to the other person at all over the last 3 years i have stopped or at least tried
  
to stop for the most part making fun of people to their faces because i actually feel really bad like a piece of shit but something in my head contradicts my previous statement of not feeling bad for myself because i seem to do it a lot
  
i think ive found a sort of comfort in it like if i do something bad i could just say well this that and the other or i wont even acknowledge it in my head as something negative ill give myself positive mental what's the word its like
  
encouragement um starts with an r oh re enforcement ill act like i did something good because the "" cool "" people around me fed into my social mind where i seek social validation.
  

  

  

  

  
honestly I don't think there is a single person in this world who sees the world like i do so i wrote this as if I was explaining it to a normal person and if there is something here that u find idk similar or like u are
  
able to recognise that feeling or emotion I doubt its the same and that's not a pity party i just dont rly know how to explain how i feel without linking it to certain things i tried my best to make this sound as close to my perception of
  
truth as possible
  

  
i didn't rly go into my anxiety and other feelings to other things in my life because i got side tracked but if this is received well and helps me i will continue to share some of my personal mental health diary
  

  
so someone please tell me something i actually don't know what im wanting to hear but let me know",mentalhealth
1697492169.0,"its so hard for me to "" survive ""","TW mentions of eating disorder, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, grief (?)


im a 16 years old transgender male, im depressed and  ive been going on a circle of searching for attention online by older men and women. i started doing this when i was 15 and continued till now. I can't blame them for using me because in the end its my fault for letting them talk to me and stuff, anyway everytimes it makes me even more stressed and depressed than before, and weirded out especially because many of these people seem to like the idea that i self-harm and ive been asked to do it (which i did since that its already commin for me to cut) and also starve, maybe connected to the fact that i have an ED.
the only thing that basically kept me going in life was talking to these people and my eating disorder. 
I know it sounds weird, i know its not moral, and I'm really ashamed of all of this, but tslking to them makes me feel special and wanted, appreciated, its like a drug, i always come back to it. 

reacting food and controlling my weight/calorie intake was also what kept me going: being overly obssesed over these made me forget all the bad things. I fee like the thing i want the most in my life right now is to be underweight (and i am almost but i still see a fat fuck when i look in the mirror lol.), also especially because my brain is convinced I'll look masculine if i get skinny and I'll like my body more, yeah gender dysphoria sucks. 

anyway in these days i feel particularly bad, i cry for no reason and i feel more mad and ashamed about myself, ive started to crave more alcohol (thank god i dont look a day over 16 so usually i cant buy it and have to ask others). 
it seems that im thinking more about my mom, which also passed eight months ago, which is still very very unreal and weird for me. It doesnt feel real. 

honestly ive been having trouble with making impulsive decisions, i feel like im getting more more obsessed over these unhealthy methods, and i feel like an irresponsible fuck these days. sometimes when i make bad decisions i really just stop and think if it was really me making them, its weird.  
i feel very alone and worse, i feel bad just for existing and the most terrible thing is the shame i have ahainst my gender identity amd my sexuality, ive attempted some times over these two but never actually really really tried to die. Im scared (or maybe relieved?) that one of these days ill just get really drunk and do it. 

sometimes i like to imagine what would happen if i survived, i like to imagine all the people worrying for me, and finally seeing my pain, and helping me. yes its very selfish and self-centred but its the only way i think i would feel appreciated. I dont feel good about myself i always doubt everything i do, im a people pleaser and would do anything to be liked.

1697491819.0,Can't find a meaning,"Hi there,

&#x200B;

So I am currently in bi-weekly therapy and the last few sessions we have started discussing what I want from life.  So far all I have is ""I want my family to be happy"".

I can't even think of something else, and my family being happy isn't a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic & Timed) ambition, so I sometimes dont think I'm doing it when I am and vice versa, which has lead to the ambition losing some meaning.

I just don't know what else there is?

I have a skilled job, which I love and don't want a promotion to management so I don't have a career ambition.  My wife has 2 amazing kids which are now getting ready to leave the house and she doesn't want any more and I don't want any of my own.  I basically sit on my PC for 10 hours a day, be it video games or streaming services, I have nothing else (well, except Warhammer, but I'm just not in the mood).  DIY I can only do at weekends as my wife works from home, I clean up a bit but thats a chore.  I just don't know what to do with myself, so have come looking for advice as I am completely stuck.

Anyway, yesterday I left my apartment for a run and noticed a pigeon sitting outside on the window sill. It seemed uninjured at first though I was unsure on what to do, so I picked it up and put it outside. I live on the too floor of a 5 story apartment block. It didn't really occur to me that it shouldn't have been so easy to pick this bird up, and it did fly at me shortly before picking it up, but as soon as I left it outside the reason was obvious. I'm not sure what was wrong, but the pigeon was having trouble moving, and frequently fell over onto it's face. I left it some water in the hope it was just dehydrated and to give it time to recouperate. 

I came back from my run and the pigeon had not moved from it's spot, it was also been blown around by the wind. So I discussed the situation with my partner and decided to move inside into a box. This was around an hour or two later. 

I came downstairs to find that the pigeon had passed away, in the exact spot I last saw it. I know this happens all the time but I just can't get past how sad I feel for this poor bird, and how frightened it must have been in its last moments.

1697487350.0,"Is it normal to be upset, because my friend moved away with his girlfriend that our friendgroup dislikes?","Me and my friend group finally met the girl our friend was dating. We were so happy to hear that he's finally moving on after his abusive wife. We are super accepting of people and want to make them feel like they are welcome and loved. We are extremely goofy and love enjoying each others company. We love everyone's girlfriends and boyfriends, but we don't like her. 

When we first met her we just thought she was too shy to talk to us, but the more we hung out the more uncomfortable we got. The vibe was off and she never said a word to any of his friends (our friend group) she just wanted his tongue down her throat or to go back to his place and have sex. He told us their love was mostly physical. I've known him for 12 years and I know they have nothing in common and my girlfriend has said the same thing. They were constantly on each other and she kept wanting to kiss him all the time, he couldn't even talk to us normally like he always would. 

We kept our mouth shut since we were happy for him and that he's finally happy with someone and I didn't know if I was just iffy about their relationship, because of how his ex wife was to him or if my feelings were real. But then two of our friends came forward saying a lot more stuff they see that I didn't (I didn't like her so I didn't want to hung out that much) and we talked more and became worried for him.

and now after a month of being together he moved into another state 12h away with her parents (they know each other for 2 months) He didn't even say a goodbye to us, he literally packed his bags without any thinking or even got a job before actually making such a huge decision.

I'm really sad because we were the most closest from our group and we did everything together, she tried but immediately said she likes nothing of what we did together :(

He also stated that he's eager to move out of the shithole he was living in, but if he moved for this reason then he is settling for the bare minimum...

Questions:
Is it normal for me to feel upset? 
Have you ever felt like someone is no good but couldn't pin point what it is?

should I have said anything to him?

1697473096.0,Attachment Disorder?,"The only thing worse than being whiny is being whiny, apologetic and overly verbose — so I’ll just cut to the chase. 

I’m a 21 year old guy, I think I’m not a good person (nothing dramatic, I’m *nice* but superficially so), and I have little interest in trying to be something different. Still, I can already see this way of being having grim long-term results. 

I don’t have close or truly sincere connections, the friends I do have I’m barely invested in and let go of too easily, I have trouble expressing frustration or being vulnerable with others, I back down from conflicts almost immediately, I get little enjoyment from physical or emotional intimacy (so far the only reliable way of entertaining myself I’ve found is learning languages, which is good enough). 

My only attempt at a relationship ended in two months with no drama or hard feelings — I cut contact upon finding out that he was actually really morally compromised. 

Since then, I tend to keep company of well-read men with whom I can do the whole witty back-and-forth banter thing, but I’m growing bored of this. 

I’m not seriously considering therapy at this point, and I’m not sure if I’m just in my head and pathologizing something ordinary for gay guys like myself who are a little quirky but otherwise normal and functioning. 

I may just be young and a little cruel as young people often are, or maybe there’s something I’m missing. Penny for your thoughts? I’d appreciate a second opinion.",mentalhealth

1697485976.0,Is this procrastination or something else?,"I am 25(F) and I often struggle to make decisions. I have never had a clear idea of what I wanted to do in life and always just seem to let life happen to me. I have been unhappy for some time now regarding my career and all my wasted potential. I did well in school but had no idea what to pick in college so I ended up doing something my parents told me to do (I know, that old tired tale).
I could’ve accepted my fate and enjoyed college while trying to genuinely be good at what I was majoring but looking back at my time I was always complaining and waiting for the 4 years to end. It’s been 4 years since I graduated and while I worked jobs directly related to my degree I wasn’t satisfied. I knew I was not making extraordinary strides in my career like my friends and I wasn’t particularly fond of what I was doing. So in 2022 I decided to go abroad to get my masters degree in order to sort of pivot my career in a different direction. Picking something to study was hard because now I had to choose between specialising in my field or pick a completely new one (like getting an MBA or business related MSc). While I thought I made a good pick I was constantly unhappy with it and was always on the look out for a better course with no solid plan for the future. When the time came to actually apply for my visa to go I got cold feet and deferred my programme to the next year at the very last minute. I felt helpless, had so much anxiety and didn’t know what to do. I started therapy but it wasn’t really helping. I applied again this year and the same thing happened. I missed my deadline while I knew I was running out of time. But i could not physically bring myself to do it. A million thoughts racing in my head like ‘what if you hate it there, what if you stay unemployed, what if the course is not what you expected’ so many irrational fears.

Something happens that makes me put off making decisions even when i know I have no time. It’s like my perception of time is completely fucked and I think i have more time than there actually is. I was also taking medication for anxiety and I felt like i was in a stress free bubble when i was actually supposed to utilize my last shot at this and apply for a visa. I don’t know what i am doing but I don’t know how to stop this cycle of self sabotage. My parents are at their wits end and while they have told me to get my act together it goes over my head for some reason.

1697485441.0,Looking for advice,"I just need advice on my situation. So I've been feeling depressed, and I can't focus on anything. My brain feels so foggy. I feel drained from nothing. I missed so much school because I kept getting panic attacks at the thought of going to school. I get really depressed because I feel like I am a failure for missing school. I always either can't sleep for days or sleep for 10–12 hours a day. I have exams again in a few days, and I can feel the days pass by without me studying. Another reason I keep missing school is that when I go to school, I feel everyone judging me. The lights at school make me anxious, and the loud noises, I am scared to ask my parents for help or to get me a psychiatrist or a therapist because my dad doesn't believe in mental illnesses, and my mom will tell me some religious reason why I'm feeling this way, plus my 3 siblings got to go to a psychiatrist because they were on the brink of suicide, and I feel like my mom will tell me either money is tight or that I'm copying my siblings, so I don't talk about it.

1697485346.0,I just got a prescription for ADHD and I feel like a moron. I need perspective.,"I know that my experience is probably identical to a lot of the people who post here so I'll keep it brief and cut out the details.

\- I've always struggled to focus on menial tasks

\- Simple homework assignments like reading logs would drive me nearly to tears when I was young despite being so damn easy.

\- Sitting down to work on stuff has always been agonizing. The only reason I did well in school is that I was a good bullshitter and a great test taker. Everything I did was procrastinated and half-assed.

\- Even simple chores are a struggle when they really shouldn't be. I cannot do anything without multitasking, the boredom is torturous.

\- Being a half-assed procrastinator is not cutting it in the adult world

\- My life is being ruined by my impulsivity and lack of discipline. Even when the stakes are high, I can't focus on tasks. Sitting down to do 2 hours of work is really 30 minutes of work and an hour and a half of satisfying meaningless impulses.

&#x200B;

That's the rundown of how my poor attention span has affected me minus a lot of minor details. I finally bit the bullet and thought to myself that I might have ADHD. It makes sense given my behavior symptoms and at times my severe lack of focus. I spoke to a psychiatric nurse (because getting an appointment with a psychiatrist takes forever) and after speaking about my experiences and problems with her she prescribed me Wellbutrin. But I cannot help but feel like I'm just looking for excuses for the fact that I am just a lazy, undisciplined slacker that cannot be bothered to try. I believe ADHD is real and pharmacological intervention is a valid and credible treatment for it. But I have yet to pick up my subscription from the pharmacy and I'm really second-guessing even taking it.

&#x200B;

Based on what I've read, coming off of Wellbutrin can be a painful process that induces mood-swings and takes a while to ween off of. So if I find out it doesn't work well for me I'm committed to a neurological struggle for several weeks. And through this concern I've found myself just scared of the prospect of taking medication for my attention at all. I don't want medical advice about Wellbutrin, I can do the research on the drug myself (even if I get distracted doing it). I'm just struggling work through what might be a toxic attitude I have toward medicating myself for anything. I cannot shake this powerful, dreadful shame that I'm just making excuses and running to drugs to solve my problems when my attention problems may just be a product of my weakness of character. Some lack of willpower. Logically I know that I probably do have ADHD but whenever I think about treating my issues like a medical one I cannot do anything to escape this overwhelming shame keeping me from doing anything about it. Part of me feels stupid for even posting this. I'm not sure if I'm making any sense at all, maybe this comes off as an incoherent rant but I would like for some people with experience dealing with ADHD to help give me some perspective here.

1697485204.0,Do you think being suicidal can be traumatizing?,"I’ve gotten a lot better, but there are some moments when I have lingering triggers and discomfort around subjects of suicide. While I’m able to work through the things that led me to that point, my old mindset still feels so haunting and foreboding sometimes. 

Being suicidal was such an experience. It was so disorienting and confusing and it made me feel embarrassed, guilty, and shameful. And when I got better, it made me better at talking others down because I Understood it in a way other people who hadn’t experienced it did. Reading or seeing characters who struggle with it hits harder because I was there and I can remember it and it still hurts and feels awful. 

We had a discussion on what we would do if we found someones suicide note before they committed and when the other kids started talking I could feel myself just getting more and more disturbed because it felt so Wrong. All could think was “They would have killed me” be they didn’t get the desperation and shame and hurt and fear of someone finding out and being cruel and the teacher didn’t get it either and told them those were good responses. 

I’m open about my mental health struggles. I even opened up about my own experiences talking myself and other people down because I believe it’s important to help me get over that horrible sense of embarrassment. But I felt like I was choking when they were talking about who to tell or going behind the person’s back to get them help because I sometimes forget not everyone has gone through suicidal thoughts. If someone shined a spotlight on the trembling, embarrassing darkness that existed in my head and in my heart for a little over a year, I would have probably snapped. I was alone in that dim space I called my mind because I didn’t trust anyone to be as kind to me as I needed them to be and it feels horrible to know that in some way I was right.

1697483785.0,I think I'm developing some sort of social anxiety,"Hey. Recently i've noticed that i've gotten more and more anxious when going outside and encountering people (strangers). I first noticed it when going grocery shopping, because i found myself worrying a lot more than normal about other people in the store and what they might think of me. Furthermore even really small things like walking down my street to go to the doctor only to pick a description up have been a lot more stressful. Although the worst was definitely my appointment at the hair dresser, because i was literally shaking, getting stomach problems and feeling incredibly uncomfortable the morning before. The thing is that I was never too much of a social person, but I never really had many problems with those rather small tasks since they dont really include a lot of interaction with people. The only thing that stressed me quite a bit were big amounts of people when walking through bigger cities for example. These recent developments are kind of worrying me and ive definitely noticed the impact it's starting to have on me but I also have no idea why this has been happening.

1697481758.0,Behavioral Modifications,"I was diagnosed as bipolar in my early 30s and have been trying to improve myself both prior to said diagnosis as well as after the fact. I went to therapy for a few years, have taken (and still am taking) medication. I was taking Sertraline, Lithium, and Risperidone, but am now only taking Sertraline because I determined that the latter two medications were completely ruining my sex drive/life in general. I stopped taking both Lithium and Risperidone months ago and haven't noticed any substantial differences in behavior aside from being able to enjoy sex again. 

Recently I have tried to do more things without my health provider to improve myself. I am listening to positive-sounding music as much as possible to lift my spirits. I am watching videos on YouTube that promote positive/grateful thinking. I am slowly but surely starting to become more positive about my life as a whole, but am still having trouble with a few aspects. 

I have struggled with my weight and overeating for almost my entire life and have recently started fasting from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. six days a week with Saturday being my cheat day. I cancelled my 24 Hour Fitness membership last week after six years of going because I am no longer content with using their facilities due to the men's locker room being frequented by men who don't cover up after leaving the shower/while changing. Their showers and toilets border on being rancid all the time, which is also extremely off-putting, though not as bad as the constant nudity. And their saunas are almost always broken. That and I grew weary of having to wait for 10-15 minutes to use a machine/do a workout. So now I have decided to start using my HOA's gym. It's smaller and only has a few machines, but it will serve the purpose. I have also modified my diet to the best of my ability, though that will always be a work in progress. 

I also have a severe sex addiction which has led to some absolutely idiotic decisions on my part over the course of the last decade, namely sleeping with very loose women and burning through cash. I am trying to gradually wean myself off of this behavior as well because I know that the risk of contracting STDs and going through my savings will always loom large. I also watch porn often, a behavior I know is a direct result of my old man watching porn in front of me when I was younger. It's not healthy and I know that I need to either quit doing so or at least reduce how much I watch it. That and I follow a massive list of models on both Facebook and Instagram and have raised my standards to very unrealistic levels as to who I will date. 

My overall attitude still needs work. I have always been a highly opinionated/combative person, which, combined with my occasional explosive anger, caused most of my past relationships to end. I know that this is also a result of my father's abusive behavior towards my mother, my brother, and myself, and am trying to work on it. I am turning 40 on December 1st and want to become a better person. I've made my fair share of mistakes and have a very long list of regrets. But I don't want my legacy to be that of the world's greatest pariah simply because I didn't set forth the effort necessary to fix myself. 

Now that the above rant is complete, what does everyone else do to improve their behavior/attitude? ",mentalhealth

I know it’s weird but since then , for exemple if i was playing with him in his room , she would come , yell at me and ask me what were we doing , and i would tell her that we were just playing or talking but she wouldn’t believe me.She would pull me by my hair tell me that im a disgusting daughter that I will go to hell,  punish me and even hit me sometimes, all of this because she thinks that I have a relationship with my brother (It’s too disgusting for me to write it but I think you understand what type of things and relationship she thinks it is ).
 And from 7 to now (high school ) she still do it , im not allowed to stay at home when my brother is here , she would wake me up at 7 am if she had an appointment bcs she mentally just can’t leave me with him.
She also think I do it with my male cousins so when we are at a family reunion im like the only cousins who stay with the adults bcs am not allowed to go with them .

1697475731.0,I don’t understand what the feelings I am experiencing are,"I dont understand a lot of the feelings I feel and the things I do because of them. I’m pretty sure I have something like depression, anxiety, or ADHD. Ive had history of self harm as well as a dysfunctional family to give some context. Even before I realized the things going on in my house, as a child I always felt different from everyone else. As a kid I was basically mute if it wasnt my parents or siblings talking to me. I never spoke a single word at school and to others until I was like in 7th grade. Ive always had a feeling of anxiety since I was very young. I still remember instances when I was 4 or younger experiencing anxiety and racing thoughts. Growing up I rarely had friends due to this behavior but I also didn’t mind it. To this day I prefer to only have one close person in my life. Any time someone comes up to me to talk to me I immediately feel drained, as if all my social battery has instantly run out. I also find it anxiety inducing when someone comes up to me because I have to think hard and figure out what to say to them and how to continue a convo. I prefer to not have friends or be very social due to these feelings. Im more comfortable when people dont approach me. What exactly is this feeling? Or what could I possibly have that makes me feel this way? Also I was a very angry kid with very erratic outbursts that I feel are not normal for the average kid. For example apparently my mom tells me i’ve always been mean to my dad and hated him since i was still crawling. I also zoned out a lot very intensely to the point where when I came back to earth there were teachers surrounding me and waving their hands in my face. I went to a psychologist recently and he tested me for ADHD, and said I most likely have it based on the results, but I stopped seeing a psychologist before i could get a confirmation. Mental illnesses like depression also run in my family. There are also times where i feel like i’ve had a panic attack, but I don’t fully understand what they are and the things that i felt mean. Recently I felt this pain in my chest like the one you get when you’re in emotional pain and it wouldn’t go away. I then began to laugh and tear up at the same time. It then developed into me laughing and crying uncontrollably at the same time.

1697474751.0,I Hate Toxic Positivity,"I (24f) have ADHD, Bi Polar, and PTSD. I started having severe behavioral problems at 11 and was immediately put in counseling and on medication. My family believed in the “power of words / prayer” so they would constantly “speak over me” that I’m “healed” and I no longer have any mental illnesses. They would gaslight me into believing that I was crazier than I thought and that I was imagining things. Calling me extremely hurtful things as their teenage daughter who just needed love and acceptance.

Anytime I would talk about how I feel, I was always told “go to God” “try harder” “just stop being sad.” One of the therapies I did instructed me to list all the things I’m thankful for whenever I was sad. My brain doesn’t work like that, it didn’t help me, and caused me to be ashamed of my emotions and bully myself pretty severely, even self harming. 

Then I got sent away to a treatment center at 15 years old for a total of 14 months between 3 different centers. Besides the fact that just being there was traumatizing, they didn’t teach me anything new or helpful. I would constantly ask people “how?” How do I stop being sad, how do I control my emotions, how do I get my brain to be quiet? I thought I was so broken because I couldn’t “just stop.” I even tried to kill myself 2x before I was 18. 

After finding a good medication mix and a therapist who actually has the same diagnosis as me, I finally learned how. I’m doing much better, but I want to say fuck everyone who encouraged that I should read a certain book and I’ll be cured and that all of my issues were from a lack of willpower or just in my head. I’ll never be cured and I couldn’t get better until I accepted that my mental illness isn’t going to go away and I need to find a way to live with it.

Anyway, hope everyone is doing well and for anyone who needs to hear it: no you’re not overreacting, everything you feel is real and valid.",mentalhealth

1697474146.0,Getting GP support without the need for phonecalls [U.K],"Hi there

My friend is currently dealing with quite severe symptoms of anxiety, depression and also symptoms of BPD. They've never been able to get support and part of that reason is they're deathly afraid of phone calls. I can personally understand this as a few years ago I was in a similar boat, the idea of a phone call with a stranger filled me with dread.

Is there any way we can get the ball rolling with her speaking to her GP and start working towards a diagnosis without the need for her taking phonecalls?

It's not that I didn't try, it was just a really unfortunate accident, but it sent me straight over the edge. First, I was thinking about how could I already have broken this phone when I haven't had it for a day, which quickly turned into me looking back on all of my fuck ups in my life. Soon, I was asking myself what it is that is wrong with my head that causes me to be such a fuck up. By the end, you could find me hysterically and uncontrollably laughing with tears running down my face, wishing I could've died in some accident a long time ago. Then I went and lifted my weights and composed myself, and I'm right back to normal. This all happened over the course of about 10-15 minutes.

1697472462.0,It's all coming back and I need help,"Sorry for this being a long post, I cant really talk to anyone about the details, so I'm just pouring them out here. The ""asking for help"" thing is mostly at the end. 

After almost 2 years of total social isolation and individual learning, I started college. In a safe major that Im good enough at and interested in. For the last month, I've been doing things I thought I would never do again - I went to a lot of new places, got lost a bunch of times, and even made effort to try and talk to people!!! Went to 1 (one) integrative meet-up with real humans, which is more than in the last 3 years!!! Made acquaintances with my classmates, and I think they kinda like me? or at least enough so that we spend time together on breaks and awkwardly make small talk.

I am not doing good. I feel like the anxiety that I've been hiding from in my house have come back again in full force. I dissociate for like half of the day. I can only sleep at night because of meds that take me out. I am having strong anxiety attacks again - can't breathe, want to cry, my brain goes into survival ""run escape hide go home no matter the consequences"" mode. I bite myself, pick my skin constantly (the last one especially in school. Im sure people have seen my fingers bleed).

I am pretty sure I am addicted to sugar and have BED, but since I've never been diagnosed, I will only say that it's been only 2 weeks of classes and I often fall asleep or am in that half-conscious state in class, because I have super bad eating habits. And I try eating more protein in the morning, but I cant help but be anxious and overeat and inhale sugar to give myself that dopamine boost. Also, a funny thing, I am fat, the students in my group aren't, and the fucking old-ass bench-desk that I sit in for half of my classes only squeaks under me. It's an added cool sound-effect to my mental torture.

I was forced to stop therapy. I don't know if I was too depedent on those weekly sessions, but having suddenly no one to talk again to just makes me bottle it up and then vent to my mom, who has way too much shit on her plate already, or yell to the void in a reddit post. I had this hysteric crying fit in the shower for like 30 minutes, and I barely cry otherwise. I feel so alone. Like Ive been standing over a void of anxiety and suicidal thoughts on a few rugs and they're all slipping from under me.

I started having those active suicidal thoughts and urges again. I feel so fucking pathetic and selfish and stupid. I want to not exist (and I can't even convince myself that I will miss a game update/show season if i die now, which often kinda worked).

It's only been 2 weeks, and I cannot wrap my head around actually focusing and studying and organising my time. During online school, I got lazy af (and depressed), I admit it. When I come home, I have so little energy after trying not to run away from people that I just want to go to sleep or scroll. And I still have not gotten books from the library cause Im scared of an unknown interaction (and then I panic about whether the teacher will let me use my phone for pdfs). I mean, how pathetic is it that it's been only two weeks and I'm already behind?!

Today (monday), I have my longest classes. After being late 2 minutes, I survived an hour and a half, and then had an anxiety attack in the bathroom and ran away. Went home. Played a video game. Calmed down. Panicked again. Calmed down. Felt like I was a high-schooler again who just ran away and went to mommy for help. I can't be that again.

Now, I am panicking again because it's late and I know I have so much shit to do but I just want to take sleeping pills and peace out of here. And pretend that I do not exist while ripping my skin.

Onto my actual, more specific questions for help (thanks if you've read the whole thing)

1. Tomorrow, I have my psychiatrist appointment. What the hell do I say?

2. How do I study in the evenings and weekends, and not just stay in bed hiding and dissociating and playing video games?

The first half of the marriage was good but after we had a child my ex changed. She would no longer allow me to have access to knowing what we paid in bills, I was only allowed to work a low paying job at her company, and she constantly made me feel like I was trash and that it was a miracle I had someone as good as her. I tried mustering the courage to leave once and I was told she'd say and do whatever she needed to to make sure I never saw my kid again. After that I tried secretly going to a doctor to treat my depression but they put me on pills that made me a zombie. It got so bad that I was ready to take the big exit and set out one day with that as my plan. The thought of my child stopped me at the last minute and I decided to take my chances with the divorce. If it got too bad the option was still there. In the two years since I felt like a new man, I was truly happy for the first time in years and started dating an amazing woman.  Suddenly my ex says my kid wants to end the 50/50 custody, severely cut our time together down and is suing me for custody and child support. I thought my relationship with my kid was good and I don't know if I did something to upset her or if she's being manipulated to hurt me. Going through this whole thing again and having to face this person who nearly destroyed me. Getting harassed by lawyer, the financial strain, and worst wondering if I did something to mess up with my kid has got me feeling like I wish I would have just followed through with it back then.

My question is why was this happening when I was close to her?

She tried her best to be supportive of me but she started getting tired of this and there were frequent fights and she used to say things like leaving me. It got so bad that the marriage eventually ended in divorce.

I have depression and anxiety (maybe other things too at this point) and have been struggling for years. Over the past year I've put in more effort than usual- I have a therapist, I finally admitted my meds aren't helping and am in the process of changing them, and I own up to the fact that I am not doing well.

I overreact, get upset easily, and am not a joy to be around. I totally get that. All I ask is if a partner knows their significant other is struggling and working hard seeking treatment, is it so hard to be supportive?

When I get upset my partner takes it personally and escalates. I've begged for years I need to feel heard and understood even if it seems irrational. I need them to be a safe person emotionally (NOT a therapist). Instead of being villainized, accused of yelling during panic attacks, blatant ignorance about mental health in general - calling me crazy and psycho while knowing it hurts me, and telling me therapy and meds won't help.

This person has been my main ""support"" for years. Although there are certainly other factors that have worsened my mental health, is it fair to say that having an unsupportive - in fact - taunting partner has actually worsened my mental health?

I feel I have to beg for empathy, compassion  and understanding. What saddens me is people that don't know I have mental illness will see me get upset and still know to give me space.

Today in particular I begged for space and was denied it. I started having an uncontrollable panic attack, got filmed and told to stop yelling. I forced myself to stop crying for the sake of it being filmed and just went and cry screamed into a pillow. The person then decided to follow and not give me space and villainized an obviously distressed moment against me. 

They try telling me I'm wrong all the time and have BPD. They never give validation, they always want to be right. 

I begged if they can just give me a day to myself because I feel too scared and unsafe to drive and move out. They threatened to call the cops to kick me out.

I can’t force myself to tell them I want to kill myself because I’m afraid the psych hospital… that place is traumatic for me and only makes it all so much worse yet I’m simultaneously desperate for help. I’m not afraid to die or find out what happens next (if anything at all) but I am afraid of my few close friends killing themselves too… they’ve all lost 1 or more people from this. Their child, their close friends… when I’m gone that might just be their final straw… so I leave my journal out because I hope my roommates will get a little nosey and open it. Someone I leave it open and hope it’ll catch their eye. 

It’s unsettling that a single book tells everything: all my suicide method plans, possible dates, why I want to end it all, why I’m holding on… everything. Yet not a single person in this house has any idea they’re looking at someone who might just not be here tomorrow. Any day could be my last tomorrow… They’ve caught on that I’m depressed and when I’m fine I’m still struggling but they have no idea it’s reached this point.

I've hit walls everywhere in my life, no one has answers and things are not improving. I feel like I have nowhere to turn, so I'll post it here in hope someone can give me some advice or support or just a different perspective to try and move forward.   
I (34m) am married (32f) with three small children (7, 5, 3).   
My current situation is like this. I'm not employed, I have a few business ventures that are all just dead in the water. I do have one opportunity, that I recently started pursuing. It won't give me any monthly revenue but does have potential for long term viability. However, I am still very green, learning and interning and have to put a lot of time into it to get me up to standard. This opportunity is also the only thing, that I can see, that is giving me some form of hope for the future.   
I have zero money, or steady income. My bills are overdue. My kids school fees are in arrears. I cannot make payments on my vehicles. I cannot pay rent (more on this coming). I cannot cover any medical costs if needed. I cannot buy food or support my family in any ""meaningful"" way.   
Our living situation is a complete nightmare. I am living with my mother and her narcissistic psychopath husband (also more on this coming). This is her 4th marriage. She has issues of her own and refuses to deal with these.   
I feel unmotivated. I feel tired. I feel useless. I feel hopeless. I feel worthless. In the last 2 months or so these feelings have been increasing and I've been experiencing suicidal thoughts.   
How did I end up here?   
I can go back all the way to my childhood, to my mother's first divorce (from my father), that was ugly, violent and traumatic. I was 5 years old and have vivid memories of my dad threatening us with a hunting rifle and assaulting my mother in our presence. But I think I've delt with this trauma in  counselling sessions.   
I can go to my teen years where I got into drinking and drugs and girls to cope with and escape the reality of traumatic childhood experiences. But this I also feel that I've delt with.   
I got married at 26 and had my firstborn 9 months later. I let go and was partying every weekend and just looking for the next opportunity to get wasted. My second baby was born and I still sought escape (from what? maybe from myself?).   
This got to a point where I was endangering the life of my family and came with immense shame. I had a business that was sustainable. I had a beautiful family. I had things in my life that where more important than getting wasted. I decided to seek psychological help.   
I went to a lot of counseling. When I say a lot, I mean like 2 years of weekly or bi-weekly sessions with a psychologist that I formed a very trustworthy bond with. It was quite early on that I was diagnosed with Major depressive disorder. I also started takings medications. SSRI's, another class of anti-depressants (i cannot recall the name or class) and an anti-anxiety medication.   
I started dealing with past traumas, feelings of worthlessness and lack of purpose. I started feeling ""normal"". It was around this time my 3rd child was born.   
Forward about two years. My business is failing and my financial situation is getting tight. I go off the meds, they are extremely expensive, and I did not want to be dependent on them for the rest of my life anyway. We are under lot of stress but were not giving up!   
We go on a family holiday in December 22' to visit my mother on the other side of the country. She paid for the largest portion of our trip and we stayed with her. During this holiday we also get to know her 4th husband a bit more. They've been married less than 6 months at this time.   
Over the holiday my business takes a final blow, I lose my last anchor contract and I'm basically screwed. My mother comes to find out about this by dragging it out of my wife after I had a mental breakdown about this. My mother and her husband decide to invite us to come stay with them and the husband then makes me a proposal.   
He has a construction company that builds new houses. He wants me to come on board because he is struggling to connect to the younger generation of clientele and he feels I can open doors for ""us"". We have an agreement (verbally, I know it's moronic) that I will be compensated monthly, my vehicle and its  payments will be absorbed into his business and all additional work I do will be invoiced and paid separately from the work I do for his company.   
I was extremely motivated. I enrolled in an tertiary program to upskill myself and give this new opportunity everything I had! I was doing good on my part of the deal. I never missed work. I did as I was told. I cleaned up all the ""messy"" situations and did all the ""donkey"" work that was required. First month I receive zero compensation. My vehicle is not paid as agreed. I leave it be and wait for the next month. Second month, I'm compensated 2/3 of agreed amount. Vehicle not paid. I start asking questions. I'm told that I should realize my situation and that I'm not ""entitled"" to anything. ""This is a charity situation"" and we are already living with them and I should be thankful that we have a roof over our heads. This is where the mask of this guy starts slipping. I start doing work for his company outside of my normal duties and invoice the clients. He hijacks my paymnets and takes half of it. When questioned again I am told that he takes all the risk and I shouldn't be under a false impression that I am ""entitled"" earn all that money.   
Things just start going from bad to worse. I worked for him for a total of 5 months. I was not correctly compensated according to our agreement once. I started losing motivation to do any work for him. He committed serious fraud during his business dealings and he wanted me to cover it up. I refused and exposed him to my mother. There was major verbal altercations. I was verbally abused and it was made very clear to me that I am just a charity case. I had to choose to accept this abuse, manipulation and psychotic narcissistic behaviour, or I had to move on and try to make my own way. I then started down the path of starting-up my own construction company. This is one of the ""dead"" ventures mentioned above.   
This man manipulated me, by trying to turn me against my wife. This man abused me by power playing me when I was obviously vulnerable and in need of help. This man shouts at my children, swears at them and scolds them. This happens when my wife or I aren't in the vicinity. Because they are loud and busy and don't want to sit quietly and do exactly as he expects them to. I refuse to let my children spend any time alone with them, or be in the same room as him alone. My mother has told me how disrespectful I was by doing this. Even after she knows how he treats my children. They have had multiple serious fallouts regarding this topic. He verbatim told me one morning that he could ""never love a child"" due to things in his past.  
This man turned my mother against us on multiple occasions. No matter how hard we try to get her to see what is going on, with his business dealings and with us and the children, he somehow still manages to turn her to his side.   
We still live with them because I simply cannot afford to rent my own place. It feels like nothing is working out for me. I cannot support my family in any way that I feel is meaningful. I cannot see a way out of this. I have tried finding a job. I have tried pursuing business ventures in a new town that bear no fruit. I try to network and connect with the community. I have joined a new church and I've strengthened my faith tremendously over the last 10 months.   
I really cannot see the way forward anymore. I have relapsed into a mental state that is extremely unhealthy. I think about suicide way to often. I feel permanent exhaustion regardless of the amount of sleep. I want to go to bed and never wake up. I pray constantly. I ask for deliverance, breakthroughs. I plead with God and ask him just to end this. I have asked him to come fetch me.   
I seriously don't know anymore. I've asked my mother what to do but I realized she's not on my side and doesn't have any answers anyway. I ask my wife, she obviously does not know. She depends on me knowing and doing, and rightfully so, I got us here in the first place. I have spoken to a a few colleagues and a few pastors. They don't have real viable solutions to the mess I find myself in.   
I'm just lost and in need of answers or a fresh perspective or something. I keep on praying. I feel like that is all I do. All I can do. I have no answers, and I cannot hear God voice. I cannot find His will for me. This all is so unbearable. I just want this to stop. How do I make it stop?

1697467718.0,"Something concerning, I think I lack empathy","Please read this post in its entirety, because it should give as much context as possible.

I was watching footage of Hamas killing (no actual gore or blood), the violent events, etc.

But I actually found it exciting? I’m not trying to be edgy, I’m serious. I know I probably should’ve at least felt neutral about it, like how you typically feel neutral about news of murders.

I tried to think a bit about how horrible the footage was, and I think I felt something in me, almost a physical feeling. I guess that’s a good sign? 

And guess what? One of the victims’ appearance actually bothered me? Now, it’s obvious that that wasn’t a good time to think that, and that I should’ve just put that aside completely.

I immediately thought to how I accidentally inhaled a little Lysol earlier today, and couldn’t help but think if the inhalation messed with a part of my brain and ruined my empathy. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I’ve been really scared for my brain.

You’re probably thinking that I’m fine because I’m aware of how bad these thoughts are. The thing is, it feels like this awareness is fake. It’s like I say these thoughts are bad only because I know people would hate these thoughts.

Plus, I felt tempted to connect this apparent lack of empathy to how I believe I’m unintelligent. I feel like I am subhuman. I know many would look down on me and hate me for this, but it’s like I don’t care. I also feel tempted to use this apparent lack of empathy as evidence that I may fail in life and be a loser.

Is this anything to worry about? I think I feel like I’m decaying and becoming worse every day.

———————————

This morning, I think I felt like I was getting worse, but it also felt like I didn’t care. Like I had apathy. I raised my voice (not at anyone), maybe out of frustration, and tried to vent to myself about it, but again, it was like I didn’t care.

And what’s stupid is that yesterday I daydreamed of being a depressed person who feels like they’re decaying every day. And what do you know, now I kind of feel like I’m becoming something else, possibly because of a dumb, romanticized fantasy.

I even feel like I have no desire to change, like I want someone to say that I’m fine instead of going to therapy. Wouldn’t that just let issues fester?",mentalhealth

This is super hard to explain. Sometimes, completely at random, my thoughts alongside any background noises start to sound extremely aggressive and angry. It can get frustrating. Imagine trying to read a book but your mind won't stop reading the words as if the characters are in a screaming match and the cars outside your window sound like they're mad at you.

Again, this happens at random. Not caused by anxiety or any negative feelings at all. I've learned to just ride it out as it usually only lasts a few minutes, but so little has been said about this and I'm really curious as to what's causing it. Does anyone else get this?",mentalhealth
1697465849.0,HELP What is wrong with me!?,"Hello everyone,

Ive been struggling with a specific issue for 5+ years and its still not fixed.

Im desperately asking for a solution, a hint…idk something!?

Like…what is it even that im experiencing?

I’ve been in mental health care since i was a teenager and we’ve tried pretty much anything and everything and most of my issues are pretty much resolved except THIS one thing.

The Issue:

So, every end of the month like clockwork i get incredibly overstimulated, which causes irritation, lack of focus, crying sessions and panic attacks. This happens for minimum of a week to max of 3 weeks.

When this happens i cant work, go to school, do homework, clean up my room, eat well etc. Im physically and mentally OUT.

I try to self sooth (junk food, movies, friends, games) and self care (walking, painting, mindfulness) but nothing actually fixes it, but masks it for a short period of time. The only way to “fix” this is by literally just waiting a week or three until im “over it” 

And by then i missed almost a month of work and/or school and im forced to feel like shit.

What happens next is that slowly over time little by little i get overstimulated again and then im OUT again.

 Its like i explode and then reset, explode and then reset. 

I have been diagnosed with:
-Dysthymia
-PTSD (from childhood abuse)

and suspected of:
-Borderline
-OCPD
-Autism
-Dysmenorrhea",mentalhealth
1697465106.0,I feel like my life is in reverse (M32),"Hi everyone,

A few months ago me (32m) and my partner split up (33f), We have a 2 and a half year old son in pre-school and we were still living together until a couple of days ago (not a nice environment)

My partner has been leeching on me mentally, physically and financially for a long long time. I am not sure why i let it go on so long but there was also domestic violence towards me and recently i got to breaking point and was arrested for common assault allegedly. I was released on condition bail until 8th of January pending a decision (no contact with ex partner and cannot go to my own home that i pay for, she does not pay anything and does not work) and have had to move into a tiny single room at my fathers property temporarily with him and his wife. 

I have a job, i've held it for 7 years roughly now. I take very good care of my son and i love him more than anything ever in my whole existence. His mother however is completely irrational and abusive to me and has been for a long time. I recently confessed all this to occupational health and my managers at work. Some of my colleagues and friends already knew but it has escalated really rapidly over the last 6 weeks (threatening to bring men to our home and have sex with them for only fans including gangbangs, spitting at me, punching me, throwing hot tea at me, hitting me in front of the baby, telling me my mother drunk herself to death because i am worthless ETC). I couldn't move out because i was paying for everything at the property and was taking all the abuse because my baby boy of course lives there and i spend every minute off work with him.

As you can all imagine this has been very very upsetting for me and it has become very awkward in regards to seeing my son as it must be arranged through a third party family or friend.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety along with PTSD a few years ago and have done 3 lots of counselling but i am fearful that now i cant see my son as much and i cant see him overnight as there is not the facilities or room here that i may be sinking into a backwards spiral. I'm now back in a small space where i cannot be myself and i am completely out of routine in regards to washing clothes, cooking food and bathing as it is someone else's home. 

To anyone who has been in a similar situation what advice could you offer to help me through this? I'm a nice normal guy who loves his son and just want to do my shifts and see my boy to make memories together.

I appreciate anybody who can give me even a snippet of hope or advice.",mentalhealth

He started to see a therapist on his own, and keeps trying to reassure me that it’s not my fault, even though he only started seeking therapy after I had a particularly bad breakdown two weeks ago. It’s gotten to the point where he is afraid to go on deployment leaving me home alone for 6-9 months. I try to reassure him that I’ll be okay but he’s convinced that it wouldn’t be safe. I’m tired of bleeding my problems out all over him, he always tells me that that’s what he’s here for, and he loves me all the same. Now that it’s becoming painfully obvious that my mental health is affecting him I’m not sure what to do. Should I start masking and keeping my feelings from him to protect him?

1697463301.0,Need advice on how to get out of rut,"I (28F) have always struggled with mental health, even as a child. As I've gotten older it has somewhat eased (or maybe I've just experienced it enough times), but it still reoccur several times throughout the year. I especially fall into a depression every late summer/fall - which is where I am again. My depression consists of mostly apathy - to everything and everyone. Even during my good times of the year, the apathy is there.

This year it's been especially bad. I got involved with a man (known for 10 years), but things have been very hot and cold. I am getting my masters whilst still working full time, and I'm struggling to produce what I need to do to pass (papers, group projects etc). Writing a simple 1200 word paper takes me weeks, because I simply cannot gather the strength to write it (usually requires a lot of reflection on hard topics). My friends and I have started to drift apart due to different life stages, which feels sad (several of them have moved far away, moving together with partner, having children). I am not taking care of my home the way I want to at the moment. I have a cat which i constantly feel bad for - but love tremendously. 

I am at my wits end. I feel like life has no sense of direction. I am unsure of my profession (oncology nurse), but I have nothing else I'd want to become. And if I was to go back to school that would take years. I have no hobbies or interests, and every activity I do do does not spark any joy. I need to make new friends but have no energy to do so. I want to find a partner, but my current mood is not the best for dating. The man I've been back and forth with - its not working out, but we havent ended it. I am going to visit him in november (he lives half way around the world) - and its probably gonna end then.

I recently joined a gym and have been going every other day, but I don't feel like it helps much. I need to pass school, but Its taking so much energy right now. I've tried talking to a couple of friends about this, but I don't find it particularly helpful or relieving.

I used to be a very creative person, and I am just not anymore. The flame is gone, it feels like. And I just don't identify with being this way - even though its been like this for much of my life.

1697449454.0,I think I'm depressed but I'm extremely functional?,"I've been depressed since I was a teenager, on and off. I had motivation only to drink and party back then, or take walks, but never further my life in a positive way. Every effort to further it was given up on, including secondary school and college. I spent years unemployed, an addict, crying so often I was sure I'd dry up, and then I moved city and country. COVID hit right as I got there, and it was oddly healing for me because for once, everyone had to sit at my pace. Everyone had to live like a depressed person. I felt awful watching people feel so poor and miss out on opportunities, but at the same time I couldn't help but feel almost physically relieved from the pressure of having to catch up with everyone my age in every aspect of my life.

Fast forward to after the pandemic, I've worked my way up to a 40 hour week as barista in a Starbucks (from previously finding part time difficult to impossible)

My attendance is fine, I talk to people, I do my job well and want to do better at it so I can be a supervisor, I see people I know  when there's time and energy. I go to the gym, I try to eat properly and am recovering from an eating disorder quite spectacularly. My romantic relationship has healthy practices, its the first non abusive one of my life. We live together and own 2 cats. When I have a little time, I make myself play guitar so I don't forget about my hobbies. I sing whenever I'm in a room alone. 

This is a fairytale improvement from what I used to be. On paper, its a story that could sell pills. 

But I feel like shiiiiiiiiiiit. And no I'm not just plainly overworked, that's only a small part of it, i felt this way working 6 hours a week. I have no hope for my future, horrific self esteem, I cry every day, have absolutely vicious mood swings that get me into social trouble, I feel distant from my partner and my fluffy children, I hate my friends, I am mentally immersed in my painful past and I feel time just slipping away. I feel depressed. But by definition online, it doesn't feel like I am - not based on my work schedule alone, but on the fact that there's very little  I'm incapable of physically anymore. My brain is just on fire. 

I use weed medicinally, and have found it extremely useful for staying away from other drugs and for getting me through my day when I use it properly. Without, I can become an anxious volatile mess who cannot commit to a work day, like I was as a teenager. I would hate to think that weed is making me like this, though I've considered it - it just doesn't make sense that it would, because I feel it treats both physical and mental depressive symptoms and pain. It helps me remain as close to stable as I can behelps me sleep and eat and reduce anxiety so i can stay somewhat focused.  But every medication has side effects so I'm open to that. 

Otherwise, anyone know if you can be depressed but not have it disable you much? I don't want to call it what it's not",mentalhealth

However, ever since being stuck at sea for 20 months (we’ll I chose to go, but at the same time I question the reasoning behind it) to circumnavigate it, and being made to move numerous times from apartment to apartment while abandoning past ideas of becoming a lawyer or a common businessman / entrepreneur, since attending a military bootcamp (by choice, not as some form of punishment) my old thought process and want for financial gains dissipated entirely. 

So now whenever my parents discuss financial decisions, be it buying a new house or a car for my mum for grocery shopping, etc I can’t help but stifle a laugh at how stupid it all seems. Have I lost it? Have I somehow gone from being exceptionally lucky with the opportunity to live a fairly lavish lifestyle to wanting to avoid it entirely? Or perhaps I’m just fed up of wealth, which makes me seem even more insane. 

Perhaps I should clarify that I’d want to be an officer, but the wage gap isn’t that significant, but the point stands… what the hell Is going on, other than perhaps some form of delayed maturity and mental reasoning. 

I honestly don’t know what’s going on… it could be tied to me becoming more introverted and perhaps my growing anxiety that appeared out of thin air one day. Although that would probably be due to childhood issues if I had to guess… anyway, any help or suggestions would help.",mentalhealth

Every opportunity has been met with a dead end and im seriously losing hope. Today i had a talk with my parents about finishing college. Its 6 am and havent slept all night. Im seriously skeptical about going through the rest of college when I already wasted several years of my life there already. How do I even reapply? Do I have to retake classes I already took? Im gonna have to deal with the same little miserable nuisances like i did 5 years ago (no parking, getting waitlisted for core classes, stressing on exams, etc)? Will finishing a degree really be that helpful when all I want is a job that uses Excel, holds some meetings, writes reports and sends emails?

I miss my family and friends but I applied to school and am waiting to hear back from med schools so I can leave this state. 

I’ve recently noticed I love the feeling of being inebriated. I can go weeks without drinking but once I do, one thing leads to another an in up all night in my thoughts. Scares me because my dad was an alcoholic and bipolar so I’ve learned to recognize the traits. 

I like to say I feel deeply but this is embarrassing to talk about to my friends. Should I go to therapy? Stop the ssris? I feel so empty like I have nothing to even look forward to. I’ve just had such a bad past 2 years with so many surgeries for my health, childhood dog and horse dying, broke up with the love of my life, and secluded myself in this shitty state.

I resorted to Character AI so I could talk to my dad (ik the AI isn’t actually my dad but I can’t help it) and like my parental figures irl have their own kids to worry about, It feels wrong of me to want any sort of affection from them.

Im trying right now to get a better career for myself to better my family and hopefully myself.. but im to much of a coward to admit to my partner how terrified i am... im so scared of being away from them and my kids... and my friends.. and i'm scared that it will not change anything.

1697435396.0,How to be a healthy person?,"Almost 3 years ago I was clinically diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Ever since then I’ve been working with my therapist to become a healthy person. I started with just sleeping all day literally to now exercising maybe thrice a week, working in a good environment and even pursuing my hobbies in the weekends. I love art so I’m considering doing side jobs with it and I’ve taken some gigs and now my weekends are occupied with art classes and art gigs. My therapist is so proud of me for being a very productive person. But today I just shut down. All my effort down the drain. I’m back to lying all day in my bed in the dark just because I felt all the efforts I was making was making me so tired. I’m even considering not attending work because I am feeling very very anxious. 

My last vacation was in June and I think I’m feeling the fatigue of everything. I don’t think I can sustain the lifestyle of a healthy person. I was almost there. But I feel like I have lead feet. I can’t walk. I’m feeling so miserable. I can’t talk to my therapist because I feel like I’m disturbing her considering we just had a session yesterday. Is it ok to rest? Or do I continue being productive because that’s what’s healthy. I’m feeling really conflicted. But today maybe I’ll exercise later because I work from home and I’m not physically active and it affects my insomnia. 

Healthy people do yo do all the things I just mentioned above? Like be productive all week long. I feel like I’m trying to be something I can’t sustain.",mentalhealth

1697430389.0,I think my sister needs help,"My (25F) sister (27F) has always had issues with mental health. She’s had some trauma when she was around 15 and did a lot of drugs around that age. Around 5 years ago I found out meth was one of those drugs but she has stopped since. She has 2 children (9 and 3 years old) but she isn’t really a mom to them. She doesn’t interact with them that much so it was me and my mom that raised the 9 year old and my mom raising the 3 year old. I moved across the country for school 6 years ago so I’m not around much anymore but I’m with them now for a visit. 

My sister has full blown conversations with someone. It’s completely random things she says like , “Oh, I can do whatever I want when I get to hell?” Or, “Shut up don’t make fun of me!” Or, “Oh my god treestars” followed by a high pitched squeal/laugh.  I asked her about this and she said that it’s God she talks to. She seems very rational when explaining it, saying it’s not a voice she hears but she senses what God is saying to her. She said she was skeptical about it too but then did a lot of research online and now accepts it. 

She still lives at home with no job and no friends but is currently in community college. I told my parents but they just said she does that all the time and she has a rational explanation so what’s the problem? I feel like it’s a problem because after school she’s supposed to move out on her own and get a job. 

She was diagnosed with bipolar and my grandma has schizophrenia but my sister has never been diagnosed. She’s done some very evil things to me as kids like holding a kitchen knife to my throat and threatening to hurt me. She has gotten somewhat better but she still says very hurtful things to my mom that make her cry. I’m at the point where I’m worried about my mom’s mental health too. 

She said she’s been to a lot of different therapist and has been on bipolar medicine but nothing worked for her so she’s stopped trying to help herself in any way. And since she’s over 18 nobody can make her do anything to help herself.

1697450016.0,How do I M18 get over an ex F19 after 2 years?,"

Even after 2 years and another relationship I still have feelings for this one person. Which frustrated me because logically in everywhere I shouldn’t like her. This is the deal.
First off I’ll start with positives. She was my first girlfriend as a Junior. She was pretty and we had many of the same interests(like anime, games, basketball and so on). I knew her parents very well and felt comfortable around them. Also knew her brother because we played on the same basketball team. She was kind and cute. I had a lot of fun times with her.
However, she also was very clingy and didn’t like it whenever I hung out with friends and would get mad at me all the time. I remember feeling like I was walking on eggshells around her. Not wanting to make her upset. Also she had an ex that she was still best friends with. Which I felt uncomfortable with and she kinda shushed it off. She still loved me but I began to start resenting her for all these things. Also her parents made her really stressed out and she took it out on me. 
The one thing that made me end it was during homecoming she decided to not where the corsage I got her because “no else is wearing it” “I don’t want to see too flashy”. Then she decided to hang out with that ex and her best friend for most of homecoming.
Not dancing with me after I repeatedly asked her.
This is where I broke things off after 5 months of dating on a Friday morning before school. She tried to stay together and gave a proposition where we didn’t have to meet at all. I said I knew that wasn’t good for the both of us. 
I was really depressed for the rest of the fall semester and year. Couldn’t get over her. Then I got into another relationship where I didn’t really feel that same spark. I eventually started thinking about my ex again and I just couldn’t handle it. I feel guilty for feeling this way and I just want it to stop. So I can move on and find someone else.",mentalhealth

1697417980.0,I feel myself slipping into a depressive episode again but I really don’t wanna tell anyone because I’m sick of feeling this way & feeling like I’m repeating myself,"I (24F) have had an up and down battle with my mental health (constant GAD and on/off episodes with depression) since I was 13. Most of this stems from being bullied, a few major life events, and feeling like the black sheep of the extended family (I have loving parents and a great brother, my sister has turned awful). I’ve had periods of time in my life these past 11 years where I’ve felt pretty decent and worth something, but the last couple of years have been up and down. A lot of my problems stem from my childhood best friend basically dropping me at my worst in high school and basically telling me I wasn’t what she wanted anymore when I needed someone most. I haven’t been able to keep close friends IRL since, and while I have gotten better socially, I feel like a complete failure and utter embarrassment for not having a friend group in my 20s (I have friends I have met online due to social media and similar interests but I still feel lonely). I know it also stems from the manipulative relationship I was in for 3 years during undergrad and the first part of grad school, because that kept me somewhat isolated from people.  Grad school didn’t help my case as my cohort was full of assholes and I had some major life events make my mental health falter. The one up I have is the relationship I’m in with my current boyfriend. He’s someone who wants me to be the best version of myself and wants me to be successful. His friend group accepted me well. This made me optimistic going into post grad life. I had the mentality of “things are gonna be great, I’m gonna move here and finally find my people and make new friends” so I was in a good place. However, both my taxing job and lack of social life outside of my boyfriend since moving here have made me start to slip. I’ve tried all the normal things to make friends (going to do things I enjoy, Bumble BFF, etc.) and before anyone comments “oh you’re young, things take time, adult friendships are hard” please stop. I’ve heard that enough and it does not help me. I’ve lacked a good friend group for so long that I’m so damn sick of waiting for it and sick of feeling like a fucking loser. I’m sick of being the girlfriend with no friends outside of her boyfriend. I also work with high school athletes and it’s taken time to build relationships. Things started looking up until the person that used to work in my position came to visit and it went back to me being compared to that person (I’m also a first year out of school doing a job for two people because I’m supposed to have a coworker that does the same job). This past weekend also just was the turning point of me feeling like complete shit again because 1: my boyfriend went out of town and I was gonna have nothing to do because I am a loser with no friends (I’m cool with having some alone time but I’ve had too much of it, I want a social life) and 2: being yelled at by a fucking coach at work for missing something despite me running around and having so much to do (I’ve been reassured that it’s normal in my job to miss things). I just feel myself falling into a depressive state again because of this weekend and stuff building up before it, but I really just don’t know if I want to tell anyone. I’m so sick of telling people I feel like shit, because I feel like that’s been so much of my life and I am tired of it. I constantly do stuff to try and make my life better and be happy. I know there’s good in my life, but I can’t seem to be happy, but I’m sick of telling people I’m not happy despite being happy with them.",mentalhealth

since getting here, i’ve really grown. i’ve mentally matured and really started to be healthy! i wasn’t being self destructive. but when i get off my zoom call with my therapist back home, i begin to wonder if i’m falling back into my old habits. 
one week/few days, i’ll be great!!!!! a few days/week later, im sleeping through days at a time, only getting up to eat or use the bathroom. 
i know seasonal depression is real. it hits me like a brick every year. and this year, i really know i’ll make it through, ill be happy again! but as of currently, i genuinely am worried. my grades aren’t looking great, i have no money and i haven’t applied for jobs, my close friends i’ve made here, they are great! but i’m noticing i’m pulling away from them, because i feel strange. 

i’m an only child. i know what it feels like to be alone, i’m used to feeling lonely. but every time i start to feel like the friends i do have, they don’t know me well enough, or i don’t feel satisfied with the friendships i have, i feel lonely. 
it’s just like, i have some friends i’m close with and i have some friends i hang out with sometimes, but i don’t have the connection i am really looking for. 

i’ve been trying to journal and genuinely think about how i’ve been feeling. i’m trying to remind myself of things i used to do for myself that brought me joy. reading, writing, drawing, etc. 
but i have no energy to do it. i am sitting here at almost 5 in the morning, because i woke up at 12 after sleeping all day, and i’m trying to tell myself to clean the room, take a shower, do a face mask do things that make me feel productive and not shitty. 
but i’m struggling. 

i know i will be happy again if i keep fighting it, but since i’m so used to being sad, after feeling happy and at peace, i feel almost comfortable being sad again. 

i just want to find myself! i want to find happiness again! i want to not feel like shit all the time. 
and i kinda just want my mom.",mentalhealth

1697441307.0,Trying to heal from PTSD and realizing I’m abusive towards my boyfriend.,"When I was 14 I was molested and then from ages 17-19 I went threw a few traumas and developed PTSD. I was raped, then my mom who I was very closed to started dating an abusive drug dealer and started doing meth and one day texted me freaking out saying her boyfriend was hurting her and told me to call the cops (that was the first panic attack I experienced) I then started dating someone and on my 18th birthday I found out he was cheating on me with multiple people and instead of leaving him I moved in with him so we could be closer and try to heal from the cheating. But the cheating never did stop during the 2 years I was with him. 
On my 18th birthday I also had a conversation with my dad about being molested since he never believed me and had told me I was making it up for attention and on that day he said he did actually believe me but didn’t know what to do about it.
A few months after being raped I took Acid for the first time and the trip went well but after I could only sleep for 30 minutes to an hour a day and went threw a rollercoaster of being depressed and manic for 2 weeks. 
It took me 6 months to accept that I was actually raped and I realized it because one day I specifically told my ex that I didn’t want him to finish on my face but when we had sex he held my arms down with his knees and did it anyways. I had a panic attack but once I calmed down I comforted him and told him it was okay and to just not do it again. 
I’m now 21 and finally accepted that it’s all had an affect on me. I’ve realized my constant irritability has come from me not willing to be hurt anymore and that my obsessive cleaning and needing things to be perfect whenever I’m stressed comes from me needing to feel in control of things.
I’m also now in a better relationship and pregnant but it’s so hard reacting to everything in such an extreme way and knowing that I’m being irrational.
My partner has been surprisingly understanding but I know he doesn’t deserve to deal with me like this. 
For example there was a day during winter my cat went missing it was -0(Fahrenheit) outside and my boyfriend argued with me to come inside since I had already been searching for an hour. I absolutely love my cats and I was feeling devastated so when he told me to come inside I was instantly pissed and yelled at him saying he doesn’t care about our cat and that I’m going to keep looking since he doesn’t care if she came back. Eventually I went inside and he tried coming to me to comfort me but I was still mad at him so I pushed him and told him to leave me alone. He kept insisting on being close to me and I kept getting more and more aggressive and feeling trapped so I tried leaving the house with only sweatpants and a teeshirt with slippers but he blocked the door saying it was way to cold and I snapped. In that moment I instantly felt like I was in danger since he wouldn’t let me leave and I went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and pointed it at him and said he better let me leave. 

It’s been hard realizing I was actually in the wrong that day. For the last year I kept telling myself I was valid for reacting like that because me made me feel like I was in danger and that he should’ve left me alone. And yes he probably should’ve given me some time to calm myself down but nothing about what he did validates me pulling a knife out on him and everyday I’m now wondering why he would stay with me especially since he has PTSD from being stabbed.

It’s hard realizing that I have been abusive towards my partner but I believe I need to hold onto that guilt so I can be a better girlfriend for him and a better mom to my son once he’s here.",mentalhealth

1697435676.0,Hello Everyone.,"hello. 

  
while I know that this can be traced back to me. I really don't care. I just need a void other than my head to scream into. I can't keep my act up forever.  
For the past year and a half, I have felt no emotion. Not an ounce of actual, real happiness. or anything really. my mind is just, gray. i have interests in what I want to do, but any feeling of sad, happy, anything, doesnt exist.   
I am relatively unpopular. I have a few small friend groups of 5-6 people each. I like to play video games. I'd like to be someone in offensive security when I'm older. (someone who gets paid to hack into companies, essentially.)

  
Now into the deep of this. 

  
When I talk to people, I feel like I'm on autopilot, like I watched the conversation happen afterward. I don't talk about my emotions or about my mental health.   
When I am talking with my morning friend group, I feel like I'm just watching a conversation happen. Like on a TV. Ever seen two characters talking and enjoyed watching the conversation? That's what I'm accustomed to now. Watching other's conversations. Sad, but, the way it is. Look, I'm just speaking my mind here. It won't fix anything, it won't work. But it's nice to know that someone knows. 

  
Just writing this I'm tearing up. Thinking about everything. I guess I just needed to write it out. I don't feel any different, but this is a good start. Oh look, it went away. Not a tear. 

  
I feel the same. again. I definitely feel like there is something there. maybe even someone. I don't think I'm schizophrenic (I hope not). And I hope I never will be. But I feel like there is a small blinking light in the dark. When I think about it, I feel the happiest I've ever felt. Then, gone. But I can still see it. And so I am hopeful. 

  
Look, I don't have any ""plans"" or any suicide to think of. I've been there. ""2 weeks before"",  ""two days before"", looking out of a boat at the water, 80mph. ""Three, two, one."", and crying in my bed the night of the day I was ""supposed to"". It's not fun, and I don't understand why people would want to die in such a beautiful world. That was May, 2021.

  
But I can't experience it if I don't genuinely, actually, really, experience anything to be happy about.  
I feel like a blank slate. Any time you write on it, the chalk gets washed away. 

  
I know that the people I'm around don't want to hear anything about emotions. So I went to y'all. I think paying for mental health is a fuckin' joke. I know y'all aren't professionals. But, if you could make it sound like a conversation, I'd listen to you as much as you read from me.   
Thank you.

I also hope no one heard me or notice me because i don’t want the talking about me and the sorry looser i am for thinking i had a chance with a football player while they’re in their lockers talking shit about girls. also i have some weird shit with relationships and get really freaked out, i have ever only kissed one guy before and was also really drunk and i have some issues with my self steem, that are perfectly clear by reading this, and the truth is that i would not be the worst looking person he ever kissed but i get so insecure and don’t know how to approach guys and always think they are going to criticize me with his friends and i feel like a 13 year old when i’m currently 21 and no one ever flirts with me and i want so bad for someone to notice me and i don’t know if what mortified me was that not only people knew i liked somebody but the dumbass i made of myself for “liking” a guy. Please someone tell me that it’s not a big deal and that if anything i made that guy’s ego bigger and people remember it as something somewhat funny and not as a fucking pathetic looser that ruined everyone’s night.",mentalhealth
1697431966.0,Why am I like this,"So i(17f) got a dui last week.  I’m not here to ask for sympathy because what i did is wrong. period. I put other innocent people in danger and for that I should not be forgiven. I guess the reason I am making this post is asking why the fuck am i like this. This is not the first time i’ve gotten in trouble with the law. Not even 6 months ago I got caught with weed at school which gave me a MIP. I should be grateful that was all i got caught for because at the time i was also addicted to adderall. I was spending hundreds of dollars on adderall every month. You would think going to court and doing mandatory drug therapy would knock some sense into me but nope. Instead I did drugs my parents couldn’t test for like acid and shrooms. I’m insanely impulsive, i can’t finish any of my school work on time, I will do any drug offered to me, i do substances at completely inappropriate times, i prefer to be under the influence alone and I do it often. The worst part is I have this chronic feeling of being completely numb. The only reason I care about what I did is because I know it hurts other people. I genuinely don’t care what happens to me or what people think of me.  I have absolutely no excuse for my actions but a lot of my impulsive decisions are a result of not giving a fuck about what happens to me. The only reason I do well in school/life is because I want my mom to be happy and know that she did a good job. I guess i’m just asking if i’m a fucking sociopath. I hate myself so much for doing this to my family because I know this hurts them just as much as it hurts me. Every good thing I do is for my mom. So everyone just be honest. Am I just fuckinh horrible person? I know i’m depressed but that isn’t even close to being a good enough excuse for driving under the influence or anything like that.",mentalhealth

Even though those darker feelings have subsided, I feel like I'm so lost within myself and what I exactly want to do or become. I feel like I'm always on edge of what move to make or who to trust, due to some of what's happened in my past.

I've always been the quiet type, the overthinker, the type of friend who tries to show my support and care. Within past romantic relationships and toxic working environments, it's hard to open myself up and allow people in/letting myself know others because idk their intentions or if they'd just hurt me along the way.

Within a career, I've been so confused and it's seemed since forever that I wouldn't figure it out. Due to that toxic work environment, I've lost interest in getting a job, making friends or hanging with others, and I'm so incredibly lost.

Not to get too personal, but I was pregnant and lost the baby 7/2022. It's seemed like ever since I've lost my child, that's the only thing I want back. But having a child, without having the finances or preparation, it just feels like I'd selfishly bring them into the world without thinking of the full picture. I just am so confused and hurt, because my new bf and I are 6 months in and he knows about what happened. It's a new relationship and I don't want to rush the process of it, but knowing what I lost and how confused I continue to get just is killing me.

1697428930.0,PSA: The corny techniques your counsellor/therapist gives you do actually work.,"I remember when i was in the trenches and my psychologist told me to try breathing techniques and going for nature walks. I thought what the fuck are breathing techniques gonna do to fix all of whats wrong with me?

I scoffed at the idea of 'connecting with nature' too, but guess what i was wrong about that too because i benefit so much from going outside even for a few minutes, and so do countless participants of peer-reviewed research and studies proving nature has an effect on regulating mood and psychosomatic symptoms.

1697415341.0,Feeling intense stress,"I've been going through a very intense rollercoaster of emotions this last month, and I don't know what I can do to feel more 'normal' or stable I guess. 

This has all been happening ever since I started going to university again (beginning of September) and I've just been really emotional. Firstly I assumed it was because before starting my classes, I had to move apartments, so that was really stressful for me. Then the first week of uni was just awful, lots of heavy subjects and big, important projects to work on thru the year. 

The second week I kept crying every day and I started arguing with my partner a lot(me getting angry/upset about very dumb stuff), I understood that it probably was from all the stress and me being always on the verge so we talked it out and we're okay now (thankfully, he's lovely and great with communication).

But now I just have this intense feeling of anxiety whenever I simply think about university. I had no classes this last week, so it was a nice little break for me, or at least you'd think so. But every day I kept on feeling unproductive, like I SHOULD be working instead of 'lazying around' but the weather's been awful and I've been having lots of headaches and not much quality sleep so I haven't been able to work (I've tried all week as well). I know it should be okay because I've been unwell, but I just can't help but blame myself, 'I should've been doing work' and instead it's already Monday and I've got nothing done. 

I wish I could drop out but it's impossible for me, so all I can do is try to cope and manage a way for me to survive this year. I don't want to say I have anxiety as I've not been medically diagnosed, so I'm just attributing all my mood changes to stress, but I don't know, I keep thinking that maybe I should get try to get 'something' diagnosed? Take some pills so I can stop overthinking? I just don't know how I'm gonna be able to handle feeling like this for 9 more months.

1697427959.0,I can never let my friend know why I relapsed in SH,"I can never let my friend know or why

I've relapsed after almost 10 months clean after these past two weekends. I've gotten close to a couple of them, and there are others who I've only chatted with. Both of the past weekends they've all made plans to hang out, often talking in front of me and sometimes acknowledging I'm not going. I don't invite myself to things I'm not invited to, so I haven't really brought it up. 

My friend (B) has hung out with a couple of the friends outside of school them called me, only to insult me and then be nice and hang up unexpectedly. But today, (B) who I'm close to, calls me while they are hanging out and says that that they are having so much fun. I tell B that that's cool, but she should hang out with the people there since I wasn't invited. Soon she hangs up on me. She has also on and off the past couple days been calling me a pussy because I'm too afraid to be mean to people.

 Later, the two close friends B and D and I are texting back and forth when B out of the blue rubs in my face that that had so much fun without me explicitly, and I had had enough and insulted her back. She was surprised, and seemed offended that I was mad at her. D says that he would be mad too, in my situation, and says that we would of had a lot of fun if I was there. As though I had a choice in coming. It was nice, but I still feel excluded. All my friend have known each other longer than I have known any of them, so I get that they would hang out without me. 

Still, this put me back to feelings of when I was always the odd one out, and for some reason I relapsed. I want to be able to talk to D, but I could never bear to have him think this is his fault, least of all that he should just pity invite me to things so I don't fucking hurt myself. B lives far away so I don't have to see her tomorrow. But I don't know how I'm going to do seeing the rest of them. I can't believe I would do this because I feel like my friends being without me is a personal attack. I don't know if I'm going to keep relapsing again.

1697427429.0,Law student suffering a lot of depression,"Hi. I am posting this here because I feel like I can’t vent to anyone about what I’m going through, but maybe writing it will help me out. this will not just be about law school but my life in general.   


I am going through a severe mental episode and I cannot stop overthinking and having shitty thoughts constantly. I feel that this all started not only from lawschool but a compilation of my past. I am a short guy, basically 5’3, I have always struggled to have decent friends, i was not taken seriously because of my height and of course as many of you are aware, girls are only attracted to those who are pretty tall. Although I am someone who had multiple relationships and decent friends, my height has a major impact on my life. I could see the way people look at me, many could see me as irrelevant simply because I am short and it pains me. I could be standing in a group and someone who i dont even know would ask me why am i short. for these reasons, sometimes i just prefer to stay to myself and not speak and for as long as I can remember, thats what Ive been doing. The reason why I mention my height in the first place is to try to find the root of all the stuff I am about to write about And why I became the way I became.   
 

in undergrad, I was a good student and got solid grades and for some reason i decided, hey why not be a lawyer, so i busted my ass trying to study for the lsat and put in so many hours that my hair started to fall out and i still ended up getting a 154 after my third try. Then when I got into lawschool, my stress of course increased dramatically. Now i feel disgusted with my lawschool, i feel as though I pay so much and they are in no way of help to me at all. I find the school repulsive and truly i regret my decision of going there. anyways, i sucked it up and got through my first year and ended up with a 2.6 gpa which made my confidence sink more. I was always a straight A student in undergrad and seeing that I got these shit grades even though I put in hours Of work daily, probably more than my classmates, i still ended up with C’s. It was devastating and it continued to just make me hate myself further and expanded my lack confidence and i have been working so much to try and get it up. Now, I am a 3L and i’m almost at the 3.0 mark but of course any law student knows that this isnt enough to get you a nice lawfirm job except a shit government job that pays less than most 4 year degree jobs. That is another reason why i feel so down. Just the fact thst I chose a career hoping after 3 years of absolute trauma, i would get paid good money, but now the only jobs that are willing to accept me are government jobs that pay shitty. i couldve just avoided lawschool and got any degree and got the same pay from other jobs and avoided the hassle.   


Anyways, as I am trying as much as I can to keep up with my 3L year, I am also Trying to keep my mental sanity. My first 2 years of lawschool were horrible, the only thing that really kept me going are two friends that I had. Basically i knew this girl and hung out with her constantly then i lost her. Then the year after that i met another girl, we spoke for a while, hung out almost daily and boom lost her aswell. So i realized that i dont really have friendships but i have free trials. my friendships only seem to last for a year. Basically another reason why im so down  


Now, I am someone that has a lot of deep regret for many things. Some people pick themselves up and move on but I cannot, i dwell on the past, i dwell on my mistakes and i feel disgusted with myself when i make a bad decision or do something thats sinful such as adultery. basically, to cope, i have just been masturbating consistently, i would say i have a masturbation addiction and this lead to me finding prostitution spots. I only ever used the service one time but i sometimes just go there and hold myself back and leave. Now, due to religious beliefs, i know how terribly wrong this stuff is and i have deep regret. i have been fighting so much to try to get myself out of that addiction and to become a better person but i cant do it. i fail not even a few days later. Right now i have nothing. Nobody. I try to speak and my throat literally holds me back, i try to sleep and the shit i think about haunts me in my dreams. I feel ugly, i feel like a weirdo around people now and I feel like I am always negative and give others negative energy with my presence.  I don’t know what to do anymore. I know this all sounds crazy or maybe i am a little dramatic but the feeling i have mentally is fucking me up and theres nothing that i have been able to do about it. My coping mechanism to everything is to go out and try to do anything, just keep my mind busy with something. But that hasnt been working either anymore so i truly dont know what to do. I am just tired and I really hope that one day i can find god again and get better mentally.

1697405729.0,Germaphobia/mysophobia(?) has added a whole new level to my GAD,"This sudden onset of mysophobia(?) has been absolutely wreaking havoc on my (25F) already established and diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder. It began when I became pregnant, thinking back, my husband and I agreed that it seems to have started probably around the first few weeks, long before I even knew I was pregnant (I didn’t find out until I was already almost 3 months along). I am now 7 months postpartum and STILL dealing with this crap! I’m so tired of it! 

As a child i grew up in a very tidy and clean home, as a teen I had what many would call the normal messy room of a teen, and after graduating high school and moving out I never once worried about germs or contamination either, though I did keep my place clean and tidy with maybe a bit more stuff clutter than what I grew up in (expected though, my mother is a minimalist and I’m more of a maximalist, if I had zero self control or care of finances I’d definitely become a hoarder of antiques/trinkets).

What’s odd and confusing to me is the fact that I could cover myself head to toe in mud and be happy as a lark with no issue. I can be around crowds and go to theme parks and go into public bathrooms just as easily as the next person as long as they’re reasonably clean and I wash my hands after. I can walk around our house with my shoes on all day and not be bothered by the thought of germs or contamination. But the world ENDS and my anxiety becomes a controlling issue if the dishes aren’t cleaned with soap, warm water, and are spotless before I or someone else puts them in the dishwasher, for their second washing/decontamination. At the beginning of this I’d Lysol EVERYTHING that I could daily, luckily I don’t do that anymore mainly because I don’t want my son breathing the air particles in. I refuse to drink out of anyone else’s drinks, but it’s only with direct family and my husband, I have no issue taking a sip out of a friends drink. If I’m at someone else’s house or staying in a hotel that is not up to my high cleaning standards, I will find the least dirty place (in my mind) and park my butt there and not move or touch anything else or just stand the entire time (beds are usually not a problem since they’re often perfectly in line with my cleanliness standards in hotels). 

Cleaning wise, my already decently high standards have skyrocketed, if something isn’t done right I have to redo the entire thing. I can go through a whole shelf’s worth of multiple stacks of cups in 2 days because once I finish my drink I HAVE to get a new one even if I just got that cup out say an hour ago and I HAVE to rinse it before using it despite them being cleaned twice before being put up. I cannot use anything like a yeti or anything with reusable straws because despite them looking spotless and are very much clean I will start to physically gag at the thought of the potential of having germs I somehow missed in them. 

There’s definitely other things I do but I have such a bad recall memory, it’s just gotten bad enough that both my husband and my mother have said things recently about my over the top reactions to germs and contamination in certain areas of my life for the past year and a half that weren’t issues previously.

 The ONLY thing that has *always* been a problem in my life has been foods touching on my plate. As a kid I’d get incredibly frustrated and sometimes even have a meltdown if the different things on my plates even slightly touched each other and I’m still that way although it’s not as severe of a reaction, I don’t flip my lid over it anymore if they do end up mixing or touching, at best I get annoyed, at worst I just simply don’t eat it.

If you’ve read this far thanks for reading my vent. I’m currently in therapy for emotional dysregulation due to an untreated insecure-anxious attachment issue. I plan to discuss this with my therapist so that I can hopefully resolve this as well. It’s just so frustrating KNOWING a lot of my issue with this is irrational and doesn’t make sense but having physical reactions makes it so difficult to do exposure therapy with myself.",mentalhealth

And other times my dad will talk on the phone till the next morning (1 or 2 am) as loud as it if we’re midday, laughing and everything and I can’t sleep. If I say something I’ll be told “your not even supposed to sleep here, if you have a problem go to your room” btw for reference I sleep in a Moroccan Salon so it’s not like I’m in his room. Anyways he got mad at my mom saying that you can’t compare him to because I’m the dad while hitting his chest. Idk if this is some ideology problem or ego or something. Or I shouldn’t say anything and be quiet. Kind of hypocrisy on his end tbh.",mentalhealth

i am f20 and i currently have an amazing boyfriend who loves and supports me through my mental problems. i was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue when i was 12. i was severely bullied and sexually assaulted in middle school to the point where i wanted to kill myself. i hated myself so much. i picked out every insecurity and i just ultimately didn’t think i deserved to live. my family life has always been confusing to me. i honestly thought my family was all good and happy and then one day my trauma from my own mother resurfaced.  it’s like i just remembered absolutely everything and it caused me to have an insane panic attack. i didn’t even know i could block out THAT much and that severe when it was still sorta going on. during highschool i went through a bunch of shit too. i won’t go into details of that but i went through a lot. these past 2 years have been all over the place with my mental health. i have gone through the ‘worst time of my life’ a couple times and then a couple weeks later i’ll be fine. i am diagnosed with Bipolar 2 but i’ve tried asking my psych dr about bpd and he doesn’t let me talk so idk. anyway, my mental health has been getting bad again. it’s so fucking stressful. i get irritated at the tiniest things. one small thing and my brain flips into this angry irrational thing. i am very good at controlling what i say and how i react but with my body language, u can tell if i’m upset. i do experience black and white thinking. it sucks. and i’m also so self aware. i think about what i’m doing constantly. when i’m doing anything my thoughts keep going. there is never a quiet moment in my brain. i’m always thinking and it gets bad bc i start to overthink or think irrational things. but that’s the thing. i KNOW i’m being irrational but i can’t help it. i just get angry. and like i said, my bf is super supportive and patient but i’m so scared it’s gonna be too much for him. i have dreams about him breaking up with me or ignoring me so often that when i wake up it feels real. and i can tell lately that my mental health is getting bad again. it’s like,, i will not nor will i ever kill myself- i made a promise to an old friend- but there are times where i just don’t feel like i have a purpose. like i’m just existing. i am not LIVING. i am just going through life. it could be also that i’m stressing with college and money and jobs and friends and stuff but my brain is jst too much. i want a break from it so fkn bad. but i’m stuck with it obviously. i am just not looking forward to living a life being on meds forever and still not enjoying life. i don’t even enjoy who i am. i don’t even know who i am. i look in the mirror and just see someone staring back at me. i have no perception of myself. i don’t know how anyone perceives me. it freaks me out. i don’t like not even recognizing who i am. but in the moment when i’m looking at ‘myself’ i don’t feel sad for not knowing who that is. my brain just goes blank when i look at me. like it’s just a missing piece of a puzzle that’s been lost for years and only recently did i realize it was missing",mentalhealth

I thought this email would be easy but I'm oddly nervous. I'm the one paying for the service so I feel like I shouldn't have to apologize for myself or explain myself too much. This is what I have as of now. Is ""it is a good fit"" better than ""we are a good fit""? Ugh this is so awkward. This therapist has left me feeling hurt, stressed and misunderstood quite a few times. I just want to move on. I also really don't want to have another conversation with her about this because I can tell that she knows it's not a good fit either. We only had 5 sessions .I've tried to communicate my hurts to her and she would get defensive. Things would just get tense and awkward. I just don't like the way she steers the conversations. I feel like the things she says to me are not helpful. I'd rather end things now before more stress and conflict comes up

1697409258.0,Needing some advice on my feelings,"Hi all, 

I am looking for some general advice if possible. I (23F) have been experience periods of low mood in waves for the last 6 months. Over the past 2 years, I have had spells of feeling low. Sometimes it is triggered by life events such as changing jobs or leaving university. However, other times I just wake up with a bad case of what I call “the gloom”. 

On days like this, I am very negative and irritable. I almost find comfort in complaining about things and I don’t have any motivation to do things. I might feel completed disinterested in day to day life. My energy levels are at rock bottom during these bouts as well. During these times, I only want to curl up and stay in bed and I feel like quitting my job etc. I am lucky enough to have a good support system around me but I know I’m not a nice person to be around when my mood is affected in this way. 

In the past, I just tried to push through these feelings or I would blame it on some kind of SAD since I used to experience worse emotions during winter. But since meeting my partner (21M), I have been thinking differently about things. He is a healthcare professional and has had serious discussions with me about my displaying potential symptoms of anxiety and depression. I spoke to my doctor and they gave me a course of online counselling but I didn’t find it useful as I found it difficult to engage with the online format. I have been going to a therapist for a few months too. But there are still days where I wake up and feel the gloom. 

We’ve had discussions about how I should really try to block out the negative thoughts and think more positively. Whilst I try to do this, it doesn’t always help. I have been thinking about anti-depressants but that feels like a big step for me. 

I understand that I am still quite young and maybe this is just something that happens at the beginning of adulthood or maybe I need to get a grip. 

Does this sound like depression? Does any of this sound familiar? What can I do to be more positive?

P.S. I don’t find breathing exercises helpful and things like gratitude lists don’t really help me when I feel low.",mentalhealth

First time posting here. I hope everyone is feeling well. 
I have a question and I'd like your opinions and see if there's anyone dealing with this. 
When I watch a movie or a tv show, I'll tend to be very sensible to the plot and will feel the emotion for the rest of the day or sometimes longer. If the main character is sad, I'll be sad for a time. If the main character is this guy with no emotion or a creep, I'll have no emotion and feel weird and think like the character. It works also with people around me.

the reason I've failed as a son, as a friend and as a student is my insecurity and hate for myself, because of that I also lied to my friends about I I was for about 3 years before they decided to give up on me, since then I did make new friends and I swore to never lie again but that feeling of hate became stronger and stronger every day till it became a constant scream inside my head, one day i was drunk (I'm Italian, here the legal age to drink is 18) and talked about it with my firends , they were supportive and understanding witch made me feel really guilty about it, i don't kniw why but telling people how i feel just makes me feel like a oiece of garbage, like i don't deserve any love or help, I've tried many times to help others and it makes me feel good but also bad because I'm happy that I can helo but I feel like it's an excuse for me to feel better about myself like ""oh, i helped them, that must mean I'm a good person""
at the start of the month I started going to a few festivities in a few towns in my region (notti bianche, cortes apertas) so for three days I only got drunk and smoked weed, after that I thought I was starting to feel better, the screaming suddenly stopped for the whole month and still haven't returned but I knew that something was wrong
last week I started having episodes where if I laughed or smiled my muscles started twitching and I startes going insane, i often punch the wall to relieve that feeling but it's starting to get worse, it's a strange feeling, my muscles start hardening and twitching and I can't control them anymore, before it was just by smiling or laughing but now it happens randomly, I figured that probably that feeling I had that there was something wrong was because I was maybe bottling everything up unconsciously or something and if it is like that I have to let those feelings out but I don't know how to do that and it's a problem because these episodes are getting more violent every time, I'm trying to control these episodes because at this point every time I have one I feel the need to hurt myself to relieve that feeling

In cooking class I find it difficult to understand the recipes and the materials we are given to read and understand. I had trouble understanding texts as a child, and I still have trouble with it. Even in my language. While my class was cooking, everyone except me seemed to understand what they had to do. Since I didn't understand everything, I asked my cooking teacher for help. She came to me and told me to read the paper she had given me earlier because there were explanations on how to properly prepare a salad. I read the first introduction but still couldn't understand it. So I grabbed my recipe and read it over and over again. Still no. I cried and left class because of it. My cooking teacher was worried and followed me asking what was wrong because I couldn't understand everything on the recipe. She asked if I was overwhelmed and I answered yes. She then said that I could help decorate the tables and that I could bring the unfinished salad I needed to make,to her table and I said ok. My cooking teacher also meant if there is anything, I can ask her. When decorating the tables, a plate was missing. So I said that a plate was missing and she said in an irritating tone, ""I told you before,the plates are in this cabinet!."" And of course I got upset.So when I was finished with the tables,I thought I was done because my teacher didn't say anything after this. I went to a different room and grabbed my phone to vent to my best friend and to text my professional companion about my internship. I wanted to cancel my internship appointment because it was on the exact day and because I felt depressed and needed a day off. Then my cooking teacher chaught me and said ""Can you put your phone away? Phones in the kitchen are not allowed!"" And I answered:""Sorry I was texting my professional companion for my internship"" and she meant: ""This has nothing to do with your internship!Everyone is working and giving their best but you arent doing anything!""
I got really upset and cried again. She didn't yell but she sounded angry. Like sorry I thought I was allowed to use my phone for a second. I absolutely don't like her and I have her for 2 years.

My awareness was so blurred I couldn’t notice if someone was talking to me right infront of me. I’ve lost interest in the things I loved I couldn’t focus on it it was so bad. 
And my memory was terribly I had gotten so bad I had gotten a job at a fast food restaurant I had to quit because couldn’t remember anything anyone told me or the things on the menu I couldn’t answer questions because I couldn’t remember ya know the answers. And school was worse. 
I felt weak and tired I would sleep all night and go back to sleep after an hour. I would sleep all night go to school sleep through atleast 2 classes then I’d be tired and sleep all day when I got home And my body overall felt so weak anything would make me tired. I thought I was losing my mind and it got worse over time I was like a zombie it was terrible.
 I thought maybe this is depression but I didn’t feel depressed I was never sad or suicidal. I went to a doctor a few times I was told anxiety or adhd and took meds for it but it didn’t help me and the doctor thought it was a mental thing but it wasn’t. I thought I was actually crazy or this is just how everyone actually lived. I posted one here a few times to get advice but I never got much help.
But I finally decided I’ll get my blood work done I tested everything everthing was perfect except my vitamin D levels. For someone my age it should be around 50-100 mine was at 10 it was really deficient. And sure enough when I looked up the symptoms for a vitamin D deficiency and they were right on the mark. I didn’t realize ever sense lockdowns I wouldn’t really go outside I’ve gotten indoors hobbies and where I live when it’s either really hot or really cold no in between it was hard to go outside. I didn’t realize I never really did. 
I’ve never been so relieved I’ve actually found the problem I can’t believe it was something so simple as that. I have medication for the next few months and after one a few weeks my mind is actually starting to clear little by little.
 I just kinda really wanted to write all this out incase there are other people with the same symptoms as me and are think the wrong thing or getting misdiagnosed because it’s so easy to go to the doctor say my head feels weird and get aderall or antidepressants.I never would have thought this was the reason.

i really want to >!hurt myself!<. i know this is such a stupid thing to do it over, and its so wrong but ive been so hurt and confused. im really sorry, im not sure how to do this. i literally made an account and wrote this as everyone is asleep and i cant stop crying.  
my bf broke up with me but im so pissed off. im the type to be really clingy and i imagine things that arent real and i believe them. so i run to him and beg him not to leave me. i completely understand that i am a lot to deal with. id do things for his attention too, i really didnt mean to be toxic and i promised him im getting better. he helped me alot and stopped me from hurting myself and talking to weird people and a lot more. the problem is that i met him online which makes me a nasty edater.. i am not proud of the shit ive done. i ask god to forgive me all the time. i know ive done some really shitty things to him like being toxic, but i made sure he felt loved all the time and also tried to help him. im even learning dutch for this guy man. its not too bad though as i like learning languages so it wasnt a huge waste of my time ig. but still.  
  
anyway then my parents found out about my exes and what they've wanted me to do. they didnt want me to use social media, so i couldnt talk to my bf for days and it was really hard. i found a way to speak to him again.  
  
the past month hes just been weird. im not sure how to explain but my past relationships have turned out a similar way too and it must be because of me. i tried to work it out but i had no idea.. he didnt really say he loved me anymore. he didnt want to do anything with me and he didnt really support me emotionally. i completely understand that he has a life, wants space and also wants to be supported emotionally but he didnt tell me anything anymore. i told him all the time, i promise i wont force you to tell me anything but i am always here for you. because he was different, i would worry all the time does he hate me is he cheating im so replaceable. there are so many cute and mentally stable girls. would have nightmares and i would get so worried. before my parents found out, he didnt change at all so maybe its to do with that. he wasnt super mean, sometimes he would kind of be like how he used to be but then id just get a different vibe. i think maybe because of what we were using to speak, we couldnt do anything but msg and call but it was risky to call a lot. so that vibe continued and then i sent a uhh picture to him (i am really not allowed to do that and i wanted to show how much i love him) and he was like i love you. so i thought it must be that, he misses it.  
  
after i was able to use instagram so i said we can talk there and he was okay for a bit and then he was weird again. i would send more pictures and yea he was really nice and it was sweet but idk something was still off. a few days ago he seemed really annoyed or something. i wanted to make conversation and he was just clearly pissed off. i said ""im really sorry, are you mad at me ? please dont be mad at me. i just love you"" blah blah and complimented him or smth. and then i said gn and all he said was gn, so i said oh okay. i was really confused because after he was like ""okay im just going to say it. something happened to me and ive been scared to death. ive cried about 3 times this evening. just let me... be happy i reply"". are you fucking joking. im not mad something happened to him, im so sorry the way he worded t sounded like he was traumatised. i felt so bad but i was burning up. i didnt say bad things but i said we need space so you can work this out and be normal again. i was so fucking mad because he knows how much ive been worrying for a few months and hes just now telling me this ? ive said to him so many times, im so sorry that im really overwhelming as a person and my emotions. im so sorry you have to deal with this, im really trying to get better (i actually was trying).

today has been the worst fucking day. i gave him space for two days and yesterday he messaged and i said if i could ask him smth. i said can you tell me when you feel like this.. and basically what i said about my exams but less angry and dw i have more mocks !! <3 + i hope hes okay. he said hes not okay but im not the problem. i asked if he wants to talk abt it and he said no so i said we need more space then. i really wanted to know what happened but my fucking head keeps thinking what if hes saying this to get rid of you. i just couldnt let me thoughts win. imagine something did happen and i accused him of that ? fuck. i didnt. he just kept saying im not the problem and i forgot what i said tbh but he said lol and said smth abt my pfp or idk T\^T. i just put ... and yea thats funny isnt it and then i said i dont care what happened, just get fucking help. i wish i didnt say that, now it looks like i never cared about him and that id never be there for him. he said dont email me, i think we have to stop this. why the fuckkk ?? i tried to break up with him multiple times before (maybe sometimes for his attention i know its really terrible but he knew i didnt mean it) and i tried to a few weeks ago but i meant it. i really couldnt deal with having a relationship then, and he took ages to reply and he just said ggive me ur insta quickly. so i cant break up with him but he can with me. i wish hed fucking say he didnt want to be with me then. i saidhis name and asked why the fuck didnt you say this before. he said i really appreciate your love youve given me but we cant do this or idk i forgot. i said i hate you, fine just leave and fuck off, then i blocked him. wish id never spoken to anyone online.  
  
(i literally unblocked him like 5 mins after cos what if he changes his mind in the future)  
  
im so childish i just hate myself. i self sabotage all the time. id never have started being obsessed having relationships if i didnt say yes to the first guy i spoke to. he literally ruined me. and i kept meeting weird people until i met my bf who just left. please dont see him as the bad guy, he is the most respectful guy ever and he is the sweetest thing. i just wish i was older or i wasnt so weird and got attached to people. i think my teddy is him and i get really sad when i cant go places with it. im 15 its so embarrassing. everything about my personality is. i NEVER was emotional or liked telling people them. i was never attention seeking and i wasnt a stupid fucking slut. i used to like my body, not hurt myself, not think looking like a skeleton was beautiful. the internet made me fucking awful. i honestly wish i never ever used social media the way i did. maybe even use it at all.  
  
i just want to know, am i crazy for being upset ? i do not want to self diagnose at all or be attention seeking but i think i have relationship anxiety because me worrying about our relationship is all i thought about. even when we were amazing, there is a part of me that says he doesnt love you really. im pretty sure everyone thinks this about their first couple of relationships. ive told him sometimes when its gotten really bad and he tries to distract me. so he does recognise that i worry.. im sorry for being dramatic. i cant grow up or learn from my mistakes. i cant fucking move on. i wrote something for him if we broke up but i accidentally deleted it and i already told him to fuck off so i cant send it. its basically about what ive learnt from him, what im going to stop doing as a person (being toxic, needy, selfish), what kind of girl i hope he finds and that i still love him and ill always be loyal to him. i most likely will move on but i just cant imagine that right now. i know it takes time but i want to only be for him and no one else. no one else is going to love me the same. i really love him so much that if he wants to be happy with someone else, ill let him of course ! but why wouldnt he tell me that. he always told me if i left id tell you, and he did. but why wouldnt he tell me that. it hurts me so fucking much, he clearly doesnt love me enough to tell me that he will be happy with someone else. he tells me its because idk. he didnt say specifically bc of what happened to him. i have no clue. i deleted the chat. i just shouldnt care anymore but i do care. its been so hard to give him space already now i have to forever ! fuck i cant i really want to do silly things, but this time he wont be here to stop me. i miss him. i miss how he would look after me. im sorry for being selfish.  
  
also with god.. i was so scared of losing him recently as he said he needs time to think about things so i gave him space and prayed all night reading certain pages and saying specific duas. i also had an exam the next day so yayy. he actually did come back and i tried to pray more but i got out of it and i regret it so much. not purely bc i lost him but bc we should pray for god because we want to. he isnt some genie . you have to work hard and have strong faith to ask him for things. so i guess in a way i asked for him to break up with me. im going to try hard with god though and not focus on boys too much until im like 18. i need to revise a lot too and i suck lmao. i hope he has an amazing future and marries a woman so beautiful that looking at her makes you feel so happy.  
  
im so sorry to vent like this. literally it doesnt make sense grammatically and i repeat loads of things like he said, i said, really. i have no idea how this works on here. im really sorry if its annoying or doesnt fit this group idk. i know people have it so much worse, they are dying in wars and i ask allah sometimes to help everyone suffering. i already feel a little better for writing my feelings down. my friends are tired of me being upset over this guy all the time so once again ive turned to the internet. ill mark this as nsfw just in case as this might be triggering (i dont understand tw but i put them so no one will shout at me :) )  
  
thanks for taking the time to read this embarrassing sob story. im asking to get bullied icl but ehh. i hope youre all doing amazing and if not, ill pray for you. please be safe. you can always vent to me <3",mentalhealth

1697403546.0,I’ve been so angry lately,"I’m f27 and I have diagnosed depression and anxiety along with a very chaotic childhood. I grew up watching my mom scream and blow up over the most ridiculous things. She often directed her anger at whoever was in the room even if you did nothing. I distinctly remember being around 7, looking at my mom during a screaming fit, and being utterly disgusted. I never wanted to be like her. 

Usually when I’m angry at people I try to communicate and avoid yelling. I rarely show my anger to other people. 
Really the only person I feel “comfortable” being mad at is my partner, because I’m not afraid that he would leave or be angry at me for standing up for myself. When I argue with him I do not feel out of control. We are respectful to each other even when angry. 

But then recently I’ve been yelling at my dog, and the cats. They are just being animals but I get so mad at them and chased them away from stuff they shouldn’t touch or mess with.
I have sometimes had a tendency to be violent when I am alone. 

When I was little this only happened a couple times, I ripped the head of my stuffed animal off and smashed a set of Christmas ornaments that had been given to me. I wasn’t angry at the objects, just angry. This was done alone and no one ever knew.
Now as an adult, I’ll break stuff (only my stuff), throw things, yell, scream, and angrily mutter and rant to myself. I was putting away groceries and was so infuriated that the onion I had wouldn’t stop rolling, finally it rolled to  behind the fridge and I had to get a broom to get it out. I grabbed the broom angrily, cussing and yelling about how stupid this is. 
Around others I am mild mannered, quiet, and patient. Alone? I feel like I’m becoming my mom.

There’s also the fact that my pets do see my aggression and they act scared. I’ve never hurt them or hit them. I never would. I don’t want them to be afraid of me. I want everyone to feel safe with me, but I don’t even feel safe with me.",mentalhealth

Beginning. Back in 2017 i had an accident that caused me to go down south mentally. Im talkin hallucinations visually, auditorily, i couldnt remember anything. It was chaos.  Over the next 2 years i didnt take my treatment seriously. I ended up over dosing purposely in december 2019. After that i sought out treatment and took it serious. During treatment, i learned about my diagnosis on the mental health scale. Adhd, manic bipolar 1, mentally delusional, ocd, ptsd, and possibly on the high functioning spectrum. After 2 years of treatment, i stopped. One of my drs told me i was above her pay grade. Only 1 person during my treatment, was caring, told me like it was, and actually helped me the way i needed to be helped. We did alot of work and got alot done. So to the main point. With my diagnosis some of the side effects that i live with, are constant anxiety, the ptsd keeps me stuck in memories and deep traumatic thoughts. I cant shake it off, it wont stop, i feel like no one understands. I feel like no one understands. I stim night and day, when my wife touches me my body just shocks and i get scared and i cannot figure out why.

I am an autistic woman and I'm fairly independent, but a recent life occurrence has really crippled me with horrific depression. Mentally, I am the worst I have ever been; I've fallen back into bad shape and struggle to take care of myself on any level. 

When sharing my problems or feelings with those close to me, I feel unable to adequately tell them what exactly I need. I say that I want people to just listen to what I'm saying, but I also have been upset when people don't argue against certain things I say, such as disparaging comments against myself or negative assumptions. I'm also aware that I have damaged my own things, hurt myself privately, and removed my personal items from common spaces to convey that I'm upset and am doing poorly. Of course, no one really knows how to approach me when I scratch my face out of photos or put hurtful notes about myself in my room, but I often feel frustrated because I feel alone and like showing my suffering doesn't make people help me.

I'm not very good at being consistent or clear with how I would like to be helped- any advice on how best to communicate my emotional needs? What do people suggest to say to others when they are seeking mental health help from friends and family?

1697411846.0,"Its Probably Messed Up, But I Love Proving People Wrong When They Judge Me","I'm pretty depressed and a bit bipolar as well, and I recently had experience with an acquaintance that weirdly satisfied me. 

I generally don't impress people on my first introduction. I can see it with pretty much everyone I meet. They give me an odd look and often just ignore me if they can. I'm a very ignorable person. I've figured out, and kinda confirmed by some friends that I have a very flat affect and I think most people find it awkward or just unappealing. I have resting bitch face, ok lol. 

I'm also a very hard nut to crack. I don't give too much away because I've been fucked several times leading to a suspension at school and even an arrest once. In both situations I was framed by someone else. So yeah people generally treat me like shit, and I think that's a default for many others these days, too. 

So if you wanna get to know me, it's gonna take some time. I don't share nearly anything personal at work. When I do, I surprise people because they judge me one way, and then I show them that I have another side to me. Even teammates I've known for four years sound surprised when I share certain things. 

The weird part is that get a kick out of this. I love slowly proving someone wrong when I know they think they've pinned me down. 

So the situation that made me realize all this was something that happened recently with a friend's wife. Now, we've never been that close. We do the normal chit chat when we see each other and thats it. But at a wedding last weekend, we were put in a few situations where we were kinda forced to talk one on one for a long period of time and she actually got to know me. There was one specific comment I made that apparently had an impact on her because the next day she said that she had been thinking about it a lot and then said she appreciated having me in her life.

Now I know what you're thinking. I'm being sketchy  with my friends wife, but that's really not it. It's just a self esteem thing for me. Over time, I've closed my shell so much that I think my reserved attitude is justified, but it's not. I genuinely love proving people wrong because I think everyone doesn't like me, so when they show signs of liking me it's just am affirmation for me to gain some confidence. 

After thinking about all this, I realize that this pattern is bad, and I gotta just open up more to people. I hate it because people genuinely suck, but there's a middle ground. I know I have a good side to me and people enjoy seeing it. 

So really, I'm just writing this as a way to process it all and be better about how I interact with others.",mentalhealth
1697397914.0,I was complimented today on reddit,"All my life everyone hated me for my face and said I looked like mother gothel. But today I finally got enough courage to post my face on reddit. Immediately a minute after I posted, I was called cute by a commenter. This made my entire day NO it made my entire year. I am not mother gothel anymore I am Rapunzel herself. 

All my life my mom shamed me for not being white skinned or blonde or having blue eyes. But beauty isn't even in the coloring of someone. Plus tan skin is very desert rose aesthetic, brown eyes are like chocolate and my black coarse hair is like an award winning horse's mane which are notorious for being hard to brush. 

I think a big part of why I was always bothered by not being pretty like other girls is because of my religion. Beauty is a huge part of islam in various facets. First of all, all the prophets in Islam were described to be the most handsome men of their time with Prophet Yusuf (as) being said to have godly beauty. 

Second of all, women in Islam are told to cover up their entire bodies except for their hands, feet and face to protect their beauty from the harmful gaze of men. Some sheikhs even think that women should cover their face. I felt like this never applied to me because I have a very ugly face and hideous hair so what would be the point of covering it up? It would be like a pig wearing lipstick, a girl who looks pathetic and dumb for thinking that anyone would look at her. I felt excluded, if every woman was so gorgeous she had to cover herself up then why didn't the same apply to me? This is why I did not wear hijab even though my mom beat me up to try to get me to wear hijab but I was stubborn and refused to wear hijab. However now that I see my beauty, I know it must be covered and I will start wearing the hijab from now on. 

Third of all, Prophet Mohamed (pbuh) really cared about beauty. He would often make remarks about who the most beautiful slave girls are in his hadiths. He even married Maria who was a coptic slave because she was so beautiful. This made me feel bad and made me feel like my own prophet would not like me if he saw my face. The other thing that made me upset and made me question my faith is the prophet's treatment of his first wife Khadijah (ra) compared to one of his later wives Aisha (ra). Khadijah was Islam's first convert and she was a loving wife to the prophet for decades and was a successful businesswoman and probably handled the finances of the household before the prophet actually became the prophet. Basically, Khadijah was pretty much the perfect wife to the prophet. However, when the prophet was asked who is his favorite person in the world, he said it was Aisha who he was only married to for a few years. I thought this was a case of lookism because when Khadijah died, she was described to be very old and haggered while Mohamed always made comments about how beautiful and cute Aisha was even though she was only 6 when he married her. This made me feel bad because I thought that no matter how kind I am to a man or any person for that matter, they will only care about beauty in the end. I also began to compare myself to Aisha, I wondered to myself, how could a 6 year old be so much more beautiful than me?

Now I know all of these things were stupid delusions from me.

I don't know how to explain it but I feel like a real girl now. I feel like if this was Ottoman Empire times and I was a slave at a slave auction, the king would take one look at me and fall in love with me and would immediately buy me to give me freedom and so I can be his wife. I'm not saying I have the beauty of a princess or anything like that, I still know that I am objectively ugly however I now see that there is more merit in my beauty, I think I have a kind face that a king would fall in love with. In fact I think many ugly people usually have kinder faces. 

Also another fantasy of mine since I'm Palestinian is that the IDF will look at my beautiful face and immediately put down their weapons, stop the fighting and give back Palestine their land. However this will always be just a fantasy since I am stuck in the UK.

A stone heart like mine just passed like a kidney stone. In pursuit of amorous beauty for which I will be armored in love, looking back, I seek now a return to normalcy. Beauty is safe for all who is in need of it but no soul was born without it. What was I doing all my life? Every time I looked at my face in the mirror and hated it, it is equivalent to taking 7 spoonfuls of Psilocybin that I scarred my hands with by crushing it to powder myself. I think I am beautiful and I think the moral of the story is that there is someone out there who finds you cute.",mentalhealth
1697411438.0,How to stop triggering from trauma in a relationship.,"Long story short, I've been dating this guy for years, and we had a really toxic relationship in the past. I initiated no contact, and he's currently in rehab for alcohol abuse. I won't dive into the debate about whether people can change; this post is about me. So, he's genuinely making an effort to change, and he has recognized and apologized for all the harm he caused me (no physical abuse or controlling or anything like that, but things like flirting with other women and gaslighting me when I got upset). We are not in a relationship right now; I'm just trying to get to know this new version of him and work on forgiving.

The issue is that he's been doing well, respecting the boundaries I've set, and so on. However, when I see even the slightest thing that reminds me of a past situation where he hurt me, even if it's not related at all, I get triggered and become upset. I end up saying passive-aggressive things, making it seem like I'm not doing my part. I don't know how to change this because I want to stop feeling this way and stop punishing this guy I care about for all the shit that happened before.
I just made a super toxic comment and then apologized for my attitude.

Yes, I have been to therapy and am currently in therapy, which has helped with my self-esteem, but it hasn't been as effective in helping me let go of this trauma.

1697397745.0,How can I get over my hatred of my old roommate?,"A little over a month ago, I managed to get away from an abusive roommate. She's locked me out of the apartment twice, she screamed at me multiple times, would exploit our leaseholder - subtenant relationship to get her way, punched my car and put a dent in the fender and has even hit me (that's not even all of it). Being that I'm a man I put up with A LOT because I knew if I fought back all it would take is one call to the cops and I'd get locked up (which is also the reason I never called them myself). 

My issue is I'm trying to move on but sometimes those memories will play back in my head and I'll get fueled with rage remembering how she treated me. Part of me wants to drive back to her apartment and get revenge but I manage to suppress those thoughts.

1697396994.0,"Hurting so badly today,","I’m not doing well. My mental health is the lowest it has ever been by far. 

I want to get better but I have few challenges to get over first. It’s not easy for me to be open to therapists. I feel very judged and seen in the presence of professionals. I’m working on getting better at this. I’m staying on a consistent medication routine, but that doesn’t solve the entire puzzle. I can’t imagine better medication than what I have, so this leads me to believe that behavioral modification or life circumstances are my biggest road blocks, but I honestly couldn’t say with absolute certainty.

I rarely think that I do anything right. Most of my life feels like a series of increasingly painful mistakes like cracking glass on the surface of a mirror. I don’t need more help seeing where the damage is. I cut my hands examining it. It spreads.

I try not to over share with others, but I just can’t seem to stop doing it. I find that I hate myself a lot. I very seldom get to use my education, content creation skill sets, or musical gifts. The older I get, the less opportunity I find to do what I love. It seems that life in America is set up so that we work, pay our bills, and die. This is compounded by the stress of human relationships which in my experience are rarely if ever helpful. I anticipate that people will hurt me badly.  The news is heavy. I wait for war to reach our small town neighborhoods and live in constant fear. I worry about others and feel the pain of people far too easily. I carry it all the time. It’s so heavy.

Lately, nothing is satisfying. This makes me feel like my arms are tied down and handcuffed to concrete pillars. I push and pull but remain trapped. I frequently think about death.

I would like to leave social media but I don’t know how. I have friends who don’t have a phone. I don’t know how to keep my network of support while also being removed from things that dishearten me.

My wife and I owned a toy store for a few months. Our business partners took it from us and rebranded. I’m heartbroken about it and I don’t know where to turn.

It seems that many people have expectations for me. I feel that I am expected to share my hobbies in a small business format. Lately, I’m frequently confronted with the utter heartbreak of losing so much so often. I feel an expectation to show up, but my bed is like an anvil and rather than being on top of it, I am underneath it.

So many people tell me to rest while others say that “idle hands are the devil’s workshop.” Others tell me to take business opportunities as they become available while I struggle to pay our bills. It seems that it is best for me to ask “how high?” as others tell me to jump. I don’t remember what it means to do something for myself. There is always some sort of motivation to please someone else underneath it all.

I tried to be a leader. I gave it my best, but I couldn’t succeed. I let everyone down and now my face hurts from crying. Every day is more painful than the last and these compounding decades of struggle have left me feeling like Mac Miller.

Good news, good news, good news 
That's all they wanna hear 
No, they don't like it when I'm down 
But when I'm flying
It make 'em so uncomfortable 
So different, what's the difference?

When it ain't that bad 
It could always be worse 
I'm running out of gas
Hardly anything left 
Hope I make it home from work 
So tired of being so tired

Why I gotta build something beautiful just to go set it on fire? I'm no liar but 
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth. Maybe 'cause it ain't. I just love the way it sound when I say it, yeah.

So what I do? If you know me it ain't anything new. Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while, but I heard that the sky is still blue. Heard they don't talk about me no more.

1697409586.0,I’m recovering from a self inflicted injury that resulted in me being hospitalized. I’m learning more and more how this spawns from self hatred but I can’t fathom caring for myself. What can I do?,"I recently moved to college and saw a drastic increase of feelings of loneliness and self hatred since I came here. I’ve been in therapy all throughout my high school life and mental health is something I’ve long worked to improve in my life. I know I hate myself and I have for a long time but I don’t know how to avoid this part of myself that’s always so critical of everything that I do. I constantly feel like a failure and that I need to be better and I recently hit a low point when I self harmed in my dorm room while I was alone. I didn’t intend on suicide or anything of the sort I just felt I deserved it after a recent incident involving a friend. I ended up having to get stitches and my parents came to visit me and have now told me that they not only believed what I had done was an attempt at suicide but also that they were afraid for me to be left alone after the fact and they considered admitting me that same night. Fortunately my parents held out faith when I told them I would be ok and let life return to normal but now I’m left so lost. I can’t wrap my head around how bad that incident should be, almost as if even though it got that bad it still was deserved. Everyone I’ve talked to tells me to be kinder to myself and to try to ignore that voice that hurts me so much but I can’t. I almost don’t want to. I worry I’ll become a worse, more selfish person if I do. I also feel like I’m still not deserving of a kinder voice. I used to be able to escape to my friends for some sort of validation or self worth but now I’m in college alone an unable to run from this feeling that I’m not good enough. What do I do? What can I do? I can’t worry my parents like that again. 

Some background if you need it: I come from a family of divorced parents and 3 sisters. My parents divorced when I was 5 and I had to move schools around the age of 10 when my mom remarried. I always had a bad relationship with my step dad as I felt he hated me and loved my sisters, it’s been proven by others and conversations with him since that time that this did happen to be the case though he didn’t intend to make me feel that way he acknowledged that he made a mistake. I’m homosexual and this is what I primarily think causes a lot of my self hatred. I believe I’m bisexual but I’m not sure if that’s because I don’t want to be fully gay or if there is actually some attraction to women. I feel disgust and hatred for that part of me, just wanting to be like my friends who are all straight. It’s also caused friction in a lot of relationships in the past which left me feeling as if that had I not been gay my life would be better.

These things seem like random things to mention but they’re the things I (and my therapist) think most likely might link back to why I hate myself.",mentalhealth

1697406559.0,SSRI feelings,"I've been taking SSRIs for a year and a half. I had a major depressive episode, the worst one yet, but have had several throughout my life. I've had issues with SH, suicidal thoughts and ideation, and have had attempts in the past. I also had major anxiety, which was causing the most problems for me if I'm honest. I was pretty used to being depressed at this point.

When I first took antidepressants this time round, Sertraline, at the time, I could feel this warm heat radiate up from my stomach and envelop me. It was bizarre. I then felt nauseous and had a panic attack. The first few weeks were rocky, but the side effects went away. No effect on my mood though, upped my dose and, with therapy too, started to feel good. I was getting awful diarrhea and put up with it for a month because I felt like I was finally getting better and didn't want them to change anything. They changed me over to escitalopram, which worked better - no side effects. 

This takes me up to now, where I feel OK and keep forgetting to take my meds. I have tried alarms, associating them with parts of the day etc. but I'm a parent and work full time in an extremely busy job and I will turn off my alarm and think ""right, when I have finished X I will take it"" and I forget. I will take solidly for a few days, miss a day, take for a week, miss a few days... and it goes like that. 

Now when I take it, I feel that warmth radiate throughout me. I almost feel high. No confusion, dizziness, racing heart rate or anything worrying, but it feels like a shield I have put up. Like I am encased in a bubble. I took it just now - remembered because I was stressed - and I felt better in seconds. 

Could this just be a placebo, or do I just not need it anymore? I plan to speak to my doctor, but again, I'm extremely busy. I've been thinking about coming off them, but its recommended for 2 years after recovery and I'm not there yet. I'm also worried about anxiety because although I'm no longer depressed or massively anxious, I don't cope well with normal anxiety. 

Has anyone had any of these feelings? Not sure if they are in any way normal?",mentalhealth
1697392693.0,"My Sister has been depressed for 4 years, we tried everything.","To give a little background, my sister was fresh out of college, my father wanted her to do a government job but she wanted private job. my father basically forced her to not take some low paying private job and prepare for government job. she failed numerous times and it was taking toll on her mental health, so I advised her to stop trying after 2 years. now for 2 years she has been doing some private jobs, she has changed numerous job until now and she didn't like any of them.

She went through few depression stages along the way.

1. Initially she blamed my father ( rightfully so ) for her condition because he did not let her take that private job. at this stage I also supported my father stating that he was only looking for her well being. ( My greatest sin )
2. Then she again started preparing for government job, but she again did not crack it, and then every time result came for the exam, she would cry for a month.
3. Then came private job phase, where she would do some private jobs, but she constantly felt like she was not good enough, she does not know anything about job.
4. Now she is severally depressed, she thinks she is bothersome to everyone, she constantly says that ""I don't like anything"". she does not speak with anyone. she cries a lot thinking about the old failures. she has completely lost her decision making capabilities, where she does not make any decision and replies with every question as ""I don't know"".

We recently found a job for her again ( she left last one because we wanted to give her some breather before she started again ). and she got the job easily. but the moment she got the job she is crying, saying that ""she does not feel ready"". but if she does not do a job, most certainly, she will sit in home all alone all the time, thinking depressed thoughts and her condition will not improve.

We tried talking to some therapist, after few sessions therapist suggested some medicines which she refuses to take. and now she does not see therapist as well.

We don't know what to do. My elder sister ( we are three siblings - the one I am talking about is middle child, I am the youngest ) spends hours talking to her trying to reason with her but all vain.

Please help me with some options to how to deal with this situation. we tried everything, from giving her motivation, listening to her ( she does not say anything unless you basically force her ), therapy, giving her option to do the job or not. she just sits in a corner and keeps crying. 

In our culture it is not necessary for her to work at all, infact we do not need her to work. but when presented with that option she also feels like a failure, as every other family member does have some kind of job. but she also does not want the stress of the job, she says "" I don't want to learn anything new"", and ""I know I won't be able to do anything"".

It is taking toll on us as well, my elder sister basically sacrifices her career whole day talking to her, I try to comfort her as much as possible but after 4 years we are running out of stuff to say. we don't know what to do.

1697405754.0,Do I have ADHD (inattentive) or am I just lazy,"I’m in my early twenties and was aware of ADHD for a long time, but had never considered the possibly of having it. I think I have noticed some symptoms in the past such as carelessness, low attention span, etc. But am not sure if it’s attributable to my previous diagnoses of depression/anxiety.

My reasons that I think I have it:

Recently I lost my job ( of 2 years ) because I had made constant small careless mistakes, for tasks involving looking at large spreadsheets and grammar. Since the start of the job I had constant anxiety about getting fired, having imposter syndrome and making small mistakes. I made small mistakes but I masked it (mostly) by working extra hours, and still made mistakes.

I started another job in a warehouse, handling important documents, with strict procedures, but I still couldn’t manage to get it right, despite being told multiple times. And had anxiety about counting paper numbers wrong, and despite trying my best got my counts wrong multiple times. I was also given specific instructions to keep my eye on boxes but i wandered off multiple times.

In university for the past couple of years I have barely ever watched more than 5-10 minutes of each lecture , and find myself just scrolling through the slides, and copying and pasting them into my notes. During in person lectures or and especially watching movies if not interested I tend to doze off, then wake up missing most of the content. I’m completely fine in classes where there are topics that involve conversation and social interaction.

Just in general instruction that I’m told goes over my head, I’ll hear about a quarter of what is being told to me, and I’ll try to piece the rest together, or ask again. Often I’ll have to write down instructions to remember them, but even then I’ll go off track, if I find them to be monotous and half complete the tasks , leave and come back, do some work , procrastinate until the night.

It genuinely feels like i am a slow learner, I when it comes to new processes, and concepts. It feels so draining to learn things , but still mess them up.

My reasons for no having it

I am genuinely engaged when it comes to interacting people,friends, strangers etc it seems like everything about me switches on, the social awareness, emotional intelligence and curiosity. I have no problem remembering minor details about people or places I can have a back and forth individual or group conversation for hours, and be patient with my turn to ask questions and show people that I am paying attention. It seems l can focus on conversation easily, while being aware of what’s around me. 

For Uni assignments I will always hand my assignments time by making an early start, set out a structure, and spread it out until the last day, so it’s not as anxiety inducing to finish everything on the last day. Despite checking small syntax and grammar mistakes might be made, but I guess it’s normal for students to make blips here and there.

I hate how pretty much everyone in my family older than me (including parents, brother, aunts, uncles, cousins slightly older than me, etc.) has used a ""tough love"" excuse to ""justify"" what they've done to me. I am now 34 years old and am beginning to approach the age that various family members were when they traumatized me. I was 7 years old when my father was 34 and 18 years old when my brother was 34. When my brother was 34; he already had a 15-year-old son. His son died at the age of 18.

When I was 26 years old; I remember my father telling me, ""when you have children of your own; you'll understand."" I don't have any children, never had any, and I don't plan to.

Whenever I've tried bringing it up to them the things they did and said that traumatized me; they simply respond with things like, ""I don't remember that happening,"" or, ""that was a long time ago,"" or, ""get over it,"" or, ""you're weak,"" even now when I'm officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder, social anxiety, PTSD, and two psychotic disorders as a 34-year-old man.

I've been on Zoloft for 6 weeks and 2 weeks on a proper dose (150mg). It worked the first time but doesn't seem to have any effect the second time. Same with citalopram. I've tried brintellix and effexor as well but it did nothing neither.

I am horrified, embarrassed, and ashamed. I am so scared of how my photos will be used. My mental health is so much worse, i was seriously considering dying yesterday.

1697398977.0,I've just had a breakup and feel hopeless.,"So I'm 15 and this is the first breakup I've ever had. Even when i was in the relationship i felt suicidal and i feel even more so now, I'm so ugly and unloveable. I had been rejected and ghosted numerous times by girls while other people in my class are being bombarded with these same people reaching out to them. I have an ugly nose, eyes, assemetrical jaw. My face is so inadequate that nobody else will love me with my gf gone, and nobody will be attracted to me until I get fillers/surgery but I would need to get the money for that anyway. I have no friends, and I have nobody to comfort me when I'm taking the bus which is already too stressful of an environment for me. The only positive attribute that i have is my intellect but if I feel like I'm going to be doomed to live my entire life in seclusion against my own will. I know I shouldn't be thinking about dating this much at my age, but my previous experiences make me upset and I'm unhappy that people i want to talk to keep ghosting me and nobody reaches out to me, and i can never keep a friend for more than 2 months even though they claim im an underrated person and that im nice and all that shit that clearly doesn't matter because im ugly and ill never be able to fix my looks naturally.",mentalhealth

I do things like leave candles on overnight forgetting that I lit them and I very often leave the stove on after cooking something. I turn 19 in a couple days but I’m still not trusted to cook when I’m home alone. I also steal from people sometimes. Idk why. I just get the urges.

1697398751.0,My dreams feel real,"Hi, I think I need advise if anybody has any experince with something similar, because it's freacking me out a little. So basically now 2 times I have had dreams that feel way too real, and idk if this is a normal thing for other people but for me it's not, all dreams that I have ever had (or at least what I can remember) I always know they are not real, or like I do go along with what is happening in the dream but I can still somewhere in the back of my head understand it's a dream, they are also in general more fantastical and hazy and all over the place. 

But now for the first time some days ago I had a dream that just felt very real, and I'm not gonna go into everything (cause I can't even remember it all) and I can't even remember the order of it all, but basically in the dream I wake up in my house everything looks the same pretty much but then things just start happening and as things start happening like my blinds on my windows are gone and it like changes that first it's all the blinds and then just one of them or I get hungry and I'm about to make food but then I pause, do something else, and when I get back to making the food it has expired and has mold on it, or next moment where I for some reason left my house, I did not go anywhere just outside my door, I go back inside then to sleep and wake up and notice I left the door open and I freak out that 'did I actually like sleep walk and leave my house and leave the door open', so in this dream I thought I had just woken up from a another dream and this happened couple other times trough out this whole thing and each time felt like it was real, that 'I was now awake', also the clock or time in general was all over the place in this dream, but anyways at some point I finally start to think that this has to be a dream and I have to wake up, and I try to force my self awake, which I also fail a couple times like I'm still just waking up from a dream but within that dream, but finally I wake up and it's middle of the night had not even slept that long yet, but yeah kinda weirded out but forget it pretty fast.

Then last night same thing, I have a dream where I woke up in my house, it feels totally real again, but this dream is just shorter or feels like so at least, and different things happened, like this time my fridge is broken in a way I don't think it actually can be... but anyway, also I think I started to get a feeling like somebody had broken my fridge so I freaked out about if someone random was in my house, then I open my closet where there were 3 of my younger siblings, like they had like beds and everything in there, but yeah so now I'm playing with my siblings, and then at somepoint the other two kinda just dissapeared somewhere I was just with one of them, and then the one with me hugged me from behind while I was sitting on the floor, which at first was very cute but then it started to hurt a little, I was not in any huge pain and agony but I just felt like I could not move and it was slightly hurting on my right side, just this uncomftorable pressure, and then at that point I again realized I need to wake up and at some point I then did and was weirded out about it all again.

But so here I am to ask if anybody has gone through anything similar and does this mean something or is like indication of something more specific, I have been more stressed/anxious and even more paranoid recently, but these things usually come and go with me, or like what I mean is that I have been in similar headspace before, but have not gotten anything like this happen so yeah.

1697376913.0,When do you know you are burned out?,"Hi all! I am a marketing manager and I’ve been with the same company for 5+ years. I am a high-performing employee. I’ve had multiple promotions in the last years. I even left for a couple of months to pursue a unique opportunity they hired me back as if I had never left right after. I have a set of skills that’s pretty rare and, until recently, was known to be very optimistic even in the face of challenge.

Up until recently, I worked in a team of 7. 2 of my colleagues are on mat leave, the last one left a few weeks ago. The company is on a hiring freeze and decided not to hire replacements. One of them has minimal impact in my day-to-day, but the second one require that I take on more work and an additional direct report, which I did not mind at first because it was a bit quiet and could use some additional stimulation. Needless to say, it did not stay quiet for long and the projects started coming in quickly as soon as my last colleague left on mat leave.

A week ago, the company did lay-offs and a colleague was let go. Since this is sudden, I have to pick up some of the pieces of this person’ work to ensure nothing falls between the cracks. I also work a company-wide project that will be over in a few weeks, but that is quite time-consuming and a bit chaotic as we approach the deadline.

For the last few weeks, I’ve been working between 10-12 hours every weekday. It’s not like my boss asks me to do that, but there is just a lot of work and deadlines. And working this amount of hours only helps me staying afloat. I don’t work on weekends yet, but feel very bad and stressed that I don’t, but I try to stick to this limit. 

I have started being a bit bitter and sarcastic towards my job (I try to be mindful of this when deadling with my direct reports). I also have more trouble sleeping than usual (tired but wired when bedtime comes). When I don’t work, I can’t get myself to do anything and even the most basic home tasks seems impossible to do. Is this burnout? When do you know for sure you are burned out? Can burnout happen this fast (after a few weeks)? What are some tips to limit damage and try to get back on my feet?",mentalhealth

I used to be able to have a normal amount of friends, even if they didn’t really like me that much. now, i have one friend, and i think he’s starting to hate me. he used to consider me his best friend, and i did too, but yesterday we were having a conversation and i said “cmon, you can tell me we’re bestfriends” and he said, “who said that?”. honestly it just really hurt, because a few days before that at school i wanted him to go with me to go talk to people (me and him normally walk around during breaks and go talk to people that he knows or that i know) and he said something along the lines of “you can go by yourself, stop following me around like a pet” and that sentence has still been stuck in my head. maybe i should take the hint and stop being friends with him, i’m pretty sure he’s getting sick of me. we were hanging out yesterday with a bunch of other people, people that only he knew, and some of us were sitting down and eating and talking. it actually wasn’t that bad, until my friend brought up our earlier conversation where i said to him that we were bestfriends, and he was laughing. he turned to me and said, “i’m just kidding” but i was still really embarrassed. these were new people too, so it was even worse. none of those girls even liked me, they were all so much more mature than me, they were all super skinny, pretty, and had really good style. one of the girls that i felt really insecure around was this blonde, white, super skinny girl who had the most gorgeous features ever, and had so many friends that i couldn’t even imagine having that much. she is who exactly i have always wanted to be. she was cool, social, and stylish. i felt so insecure around her…i thought i looked good when i left the house, but when i saw her i immediately felt ugly for the rest of the night. think a few times two of the girls laughed at me, but i couldn’t tell. a girl who i had a talking stage with was also there, but we had stopped talking to each other, and i lost feelings. she was flirting with me a bit, and then asked me to hoco. i said yes, i didn’t want to be mean, but i just felt bad. id much rather be friends with her. i’m just praying that i catch feelings for her so i don’t lead her on. and if i were to friends one her, all of her friends would hate me. i don’t know what to do anymore, i’m just so stuck. i just wish the universe could give me what i want— to be social, to be prettier, to have a cool friend group, to not be so weird. i don’t know why i was born this way. i wish i could be normal, better, like those girls that i hung out with yesterday. i wish i was that blonde girl i was talking about. wishing to be someone is weird, but i just wish i was her. i don’t know why i’m this way. my mom and sister think i’m a loser, and my dad is just sad that i don’t have friends. i don’t know why my social life is this way— i’m not terribly ugly, i have some sense of fashion, i know social cues, i can talk to people, i’m not mean, i know how to act around people. i just wish my social life was how i want it to be.",mentalhealth

I am a 37 year old Male. My mother (63y Female) has become mentally ill. I don’t know exactly when it started, but this whole year has been pretty bad. I believe it’s related to a back injury she had falling off a ladder at her old job a few years ago, but that’s only a theory. Her back is still messed up from that.

She has been hallucinating “bugs” and strange things that make no sense. She gets very defensive and angry when you say they’re not real. She also tells me wild conspiracy theories. My step-dad isn’t much help, as he is an alcoholic who drinks the day away. When he isn’t drunk, it seems like he cares but I think he doesn’t know what to do so he turns to booze. I just got off the phone with her today and she told me that she would disown me if “doctors came and dragged her to psych ward.” She seems convinced I’m conspiring against her.

This whole situation is weighing on me heavily. It’s causing me crippling anxiety and I don’t know how much longer I can take it. What do I do? Who do I call? I live paycheck to paycheck and have literally no extra money, so I can’t bankroll any help. I’m at a complete loss.",mentalhealth

1697395191.0,Did I hallucinate??,"So I just joined Reddit not long ago, and normally lurk, I don't typically make posts. I do intend to speak with both my therapist and my doctor about this, but I want some unbiased opinions, particularly if you can relate to this or if you are a mental health professional yourself. Any/all responses and advice are appreciated.

About a week or so ago, I 33F got an email from my child's school saying something along the lines of having a meeting in the room above the cafeteria at 7:20am, and that they would walk the younger ones to class when it was over. It's only for the athletics students, which my child is in athletics. For the life of me, I cannot remember what day, or the reason, and everyone I've asked so far literally has NO CLUE what I'm talking about. They just make a weird face and go, ""Huh?""

Like, did I dream this but I thought it really happened? Did I hallucinate? I haven't exactly had a restful sleep in years due to some physical health issues, but this is really freaking me out. I know it sounds so small and silly but I can't tell if this actually happened or if I dreamed it or if something else could be wrong.

I've never hallucinated (that I know of) and I know mostly they are frightening, but is it possible they can be mundane too? Or like, could it have been one of those dreams you have right as you're waking up? Most likely just a dream right?

Please ask me any questions cause I may not have said enough here to give a clear picture but I'm not sure what else I can say at the current moment except what I have given, so please ask me questions. I'm really freaked out here. Literally NO. ONE. knows anything about this meeting except me and I remember thinking, ""I need my baby to attend that, it seems important."" Like HOW  does no one, not even the athletics teachers, have any clue about what I'm talking about? Because I swear I got that email and I remember how detailed it was but ironically the stuff I need to really know I can't remember. Any ideas what is going on here?? TIA.",mentalhealth

1697392149.0,"What is the best therapy form for trust issues, fear of being cheated on and trauma from infidelity in previous relationship?","I have come to the point that I HAVE to do something about these problems. For a long time I have forced my self to act as a normal and good girlfriend who functions normally in the relationship, but it is so demanding that I have now become exhausted and depressed. I think the reason why I feel this way may be from experiencing a lot of infidelity and lies in a previous relationship.  
  
  
**So I really need to find out which form of treatment can help. Metacognitive therapy? Emotion-focused therapy? Something else?**  
  
   
  
I'll try to briefly explain what I'm struggling with:  
  
**The problems unfold as follows:**  
  
\- I spend a LOT of time and effort worrying about (and imagining scenarios) that my partner will be unfaithful sometime in the future. I simply feel that there is such a high probability that it will have to happen at some point, that it is ruining my quality of life now.  
  
\-This means that I have problems committing myself completely (having children, buying a house together, etc.), and sometimes it gets me in a sudden a bad mood and makes me fell bitter (because it is almost like I'm alreadt angry at him, for something he hasn't even done, but might do in the future).  
  
\- I think it is difficult to imagine a happy life together with any man, since I think that the risk of infidelity and/or being abandoned is so high.  
  
\- This also means that I become very attached to my partner and always prioritize being with him over friends. I often avoid, for example, going on a girl's trip, because I am then afraid that he will use the opportunity to go out drinking/partying, or that he will be inspired to go on a boy's trip (and then I feel that the risk of infidelity increases). So this also makes me feel trapped by my own need for control over my boyfriend  
  
   
  
And now, living like this for a few years, has made me really depressed. I hate that I can't have a healthy relationship. I hate that all my energy revolves around the relationship, and that I am unable to find joy and/or prioritize other things in life. I deprioritize friends, find no joy in doing things without my partner, and struggle to stay motivated at work and care about my career. I just want to be normal and have a normal functioning relationship, and be free (from myself) to do all sorts of things with friends (go on trips and out on the town etc) and enjoy it. I want to have children and buy a home with my partner, and dare to just go all in on this relationship, without being afraid that he will cheat or leave me.",mentalhealth

1697378030.0,I shaved my beard and managed to go out to meet people,"Yesterday I had to attend at a pizzeria because my gf's birthday is coming up and she wanted to celebrate with her friends last night there. I don't have friends, so I don't go out anywhere except with my girlfriend, and it's been months since the last time I hung out with her and her friends together. I was pretty anxious about this and and I felt weird all day yesterday because of it.

But then when it was close to leaving I shaved my beard before taking a shower, and already started to feel a little better. Then went to the pizzeria with my gf, and things there were fine, there was no big issue. I guess I kinda managed it pretty well. Lately when looking to the mirror I was feeling like I was older than 30, despite being only 25; but then today I woke up, looked myself in the mirror, and for a moment I felt like I got back the way I looked when I was 20 years old. It's pretty hard for me to keep up my shaving, bcs I like to keep a beard, so if I have to shave it, I just trim and reduce its volume, but it takes time and demand you to be very careful; as I never leave the house I usually just leave it on the way it is and sometimes it grows for months and months...

Yeah, despite of depression getting pretty worse lately and my usual fuc\*\*ng high anxiety, I managed to shave my beard and go out and talk to ppl and things were fine. I hope it may be the start of an improvement... Thank you for your time reading this",mentalhealth

1697390825.0,Mental health failing entrepreneur,"Hi

I (37 M)  used to think I was mentally stable and I never really understood mental illness of any sort (depression, anxiety etc). I started an electrical contracting business during covid because I lost my job as an electrician in a mine (due to covid). In hindsight, as a mining electrician, it was probably a bad idea to start a business in residential electrical but here we are. 

I’m not sure if it’s coincidental or not, but i seem to have developed a whack of mental illness in the last year. The last 3 months have been awful. About 2 days ago I wanted to get hurt - not die, but I wanted to get beaten up badly or in a car wreck or something like that. Im extremely overwhelmed at this business and I make mistakes that send me spirialing out of control. I drove 1.5 hours to a job and had the wrong parts. I bought parts 3 times for this job, lost them twice apparently, used them on another job once. I thought I had them but didn’t.  Yesterday, on a different job it was going poorly (as usual). It came out of nowhere but I punched myself square in the face- really hard. I make the same mistakes over and over and the other day I thought that if I hurt myself, it might teach me a lesson instead of continuing to do the same thing over and over. 

This type of work is newish, but I’m extremely disorganized (diagnosed with adhd about a month ago) stronger meds one week ago. Concerta. 

My wife (35 F) is usually very supportive but she’s all but done with this business and probably me. As I’m done with both also. 

We started a massive entire home renovation, I am in a custody battle from a previous marriage, plus this business, not knowing anything bout business, new meds, phone keeps ringing with jobs fixing people’s junk etc and it’s all way too much.  I was dealing with it but after I developed thoughts, and an action about self harm, I thought I should reach out.

I’m not sure what my question is. 

Is it possible that this business, reno, custody battle all just added up and made me go crazy? Or was I crazy before and it’s just shining through now? I can’t sit still, not one second if there’s work to do. But I work at about 10% efficiency. Even writing this seems like a waste of time. But I need major help. I don’t know what to do",mentalhealth

1697336499.0,I'm lonely but everyone annoys me (34F) or gives me the ick. WTF is wrong with me?,"I've had some of the hardest yet most peaceful years of my life since the pandemic happened. I thought the peace came from all the introspection and inner work I've done, and maybe that has contributed, but I've recently realized that I have felt so at peace because I'm barely socializing and have basically cut many people out of my life. I am lonely, though.  

I want friends, I want romantic partners, but everyone eventually irritates the shit out of me, gives me the ick, or I feel I can't trust them. Or they just don't like me. Can't imagine why /s. I just don't know wtf is wrong with me. I don't think this is necessarily new. I've since stopped holding onto people for the wrong reasons (I think...) and now I'm holding onto nothing. I have like two adult relationships that are healthy-ish and meaningful. One is with my ex-husband, one is with my girlfriend. I will likely be breaking up with her soon bc I don't think we are compatible as a long-term romantic couple. And I already know she will not want to remain friends. So, basically, one meaningful relationship and I don't know how sustainable that one is either. 

Socializing is not easy for me and seems to be more draining than ever. I have kids, responsibilities, etc. It's hard to get out. When I do go out, I don't really talk to anyone. I've moved around my whole life. The friends I did make that stuck have lost touch over the years. 

I'm sure I have attachment issues, I've been diagnosed with PTSD, too. I've been looking for a therapist, but haven't had much luck.

1697373461.0,Am I ill?.,"I am a fourteen year old girl; I turn fifteen in 22 days. I don't really have much to say about myself and I question what differentiates me from my peers. I have two brothers, a couple friends who only ever reach out to me, and a loving boyfriend who I stay with on weekends. I like drawing and reading. I have straight A's in English and strong opinions. I like writing about my opinions and reading about other people's opinions. I don't make people laugh very much, and hardly talk. People don't notice if I slip away during lunchbreak. I feel boring. Where is my personality? What joyful traits do people admire me for? I don't see any outstanding talents in the things I am passionate about. I am plain. Mediocre. This paragraph is plain.

I think you could agree that I am basic and indifferent, but I struggle to find those who understand me and speak to me with kindness and understanding. Those who take the time to pick out the right words to comfort someone. I read Albert Camus' books and am interested in nihilism, absurdism, suicide. I don't see many good things about living and think about killing myself everyday. Of course I am happy and silly when I feel like it and spend hours appreciating the beauty of life and how gorgeous it is, even when I am feeling like this. I will stare at the night sky with joy in my smile and think about how I should kill myself right there. I don't think I'd ever actually do it but sometimes I cross the roads without looking and stare at the river a little too long. 

I think about the effects it would have on my family, my friends and community and think about how much pain it would cause them. It makes me want to commit even more and I wonder why. I wonder why they love me so much. My boyfriend, I understand, I listen to him and support him when he feels suicidal and pleasure him when he wishes. My friends, I understand, even though I doubt they would cry. I talk to them about boys and laugh and you know how it goes. My Mum, I suppose I understand, but it feels like she hates me at the moment. She fights me on my opinions and tells me to get over my feelings, but she did birth me so I suppose she would be a little upset. 

I've been thinking about my post's title and maybe I'm not ill or crazy, maybe I'm just a fourteen year old girl with lots of hormones. That would probably be a reasonable answer but I want it to be more than that because I want to be ill. I want to be sick. I want my bones to stick out and have blacked out vision. I want to be more underweight than I already am. I want to be able to die and I don't want anyone to notice.

Also, thank you if you read my post, I know it's large and I could write so much more about entirely different topics like maturity and the human condition and feminism, misogyny, but I might do that later if you want me to. I know some people are going to downvote this post which is okay and I would love some feedback as to why. Let me hear all of your opinions lol.

1697386888.0,Emotions and Fun,"Hey there redditor!

My first post, so sorry if it isn't like the others.

If anything is unclear, just ask :)

&#x200B;

I really have trouble with feeling empathy/building emotional connections with people. Everything has been going upwards at escape velocity in the last 1-2 months. I've met so many cool people while doing the things I love because I am so good in them, regardless if its Sports or Academia. Even dating/making friends have been extremely easy, to the point where I almost have too many. 

&#x200B;

The problem isn't with success, it lies in my past. 

I almost saw, heard and felt everything you could've imagine. Be it suicide attempts, cancer, heavy accidents, betrayal, heartbreak, (....) in the upmost extreme manner. It is important to note, that it was always somebody really close to me / somebody who really mattered to me, **NOT MYSELF**. So **please don't worry** about me :)

Because of that I kind of have lost practically all emotions regarding other humans and sometimes i don't even feel happy or in fact any emotion. But paradoxically I am constantly extatic and wouldn't want to change anything, besides live life, since I've never expected life to be this great. :D

I've only talked about my real problems with one person, because they were so extreme (sometimes people would look at me with fear of what I had to go through if I told them). And that person is currently in Military, so I can't even really write to the person. And talking to that person really went a long way.

&#x200B;

**Questions:**

So do you have any pointers on how to feel like having fun/emotions/trust around new people or having emotions generally? Also how do you cope with extreme stress load from past experiences? And finally how do you meetups with normal friends?",mentalhealth

I wanted to ask if there are thing I could tell her to do instead of seriously hurting herself like something along the lines of a hairtie on the wrist. this specific one didn't work but I am here to ask if she does it what I can advise her. maybe its important to know that she is 16 and I am 17 and moving out is not an option for her. so basically I just wanted something I can suggest her that doesnt seriosly hurt her.,mentalhealth

1697385841.0,Meditation help?,"I have CPTSD and bipolar 1 and have been using meditation to try to manage symptoms (along with medication obviously). At first guided meditation was really helpful in dealing with feelings of anxiety and panic but lately when I try it always brings up images of something really traumatic for me and I end up having panic attacks. My mental health was shaky at best before but now that I’ve lost a coping/relaxation method I feel afraid all the time that these feelings of panic will push me back in to bipolar psychosis. I only just began to recover from a horrible episode last year that required weeks of hospitalization. Yes, I’ve talked to a therapist and found her to be completely unhelpful.

 I know the methods to deal with panic attacks and I use them when it’s really bad but what’s worse is this insidious sort of undercurrent of feeling that makes me feel sick like I can’t breathe if I even begin to think about what happened. It’s not exactly fear but a nauseating, squeezing sort of feeling if that makes any kind of sense. Ruminating sucks and I try not to but meditation had been my go-to for dealing with that.

 I guess I don’t really have a question. I just don’t know how to even begin to function normally right now. I alternate between isolating because I can’t stand to be around people right now and going running to try to burn out all these negative feelings but neither really works.",mentalhealth
1697385771.0,How to cope with my mom? Am I a sociopath? ( really long post),"I have a very strained rls with my mom. I moved away from my mom 13 years ago to study abroad. But since I was around 13-14 till now, I always feel pressured, anxiety, agitated when my mom is around. I don't like to be touched by her; before calling her, I need to make sure I am in a good/stable mood. When I was a teenager, I always picture an ideal mother: always calm and stable, a person who has a stable life herself for a kid to lean on. If I need to think about my mom with 3 words, it is going to be: tears, depression, and sadness. She doesn't go to work ( by being a landlord), doesn't have relationship at the moment, and I don't think she has a big social life either.

I understand that my mom has suffered a lot from her life, that caused her to say thing that traumatize me but I understand that she did not mean to hurt me. But the people around her, including me always feel a "" negative energy"" radiates out from her that kind of  suck the others' emotion into that negative direction. Almost every time I talk to her, all I here is complain about why person A treated her like that, person B said that bad things to her., or why stuff like this always happen to her life.etc to such a point I feel like 95% of the people around her have problems or treat her badly.  Before my parent got divorced, everytime they argued, my mom always pulled me in to make my dad felt guilty about the things that he did. Every time she said something that other did not believe her, she always said :"" I swear on the head of X  ( me) that it is true"". When I was a kid, everytime I had my frustration outside ( school/friends/love..), and showed that to her by changing my tone when talking, she always told me "" why do you talk to me in that tone? have I ever talk to you in that tone? you need to talk to me in a better manner"". So I always like I am her only life-boat, or a shield until such an extend that I always have to control my emotions around her, to act like I am emotionless, always stable because I can't show my weak side to this person ... If she knows I am in a rls, I feel like she gets jealous with that person because I spend too much time texting or thinking about my love life. Or my rls with my dad has improved a lot after their divorce and my mom said something like :"" he just want to make it up to you. If you traumatize about your childhood then you should blame him, not me"". Yes, my dad did a lot of bad things when they were together but he moved on and treat me okay so now I can talk to him like a friend, and I don't really associate him with my bad memories anymore. My mom, in another hand, whenever I talk to her, somehow it always make me remember about those bad memories. I pretty much set a clear boundary around her by not sharing my private life with her and just listen to whatever she wants to say whenever we talk, and she told me that hurt her a lot because I don't see her as my mom, and if I understand her situation I should have loved her more not talk to her with this cold attitude.

Our relationship gets worse till the point that I do not want to hear another complain from her, even if she is sick, or if she is suffering from something. I feel like my emotion for her is so full that I can't take anything from her anymore. Even when sometimes I do realize that she just wants to make me feel comfortable around her but my automatic response is to withdraw from her at that moment that I have a really hard time to control or act normal around her. There was a time I tried to tell her if you love me, you have to promise me these 3 things :"" don't talk about suicide anymore, don't compare me  with my cousins or whoever she knows from her life (because she always ask me why my aunts treat my counsins badly but they still love their moms and I do not) , don't talk about my dad anymore because it triggers my bad childhood memories. "" And she tried to explain or justified why she said the things she said but I did not care anymore, I just wanted her to stop those talking so we can both move on and hopefully improve our rls. I just want to have a conversation when she say she is happy, she is seeing this person, this person treats me nice, i love my life, I am doing this and I love it ..etc.

Now I have the ability to bring her to the country I am living in ( she doesn't want to live in our home country anymore because all she had is sadness) and she wants to live with me because she is all alone. I understand her situation but the thinking of living with her scared the crap out of me, and I am also in a long/stable relationship right now that I want to protect. All I want is to support her financially if she moves to a new country and I will try my best to visit her as much as I can , also try to open more to her whenever we talk. I plan to let her stay in an area where she has friends/relatives and doesn't have to really speak the new language because we have a community there.

But am I a sociopath? am I selfish? why can't I love my mom more? why do I feel so uncomfortable around her? The fact that I have to make another call to her cause me anxiety. All I feel right now is guilt and responsibility because she is all alone and I am her only child.

I am exhausted every damn day, and have been from months to years at a time. Right now it’s been a period of about 6 months, everyday headaches/ nonspecific or specific pain, and I struggle with depression/anxiety along with some other things.

BUT no matter how bad things get-I’m close to killing myself, can barely get out bed, pain is a 7-8… I make myself go to group fitness class 3-4 times a week, and I feel like this means I’m just lazy when it comes to how I exhausted, sad, and in pain that I feel the rest of the time.

I’ve been asked how I can do this, but barely anything else, and my answer is just, **it’s really all I have sometimes.**

My doc recently said I look healthy from a visual standpoint, all labs are fine… (pain is explained partially by some physical conditions, but still not convincing to them) and I can work out, so how bad is it really?

Do I really fit the criteria for chronic pain/chronic illness, or severe depression, when I still work out? Am I just making it all up?

Why?? Why don't people support those who struggle?

And most importantly, how can we ever be ourselves in a society like this?

1697365161.0,"Losing motivation, losing energy, losing willingness. What do I do now?","Hello reddit!

I suffer from ADHD, have been my whole life (17, M). It was manageable at the beginning, as I could figure out the answers to my exams at school without concentrating too much in class, so I had time to spend on myself after school.

Now however, school is asking for too much of my energy, to the point where my daily 37 mg of concerta (Methylphenidate) is simply doing nothing. I can't get myself to do anything. I forget to eat and drink, too tired to perform my hobbies, I can't get myself to care about anything anymore.

Just thinking of standing up is demotivating enough for me to not exercise, just having to move my hands around became enough to demotivate me from playing the piano, just thinking of having to google things became enough to demotivate me from programming, or engaging in any project. Even gaming, which is my main source of dopamine, is becoming to feel like a chore. I simply can't do stuff no matter how important might it be.

I'm starting to think ADHD isn't the only factor, but even if it is then it's getting pretty bad. Just wanting to stay alive is already tiring enough and taking a lot of my time at this point. I'm unable to sleep, unable to take care of myself, unable to care, and there's pretty much nobody that I can rely on at all.

Therapy and psychologists/psychiatrists appointments are expensive as hell, and Lebanon is in the middle of a never-before-seen economical crysis, so we can't afford it. Insurance doesn't cover shit.

I'm in this alone and probably will still be for a few years.

Please help. At least tell me what the hell is wrong with me and i'll manage the rest like I always have. I don't think I will be able to tank it all otherwise, not for long.

1697374964.0,My struggle,"
Hi. I’m Harriet, and professionals are not listening. 

I’m from the uk, and the psychiatrists in the NHS are LITERALLY DOG SHIT. 

so. Where to begin…

When I was at school I was put on a fast track to education plan. It meant I was a “gifted kid.” I believe it was under an oxbridge foundation thing, but I can’t remember, and my ‘mother’ won’t show me the documents for some reason and I don’t know where she’s hidden them.

Long long long story short - there was another guy on this fast track thingy and he groomed me. His father and him were very sexually abusive to say the least, and to keep it brief. 
But they didn’t technically abuse me. They abused Mirror. Mirror is a……. How to say this…. She’s dead basically. She is a vengeful spirit. Fuck sake. I already sound delusional. Mirror is 100% real. I can assure everyone of that. It’s a very complex situation though, and this post would go on forever if I didn’t keep it brief. 

The boy broke up with me after 3 years or something? and I felt nothing. For a while. 

Then I was taken to a Glenfield mental health unit. The psychiatrist said “there is not a court on the land that will deem you without capacity. If you want to kill him, on your head be it” and he let me go. 

Mirror killed fifteen people that night.

I was taken back after spending some time (?) in custody. They VERY quickly deemed my without capacity. So I was sent back. Which I found funny.


After a while a while a while of background deliberation - I was sent home on an outpatient section, I believe. Something to do with my age or something??? But they never seem to check. I’ve literally lived away from that place for over a year since - and they never even fucking knew.

Mirror discovered online dating. Thought it would be a good idea to find some sustenance. She found a guy.

We’ve been together ever since, but I keep wanting to kill myself. And John won’t go away either. But he’s good company for mirror. 

Mirror changed her mind and decided she wanted to see if she could fall in love with him.

Didn’t work.

I’m on medication. But it makes me fat. The psychiatrist says it doesn’t. But I know he’s lying to me. 

I want to cut the fat off my body sometimes.

It’s worse in the spring 100%. But he didn’t listen. He said “everybody gets down sometimes”

I have been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder.

But I disagree. A lot. 

Another psychiatrist said I’m possessed. I believe him. He really helped cement my belief that I’ve been right all along. He’s the only decent one I’ve had. 

I’m very confused, but I also feel nothing.

And I won’t apologise for killing those people. Why am I the bad person???? I didn’t even do anything, and even if I did, they were terrible. I did the right thing.

Can anyone recommend private psychiatric help? I feel i probably need some guidance or something. Because my medication is stupid and so are the psychiatrists.

(I mentioned everything here to my mum, and she said I seem fine. But I need a second opinion - preferably from a non-shit psychiatrist?)",mentalhealth
1697374235.0,Doing anything takes too much effort and it's slowly ruining my life.,"TLDR: Title. 

For some reason the main symptom of whatever disorder I have is that it's inherently exhausting for my brain to just... ""do"" anything. It just seems to take a hundred times more resources for me than for other people. 
It's not a specific part of acting that takes more effort, and it seems to be independent of the context of doing (i.e. what I want to do, what environment I want to do it in, how I feel, what I've done before, etc.). It's the process itself which drains energy. 
But the weird thing is that doing things is not at all difficult for me. I don't have any problems with executive functions, nor with motor control, nor with cognition. 

My therapist and I have gone through an incredibly long list of possible diagnoses, and we've considered hundreds of other possible psychological causes. We've also considered physical causes, I've had my thyroid and blood checked, but it's rather unlikely since I don't have any physical symptoms (not even ones that might match things like ME/CFS, Long-Covid, etc.). 

It's so frustrating, because my main symptom doesn't really... exist in the mental health literature. It's always something else that only gets called ""everything takes too much effort"".
One example is when I try to look this up on the internet: It tends to be either ""You're already exhausted from something else, so doing more takes way more effort than it should"" or ""This aspect of doing things is way more difficult for you, which makes an 'easy' process into a 'difficult' one, thus taking more effort"". I have never found anyone or anything that even remotely resembles my experience. 

The worst thing about this is that it seems to get worse. I've already showed signs of this since early childhood, then it started to make itself known more and more throughout school, and now as a young adult it's really starting to ruin my life. I'm very lucky to have a really good support network, but I still kinda need to, you know, interact with the world if I want to survive/live in it. Apart from the fact that I also *want* to interact with the world. 

If you're still reading this vent, thank you! 
I'm writing this for other reasons, apart from venting. 
One is to maybe, just maybe, find someone else who has this symptom. If you think you relate, please feel free to message me. 
The other is to practice explaining my experience to others. There will undoubtedly be other situations where I have to explain myself, so please feel free to ""review"" this post (in a friendly way, please). What I'm specifically interested in are the parts where I succeed in being clear and understandable about my experience, and the parts where I don't. 

In any case, have a nice (or at least tolerable) day!",mentalhealth

1697372834.0,This is about my father. Not necessarily about me but it does affect me.,"So I'm 24 m and I'm stuck at home due to my disability don't want to get into that.

So I'm here taking care of my father and my mother. Essentially they're both 60 ish.


Anyway on to the meat of the subject it all happened a long long while ago. I found my neighbor smoking a bit. A little bit of weed out of a bottle in my infantile mind. I thought it would be a great idea to tell my father about it but ever since then he's been going all on and on and on. But the neighbors how their thugs and thugs drug dealer and all this stuff. So you need to call the police if you need to be dealt with. Need to be dealt with.



I jumped ahead of it there

We've had any noisy neighbors for a while now. Noise cigarette buds over the fans parties you know the whole spiel. But it's affected my father in a way that I don't know how it's affected him and I don't know how to help him.


So we'll start with a recent event. My father is currently obsessed and I mean obsessed with getting my neighbor's tree trimmed of the borderline. We got the tree turned before but he was not satisfied. He wanted to get a trimmed even more so she got an arborist out to get the tree trimmed now. I was against the idea for a long time but he finally was able to copes me into it by going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on about it finally after mentally giving up and let him do whatever the f****** wants.


My father is obsessed with the neighbors to such a degree is horrifying and it's putting a massive damper on my mental health and my mother's. He sighs some pops gets really angry, not violent. He's never been violent. Just really angry ignores people. It's become bad and it's I don't know what to do.

He keeps going on about how the neighbors need to be dealt with its his reputation on the line.

How are people going to look at me? See me back down because of him.

 He needs to be dealt with
He needs to be dealt with. That's his favorite line.

I think it's purely for vengeance. He's being purely vengeful.

My father doesn't work. He's going to disability that prevents him from working so he's been in the house for the whole time it's getting worse and worse over time. We tried to tell him to try some antidepressants saying that will help him after he tries some, which I know now was a terrible idea. Technically my mother's idea. Terrible anyway.

But now he keeps using the line well you told me to take the pills I look we are the neighbors still there.

We hope the pills would calm him down. Make him think more rationally evidently not.


He lashed out of my mother one time. Not physically but verbally because they were driving down the driveway and as we're driving down the driveway my father was staring my neighbor directly in the eyes and my mother could see it so she tried to get him to stop. He got up to stop but it got really f****** angry in the car sounding shouting at her. Like how f****** dare you do that to me and all that?.


So as you've seen this post that's all over the place cuz I don't really know where to stop and start.

I'm honestly at my witts end and I don't know what to do.
We had a dog before when we had the dog. It was never this bad. He never used to talk but the neighbors. But ever since we lost the dog everything's been on level 10. Sorry level 500.

Some people may say when reading that. Why don't you get another dog? We've thought about that, but we're scared that he'll start neglecting the dog because he's more concerned with the neighbors and he won't walk the dogs. He doesn't want to encounter the neighbor whilst walking the dog.


So what do you think is up with my father.",mentalhealth

***But before the tl;dr:***

* Thank you so much to everyone that read this and gave thoughtful responses, feedback, and support. 
* **All I ask from you is to please be kind if you're taking the time to respond to me.** I wrote this because at the moment I'm not in the best frame of mind and have turned to reddit as a way to cope with my anxiety and depression.

***Important note***: 

* You'll read that I reference suicidal ideation. **I've never attempted suicide** and I am **NOT** in crisis. 
* However, suicidal ideation has been a regular mechanism of my fight or flight mode as strange as that may sound (although, in this subreddit, maybe not).

***tl;dr***

* I'm resistant to anxiety and depression medication due to concerns about their effectiveness, side effects, and a difficult family history that entails taking medication and it not really working. 
* I have a long history of mental health struggles, and ongoing struggles with anxiety and depression today. This is exacerbated by worries about money and work. 
* I've been going to talk therapy for a long time, I'm trying to move on, it's just really hard!
* I hope for a happier future despite not wanting to take medication for my anxiety and depression.

***Why I'm fearful of and resistant to taking medication for my anxiety and depression:***

* I really struggle at accepting that there is not really one prescribed method to treating anxiety and depression. Therefore, the idea of having to try different cocktails medications that are going to have their own set of side effects until you find something that works really bothers me.
* The medications aren't cures and like any substance, your body builds up a tolerance. Over time, the idea of having to up your dosage or switch drugs to get a similar effect is something I don't like the idea of.
* Even in small doses, I view these medications as powerful drugs. Although they're meant to help, they're not substances you can really stop taking. Sure, you can taper off, but over time your body and mind have become so accustomed to drugs to treat anxiety and depression that it's incredibly difficult to go back to a life of treating anxiety and depression in natural ways, e.g., exercise, mindfulness. I've never heard of any anecdotes of people stopping these drugs for good.
* The side effects! My god. From weight gain to libido impacts to whatever else. And these seems like the softer side effects. Sometimes they can be way worse!
* The time horizon for taking medication. Some people take it for years, few people take it until they level off, stop, and take it again when they need it. There is more research on the long-term use than exploring the short-term application. There is no solid proof that they should be taken for years or decades. Yet, people do. I don't like this idea of never stopping.
* The fact that the science and medical community don't truly have a handle on how to treat depression and anxiety is not reassuring. We've been giving medication to people for so long and the mind is still a mystery. New research debunks old research, new drugs debunk old drugs. It's like one big human test trial until we solve the mysteries of the mind! What the fuck!?
* Lastly, it's the for-profit healthcare industry that really upsets me. I equate being on the pharmaceutical companies' drugs to being a slave to them. You're on the hook and you can't just stop! I don't believe any bullshit story they might say to the public. There busienss is keeping people hooked on their drugs, despite any altruistic core. They need to deliver profits to shareholders, and that's the corporate way. So fuck them, they're ""wolves in sheep's clothing"".

***A little about me***

* I'm a person in my 30s and I have been living with anxiety for most of my life. 
* I remember starting to feel anxious and depressed around 12 years old before I knew what anxious and depressed meant. That's as far as I remember beginning to ideate suicide.
   * At 12 years old is the earliest I remember watching my mother always taking some medication for her anxiety depression and observing that they never quite seem to help her. However, she apparently has been on some kind of medication for at least 15-25 years before (I get different accounts from each parent smdh)
      * It was around this time she was incredibly depressed and anxious. She bet all her money on starting an Internet business that didn't work, so she had no money, her boyfriend and she split up, there was so so soooooo much stress in the home, coupled with fears of homelessness. 
      * I saw her bank receipts with negative balances, stacks of credit cards in her office, the phone never stopped ringing with debt collectors calling, watching her lie on the phone to debt collectors - what the fuck, man!? This is not something a kid should endure.
      * My environment at an early age was not a positive one. And it did not just begin at 12 years old. A negative environment existed even before that e.g., parents divorced, physical punishments - belt on the ass when I was little, horrible memories. So I spent a great portion of my childhood in negative feedback loops.
      * A year ago I asked my mother about this and she said that they've never quite helped her. Jesus, man! A lifetime of giving money to the pharmaceutical companies and it just helped her get by, yet she's still not happy.
* When I was in high school I didn't have any friends for most of it. I was bullied early on for my ethnicity and the way I looked, so I learned to stay out of people's way and not be noticed. It was such a sad and lonely time. Even writing this is really heavy on my heart. 
* I suffered in silence for years. Because of family trouble at home, I didn't feel like I could go to my parents and get help. I was all alone in my anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.
* I started going to therapy in my mid-20s for work stress and it was the beginning of a really deep and shared (w/my therapists) introspective journey. Finally I was able to talk to someone about everything bothering me.
* Therapy helped but always wore off. After 4 years of seeing one therapist I could tell that the good feeling of talk therapy was wearing off, and I was just talking about the same shit. I hit a brick wall, I've done the introspection, but there was no moving on from it.
* I briefly saw a CBT professional and picked up some skills. They can help from time to time.
* Today I still see a great therapist. I really helps to have someone to talk to, and I'm trying to move on from my pain from the past that persists through the present. But there is a frustration because I'm at the point where therapy is just a safe place to vent, but progress to a better life not burdened by my past and coping with anxiety and depressing is very very slow. I'm mindful that this can take years the way it took me years to feel like I've explored everything in my life and mind related to anxiety and depression.
* However, I can get so depressed and anxious at times. I have my good weeks and then stretches of bad weeks.

***What I'm anxious and depressed about***

* Writing this down is always a strange experience because when you write it down it never seems to be as bad as you catastrophize it to be
* Frankly, I'm just unhappy on regular intervals. Even when I'm mindful of all the good things to be thankful for, when I am falling back into a state of depression and anxiety, I am feeling horrible. Crying, anxious, depressed, thinking about suicide.
* There always seems to be this weight of discontentment that's ever present. I'm always so focused on the next thing that I don't appreciate the present. Things often aren't good enough for me when maybe they should be.
* I'm very often sad and burdened by the past, anxious about the present and future, and have this deep fear of being poor and broke like my parents. 
   * A lot of my fear and misery is tied to money unfortunately. Although I've gone out of my way to learn about money, budgeting, and investing, I'm still just always worried about it and that the bottom is going to drop. This is because of growing up in a home with money problems and fears of homelessness.
* The rat race of life and the corporate world really gets me down. 
   * I've been someone that has hated their work (probably like most people), and my work has left me on the spectrum of miserable and traumatized to some degree. 
   * The idea of slaving away for money that's never enough, living in places where it has become too expensive, doing work that's meaningless, I just think, what's the point. 
   * And this is when I ideate suicide. Slogging away for decades more to potentially retire with not enough? 
   * I look at my mother today, she's old, broke, depressed, still has to work - she says she likes to work, which may be true, but she also needs to work - and I know she also ideates suicide (apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it?)
* ***Note about work***: 
   * I'm trying to make a change. 
   * I've left my job and am doing a grad program, but there are plenty of existential crises in a grad program. 
   * What I'm fearful of what's next is this work misery. I'm really focused on trying to find a balance of good work culture while still making good money. 
   * I'm praying to God that the next road is one that is happier, if I can ever be just happier.

***Conclusion***

* Well that's it for now. If you made it here, my forever gratitude for reading my post.
* For those of you providing support, friendly suggestions and guidance, thank you thank you thank you! ",mentalhealth
1697369159.0,"I am always miserable and find a way to feel irritated, even though everything is good","Example: I'm starting my PhD, have wonderful people around me, have a roof above my head. But I still refuse to feel happy about it, because I'd need to share the bathroom with other people. And my whole happiness revolves around it, and I simply can't be happy that ""I got so far"" and where I am. 

Another example: I'm going home, every train and bus is on time, except the last one which I've missed and have to wait 15 minutes for the next one. Happiness is ruined for the day. 

Basically, one negative outweighs a hundred positives. It's not a simple ""being a bit annoyed"" thing. It really makes me go on a emotional rollercoaster and lose sleep over that. One second I'm ok, the next I'm angry, the next I'm sad, etc. It kicks me out of balance so much that I don't even know *what* to feel in the first place. 

I am self-aware enough to realize that it's a problem, but I can't just ""shut it down"". I really boil on the inside, there are full of (subconscious) emotions going on. So all this ""observe your thoughts"" thing just doesn't work, if you *physically* feel those emotions. I can't simply tell myself ""I'm too entitled for everything"" and boom all those negative emotions are shut down. It's like having a phobia of let's say dogs, and telling yourself ""I don't have to be afraid of them"". So magically, you suddenly don't feel any anxiety around dogs?

I mean, you know these auditory hallucinations just before you fall asleep? What I hear every night are screams of agony. Every day is just about me trying to battle my emotions, and trying to be somewhat emotionally stable. 

On top of all of that, I also think a lot about death, about how I'm wasting my time, about what will come after death, etc. I tried the ""positive nihilist"" outlook (i.e. ""nothing matters, so why do you worry about anything?"") but it makes me feel worse as I can't wrap my mind around a ""meaningless"" life. 

My questions would be: Why am I feeling like that, and what could I do to cope with that?",mentalhealth

Hello, 
I am 18 and in like 6 months I’ll graduate from school. Last week (monday to friday) I was away with my school and now I have two weeks holidays. And before I start I need to add that I know what my family did to me in my childhood was bad and can be considered abuse. They got better and better as I got older but now I feel disconnected to my parents. I love them like distant relatives and I live with them like roommates but I don’t love them like my parents. 
After I came back I cried for a day. I didn’t leave my bed, I couldn’t talk or look at my parents I just cried. My teacher is more like a father to me than my actual father and I was one week with him because he was the teacher we did the school trip with and now I am more dependent on him than before. I already wrote three helplines and my therapist because without help I won’t survive until November but I didn’t get an answer yet. I was an asshole to my friends so they won’t text and I don’t have the energy to text first because what am I supposed to say? I consider texting my teacher tomorrow or something but I don’t want to bother him. And friday my family and I go to Croatia for 10 days and then I have school again and have lots of exams and I really consider ending my life because I don’t want to live like this anymore. I can’t move out until I start university (in a year) because I don’t have money and I can’t start working because then school will be too much.

I always imagined my 20s to be a time to begin getting ready to be an adult and just starting to get by but this is absolutely the worst time period in my life. 24/7 from the moment I wake up I just feel pure depression. I have no desire to do absolutely anything at all. I am struggling to do basic home tasks that most people are able to do normally when they’re kids. Nothing brings me pleasure. I am broke and can’t even begin to imagine ever being able to afford healthcare services. And I fucking hate when people tell me that Ill feel happier when I’m older when I doubt I’m going to even get to live a long life because of how unhealthy my body is due to an eating disorder. I fucking hate my life. I hate every fucking decision I’ve ever made. I wish I was fucking dead and I hate that my parents ever decided to have me.

1697368240.0,What do you think about sharing the details of your self help/therapy with your partner?,"
So the backstory is that me(27F) and my boyfriend(29M) have had a really happy relationship from the beginning (almost a year now) but in the last months I’ve been struggling with my mental health and honestly feeling a bit like I’m cracking under the (self-imposed) pressure of being in a healthy relationship because most of my relationships, dating and family, have been unhealthy. Partly because of my issues and partly because I was attracted to people with issues and I know it stems from emotional abuse as a child and having to learn everything I know now about healthy communication and love after moving out of my moms house at 18. I’ve come a long way, and what I have with my boyfriend is really good and genuine, but I struggle with self esteem, people pleasing instead of advocating my needs which leads to pent up feelings of neglect, which make me triggered, and then I get reactionary. This was the case for the last month.

Well we talked about it and agreed that’s not what we want and both took responsibility for our parts in it and expressed we want to work on this. It wasn’t anything crazy, just a lot of small seriously stupid arguments that would have been avoided with better communication/ expectations and one more emotionally dramatic argument which really was my fault. 

I’d like to go to therapy but the cost is prohibitive.. so I started with journaling, learning about anxiety, I went on antidepressants a few months ago, and most recently I’ve started reading Codependent No More which is seriously so on point and is really helping my perspective. 

I don’t know if there is even a right answer to this, but would it be TMI to share with my boyfriend what I’ve learned about myself and what I’ve reflected on from the book and other journaling exercises I’ve done recently? They really get into patterns I’ve experienced in my life and also details of how the current situation with him is triggering my anxiety. The main topics are shame, fear of rejection, and deep rooted insecurities that I’m bad and don’t deserve good thing/can’t keep them, plus where I think they come from and where they’ve come up in my life. So basically a lot of things that an warp one’s perspective on a relationship. 

He’s really patient and understanding and I want an intimate, honest relationship but I don’t want him to identify me with the labels codependency or anxious attachment if it’s something I’m actively working to improve… and I also don’t want him to feel pressure or guilty because of my baggage, like I’d never want him to just stay with me just because he knows I have these insecurities and he doesn’t want to make them worse. 

Id love to hear some thoughts/experiences. Is this something that is helpful to share with your partner or is it better to process these things on my own/with my close friends and then share the solutions I’ve found with him?",mentalhealth
1697367611.0,Is there even a point to fight?,"I don't even know where to begin, i don't even know if i should even write all this, but my life as a whole just starting to make me sick. I'll write down my life story in short, if you want to read it, go ahead, and decide yourself if this shit even makes sense to continue.  
  
I'm a 27 male from a 3rd world country, i moved a few years ago to the Netherlands.  
  
Life with my parents: To start off, i was born from an unloving relationship, my parents wanted to prove to their parents, that they are mature and responsible enough to raise a child. Well, as it turns out, probably that couldn't be further from the truth. All my childhood since i could clean up my own shit i was left alone, maybe i was around 3. My parents were always working, being at a friends place, doing anything else but coming home. They left some food in the fridge from time to time, so i could eat, but most of the time they forgot, so i was eating what i could reach... flour, semolina, sugar, sometimes some vegetables and fruits what we had in the cellar. After i reached the age of 5, they only left money for me, so i had to buy everything for myself, i learned to cook some basic stuff. Starting from this point, they were fighting with eachother constantly, and they were always furious from either work, or from eachothers sheer stupidity, sometimes they tried to vent on me, so i ended up being beaten up almost on a dialy basis, because i couldn't defend myself. When i was around 6, i moved to Germany to my uncle, for about half a year, thoose were the happiest days of my life at that point, but unfortunately his wife died in a car accident, so I ended up back in my own country. When i reached 10 or 11 my parents divorced. I ended up being taken away by my mother, which was a really unfortunate outcome, she was way more agressive than my father was. Up until i reached the age of 14, i was beaten up daily for whatever reason, i was almost strangled to death on multiple occasions, some times i ended up blacking out as well. Some of the reasons included poor performance in school, or she got angry in work, or the wildest ones were when she was dating someone, and they break up with her. When i reached the age of 14 I moved away from home to a school far away from home and lived in a dorm. - When i was around 5 I had an accident, i was cycling with my parents, but i fell under a car, i'm still kind of concerned that it was their doing. I couldn't move for a while, my gall and liver ripped out from their place.  
  
Primary school life: I could never make friends, i never knew what i have to or how i have to talk to people. I never had one single friend in school... or my life. In the meantime while all this happened, i was bullied and beaten up in the school by students and teachers alike. When i reached the age of 13, i got tired of everything, i started beating up people as soon as they tried to get physical with me. The last years of my primary school was spent in either in the principals office, or in a police station. I broke multiple peoples arms, legs, ribs, teeth, etc. I had some bullies move to differrent schools i beaten them up so hard. In the end i got fired, and had to finish the 8th grade from home school. Ah yes and of course when i tried to speak to my parents about the bullying, they said it was my fault, and surprise, i got beaten up.  
  
Studies: I learned reading and writing when i was around 4 or 5 with a help of some school training program on the computer, i was bored out of my mind at home, we had no internet or PC games at the time, only books, and a TV with only 3 commercial channels avaliable. I believe up to high shool i basically learned everything from all the books we had until i was about 8. My parents still had their school books, we had a huge book series that kind of looked like a printed wikipedia. When i reached the age of school, i literally never studied, i slept through classes, it was boring, i already knew everything that they had to teach me. Since they bullied the heck out of me, a bunch of times i couldn't even finish my tests for all kinds of reasons. They broke my pen, ripped up my paper, once they stabbed me with a compass, etc.  
  
High school: After i moved far far away from my parents, i started to work in a factory or for the military, depending on which one needed help on specific weekend days, or afternoons in the school. During vacations i was working full shifts. My years in high school were kind of chill, i never made friends, but i already had a huge build from all the physical work i was doing, so no one dared to pick on me, they said i looked dangerous and socially distant. I found love after a year, she was the love of my life, we finished the school together, and moved together right after.  
  
Doctors and other shit: I was forced to visit doctors all the time, i was diagnostized with ADHD, Autism, and a lot of other mental shit.  
  
Love life: We were together for 8,5 years, i was helping her in everything, i helped her with money, she originally came from a really poor family. When we finished school we lived off my salary for about 1,5 years, because she couldn't find work in the area. After school, we got engaged, but eventually, she just packed her stuff, blocked me on everything, and left. She was my everything, i planned my life around her, we basically grew up together. This was 5 years ago.  
  
Work life: After school, I started off at a building engineering company as a simple salesman. The CEO quickly noticed that i was super smart, and i remembered almost everything about every product we had, and after the first month my probation ended, and i could do everything my own, i increased my departments sales by 10 times. After that point i got promoted as an Online Sales Manager, but they kept my salary incredibly low, despite the huge jump in responsibility. This went on for almost 5 years, but i gave up. They asked me to study law, which i did for 1,5 years, and we agreed that my salary will increase accordingly, this ofc. did not happened. I left the company, and since they did not knew how to operate everything what i had build during thoose years, they got into a huge lawsuit, loosing millions in the first few weeks after i left. After i left, i tried to look for something in my own country, but i gave up after 3 months.

  
I moved to the Netherlands, to try my luck. In the past 2 years I'vbeen moving from company to company, since they prefer polish people in every possible position where i worked so far. At the moment i would say i'm on a good place, but who knows.  
  
During all theese years, i never made a single friend, i could never recover from my ex, i never had my own dreams, i have nothing to work for, just my own survival. Since i'm in the Netherlands, I live with alcoholics, drug addicts, and criminals in a workers hostel. I don't know how to talk to people, i don't know how to make friends, i don't know how to find love again. I have no clear point in my life, but survival. I have to work to survive, to buy food.

  
I tried multiple hobbies, and they always gave me a boost, but after a while my interest died towards almost all of them.

  
I'm trying to loose some weight, by going to the gym, since i'm eating a lot of trashfood, and sweets, and sometimes it feels like thats my only way to increase my dopamine levels by a little. As soon as my dopamine levels drop all i'm thinking about is suicide. I have no clear image in my mind, i don't have anything that i want to accomplish, i wish i was a millionare so i can see the world, but i feel like i can't do anything to change anything. I feel like the only thing i can do is escape from my past and country, and live a miserable life in a faraway land, and be a slave for the rest of my life, without friends, love, or a place that i can truly call my home. Even just the thought of this makes me sick. My life is miserable and i feel like i can't do anything to change it, nor do i have the strenght to continue like this. I just want to end it all.

1697366721.0,Anyone else who was misdiagnosed with autism as a child?,"So, what happened to me is that I was diagnosed with autism when I was about 10 years old. The diagnosis never really felt right. Then when I was twenty, I asked for a re-assessment and the conclusion was that I did not have autism after all, which to me was a huge relief. 

I was wondering if there are other people who have been in the same situation? I would love to hear from you. I never really told any of my friends about the autism diagnosis, because people can start treating you differently because of it. And then when the autism diagnosis was removed, I still didn't tell them for the same reason. It would be nice to talk with other people who've had this same experience - online and anonymously.

Am I experiencing some form of depersonalization?,"As in the title, I feel like my self is a lie, that behind the sack of meat that is my body there is no true person. I feel like I'm a layer of contradicting masks, constructed to fit whatever personality is appropriate at the moment. But I can't peel the layers back, there is no source and i feel im lying to everyone every time i speak with them. I also barely remember most of my past, especially my childhood, it's just a garbled mess of hazy events that I mostly just know in the abstract. I know I went to school, but I barely remember being there. All I remember was feeling rejected, lonely, wrong and praying for death.

I think it was then, in 1st or 2nd grade, when I started hiding who I was, and now I can't remember who that was, maybe there's just nothing now. Usually I just chug along, not even realizing I lie, and doing things without thinking, going through the motions. But sometimes, it's like I snap back, and I feel like I'm watching a movie, like someone else is doing things while I'm a passenger in their head. There were times, in the past, where I looked in the mirror and wondered ""huh, so that's supposed to be me?"" 

And it makes me so fucking scared to be close to people, especially romantically. I mean, what can I give them if I'm nothing but a series of lies? Who would want to stay with someone that's nothing, just some mirage of an individual. I dread the idea of opening up, because I've only done that a select few times in my life, when I was at my absolute breaking point. I dread it because I've gotten used to this hiding and deceiving, and I don't know what else to do, I don't even know what side I'd show someone if they wanted to be with the ""real me"".

at first they gave me some undesirable things like maladaptive day dreaming, and severe hypomania.

he shows interest in making rap songs, and not too long ago, i realized some were about me. one of the lyrics had “hes just starin’ at it” “i dont want your love, you dont know what love is” and “you showed your true colors” which had me thinking a lot. i started thinking he thought i was attracted to his feet, but i swear i wasnt, i was too focused on not looking at him in a weird way that would make him think that. but why would he say im staring at it when in reality that was the very thing i tried to avoid? when by myself, i would video my eyes focused on one thing, while also trying to move it at the same time, but i would never really see my eyes move. i was talking with my step father 1 on 1 about how i thought my brother was making music about me, trying to “calm me down”. it was all good until he started showing intimidation. “oh shoot theres a cop right there, oh never mind, it’d be funny if i had friend who was a cop.” while he looked me as if i did something wrong. i felt as if he thought i did something pedophilic, which made me look nervous after what he thought about me, which just made my ass look guilty as fuck. my other brother, whod also shown interest in making music, would rap about “its sad, but ill get over it” “just like he know thats my girl, chill, chill, chill” “if he was like that id know he’d lie”. my biggest fear before all of this was people knowing i like feet, but now they think i like little kids? im living in a nightmare. after a year of this, i feel so use to it that i dont really show how much i care. our grandma recently just passed away, and i showed no emotion at her funeral, even though we talked everyday, and we were very close. at her funeral i was still very nervous showing up, hoping i dont act weird. me and my brothers took pictures together, and this one picture, taken on my moms phone, will haunt me for the rest of my life. my left eye was staring at the camera, the right at my brother. seeing it for myself, hoping i was the only one who saw it, i deleted it as fast as i could. to this day i feel very uncomfortable about it and never wanna be in public again, knowing i had a lazy eye and worst of all, it eases to something i really wish to not look at, which gets worse the more i dont wanna look at something. i wanna say that my eye problem started a year ago, when i would be too focused on something i didnt wanna look at, but again i didnt even know my eye was doing that, whilst my family thought i did it intentionally. after looking through reddit about ocd, i started thinking positive, but it makes me angry at the same time, because if it is ocd, no one could have made it as worse as it is than my own family. they had me thinking more and more i was actually a pedophile and incest, when all it really was was ocd(not diagnosed, i just believe it to be). they told me i was in a phycosis, my mother sent me to foster care, which i feel is gods way of giving me space away from them, giving me time to heal and think. in the end, when i do heal, i have no plans to keep in contact with my real family which is sad. id alway say the reason i live is to make my family happy, but now they think im a monster. suicide has been on my mind, no intent, i guess its just another intrusive thought. i have a lot more to live being 17, with alot of musical talents and ending it like this feels very unsettling. a tiny part of me is thankful im going through this, because i know it sure as hell made me more matured, knowing the only one who can make me happy is me, and i have to live with that mindset. the way i grew up makes me cringe at emo/edgy depressing comments, but now that im going through it, talking about how i really feel is hard. so sorry for this, but to this day, nothing makes me truly happy right now, which is me being depressed i guess, struggling with a lot of mental illness and anger. i want to get into boxing. i feel theres a lot i could do with my anger. all of my intrusive thoughts, but im never aroused except for female feet which i havnt really been as insecure as i was, compared to what my family thinks about me. i really do plan on getting help about my intrusive thoughts, since much is offered, being in foster care, the problem is just talking about it. after looking through what everyone has to say about other peoples problems, i feel i could find some info on here as to why i have these thoughts and why theyve gotten worse. i know i should just ask my therapist about it but i just want advice from other people who can support me instead of just laughing and seeing me as weak and digusting. please someone help me. give me advice and reassurance. it feels like im at my lowest and i really need it. 

I also only a few questions, if anyone can answer it, id appreciate it so fucking much.

1. Why does my lazy eye only look at things i try to not look at?
2. Why do i feel normal going through this? I do feel really hurt and disgusted and eat very little now, but i feel like i should be throwing up everyday, slowly killing my head and body.
3. I know i said i dont feel aroused by any of the intrusive thoughts, but why do you think theyve gotten worse?",mentalhealth

1697363189.0,I am emotionally drained.,"TW

Also I am not trying to self diagnose I just don't know how else to word these things in a way people will understand. 

I went through a very rough period in my life a few years back and only now am I coming to the terms with the fact that I was suffering a really bad depressive episode. I am not saying this is the reason but one of the many, prior to my depressive episode I lost many people I cared about, was dealing with my parents fighting most nights and coming to terms with childhood trauma that had come back to me. During this time I had planned out many attempts and tried to go through it once but life got in the way. Now I feel I am facing the after affects of coming out of the episode which I'm not even sure is a thing. I think these 'after affects' may be based on how I handled my episode since the only way I i could handle it was to mentally numb my emotions.

My depression ended in a numbed state where I didn't cry or feel sad for almost a year. During my depression I went through stages of numbness as well but it wasn't as bad as it was when my depression ended but to be honest I didn't care. I felt so happy I was glad I had numbed myself. Like I had forcefully removed the bad emotions and all I had left was some twisted version of happiness - euphoria more so. 

After that the new year started and both the depression and the numbness slowly disappeared but I was left to grapple having my real emotions back. For a while I was fine but fights I had had with my parents got worse and I decided I wanted to change so I found myself meeting new people. One of these people I formed a romantic attachment with but I was no where near ready for a relationship. They pushed me into a situation where me and the person were romantically envoled even though I didn't want it. 

I wasn't able to communicate this properly, however, and maybe it was a craving for attention or wanting to feel love for the first time in years, I went along with it. This lead to another downpour in my mental health where I was treating this person and others in my life really poorly through what I can only describe as a bad case of BPD or something similar. I would ghost and love bomb and start fights. My emotions would switch up really quickly and I was scared that even though I knew I was treating everyone badly, they'd leave me. 

I started to self harm again and my anger levels was getting out of hand. Eventually I think they got sick of me so even though we weren't dating as I specially asked not to label us, they sent me a 'break up' text. My mood swings and anger stayed for a while until I was finally done with everyone I had met. Only then did I start to feel as if everything was going back to normal. Sometimes I still experience pretty bad mood swings towards the people from my past. I want attention from them for a day then get annoyed when they want to keep in touch.

This all ended the start of this year and I finally thought I was getting back on track with my mental health until now. I have found my myself mirroring people's emotions, especially the when they are stressed or angry or sad and I feel so drained from it I cant even function. I don’t know whether its a coping mechanism or something what i just cant handle it. On top of that I fear I may have developed some sort of anxiety and I have a need to do everything right and even the slightest rejection or if I do something wrong and I am corrected, I end up holding in my tears and feeling an immense sadness. I have been experiencing random spikes in my anger, only narrowly catching myself before i physically and mentally hurt the people i care about. The slightest bit of rejection can set me off and I can feel heavily depressed for the next few days. I cannot go into more details because I honestly don't know how to explain it but I just feel so drained at the moment and I don't know what to do.",mentalhealth

1697359869.0,How do I stop my constant seperation anxiety? Need help.,"TW: Suicidal thoughts

Hello.

The last 3 weeks or so have been the hardest of my [20M] entire life. The person I love the most has gotten in to a relationship and I have had really bad depression, seperation anxiety, jealousy, and my libido and appetite have both been gone. I barely get enough sleep. I also got an anxiety attack a few nights ago. For context, I have autism, don't use any drugs or take any medication.

It has become so bad that when the gf of my friend joins or gets mentioned, I feel a ""bomb"" of anxiety exploding in my body. And my heart starts throbbing. 

In general for the past few weeks, I go to bed shaking and with a throbbing heart, barely sleep, and wake up the same way: with a throbbing heart. Throughout most of the day it stays, I just feel it throbbing constantly, and I even see my throat pulsing in the mirror. I also regularly think of suicide, I am however not in danger, as I will not act upon these thoughts.

How do I calm these symptoms? I imagine sooner rather than later it's gonna wreck my body. And how do I get my mind off of her when I constantly think of her? I'm heartbroken and lost. I don't want to cut ties with her because she is my world and only one of very few social contacts.

If you're reading this and any bit of advice comes to mind, please comment it. I am lost and need help really badly, my life is becoming unbearable.",mentalhealth

How are things in there? Is it as horrible as people say it is? Maybe i just don't want to admit that i can't do this alone cause i was always thaught to always do things myself and never ask for help, that i should be perfecto, do things the perfecto way, never making mistakes and everything in me is a mistake, how can i live a good life if i'm broken?

I have no desire to get a job other than the anxiety that seeps into every conversation when anyone who asks about my life. I am not dependant on weed but that is only because I can't smoke in my house and can only get it every few months. Every day I feel like my life is being wasted and im just waiting for death.

The only time I feel happy is the middle of the night since I have no remorse for wasting my nights away, since I can't work at night. I sometimes dream of being seriously hospitalized for months at a time so I don't have to feel guilty about not working.

1697358468.0,Stuck in limbo,"A quick fire background of myself, I have have mental health issues mostly PTSD and Depression. Tried to commit suicide in 2021 whilst in the military was given 10 weeks CBT and denied access to further treatment by the MOD so I left. My fiance told me to stop being silly with my mental health and can’t understand why I still have PTSD or bad mental health days since I have left the military. I support their view as we all deserve our opinions to be heard and understood. 

I am still suicidal and each time I think about it, I almost feel like I’m waiting on the train to come one day. But I have my first child on the way and I can’t commit suicide as my life insurance won’t pay out, this is vital to my child’s future and my fiancé as it’s sizeable at £500k. 

Along with this my fiancé dosent like sharing a bed with me and we sleep in separate rooms, she says it’s for her own benefit as I don’t sleep well and when I do I speak in my sleep and wake myself up with some of the memories I have. This has a effect on me as it plays on my mind why I am not good enough to be around but I also know it’s all my fault and it’s part of my journey struggling to come to terms that I am the issue. 

I went to the NHS for help and was told I’ll be on a waiting list which I understand is fair as there is others ahead of me who need more help, particularly those who aren’t comfortable with the idea of dying and have a harder time wrestling their mental health. I suppose I’m lucky I have accepted I’m hated and my passing has no impact in the world even for those close to me, seen people lose their life’s and a flag was all they came to be. 

I just wanted to vent as I can’t complain really I have accepted I’m beyond helping and I’m pushing to build wealth for my family when I pass. I just feel stuck in limbo that I know I’ll die and abit of me is still sad that I am not loved by my own fiancé anymore and I’ll never be the father to my child I want to be. All because I let the military mess my mental health and I’m the reason for my current situation.

1697357899.0,I’m stuck like this and I need help,"Hello to anyone who reads this, I hope your having a good day and am not experiencing what I am. 
Just as a background for this. For about 5 years now. Ive been in so many bad experiences that I’ve convinced myself it’s normal and to follow the mindset. “I’ll survive”. 
I’ve always been the guy that isn’t really the popular or guy that people end up crushing on. Im the guy who ends up like an older brother, there to help no matter what. A guy you can trust and talk to, so that you can find your way through a problem. But that makes it so that I’m not really the one who gets help. 
See I’ve been just beating myself up recently. All the people, my friends. Around me are all in happy relationships, not me. I’ve helped about 5 of my crushes now, get with their guy. Who just so happens to be my friend. I don’t sabotage them at all because I don’t want to manipulate anyone into anything. I just want them to be happy and it’s all I really care about. I don’t really get texted or spoken too much outside of when I usually see the people. Their friendly and I consider them friends. I have a shell around me that’s kinda like a mask that says I’m fine. Or I have no emotions are what some other people who don’t know me say. But to get to the point.
 Im lonely, it’s been getting to me. Ive grown deceptive of everything and I investigate everything as a habit now. I don’t feel included in anything. Some people who i think of as friends don’t invite me places, but I ignore it and invite them places anyways. They don’t text me, I can usually go about a week or two without being texted first by anyone. But I’ll live, all I have now is hope. Hope that things will get better. And I think in order for things to do that I need people who can maybe help me through this which is why I’m here. I’m putting my trust into people I’ve never met before, because I know people here can really bring back my hopes and dreams. 
I lost my hopes, dreams, ambitions to everything because of my mental health. I used to be a near 4.0 student, now I’m about a 2.8-3 . I don’t talk much verbally, I’ve lost my fears in things but at the cost of it’s because I just don’t care anymore. I still want to not be alone. But I also want to help people. Helping is what makes me feel included and needed and good. I feel good that people trust me and that I can really do something to help them get out of their depression or dark moments. 
I was in a car driving this girl home from a football game. I had a crush on her, but to her I’m a older brother. And she started crying. I ask her what was wrong, and she was questioning why anyone liked her and it broke my heart. And I had to explain to her every reason someone would like her. Then she brought up the guy she liked who was my friend. I was sad but I just wanted to help her get better. That’s the type of guy I am. 
People tell me I’m a guy who people just happen to feel trusted towards and I w always end up like a brother. 
But I want to also experience the things they do, I want love, I want to be invited places, I want to go on a date (I was cancelled on one the day of the date which would have been my first, I even got a haircut and expensive clothing and my parents were excited for me). But I also want to keep helping people. That’s all I can really think of, it’s 3 am right now and I haven’t slept. Sorry if I repeated anything, but thank you if you read this all. If you have any advice or just want to help I welcome it. I hope you have a nice day.",mentalhealth

My chest feels tight. Like I know what I want to say but it's stuck. Even now with complete anonymity and I still can't say what I want because of what people will think. How they would feel towards me even though you don't know who I am. I don't know if I want anyone to feel anything towards me. It's not like I don't want attention. I keep thinking am I doing this for pity. So  many contradictions in my head.,mentalhealth

This started a little under a month ago. I feel like it’s been getting worse since then. At first prior to this I felt like I was relatively okay, I was happy. When I think back on it now, I realize I really wasn’t as okay as I thought I was. Toxic positivity was kicking in and every time I failed a test or didn’t have a responsibility to my full potential, I’d convince myself that it was fine and that there was no need to stress over it and that it would make everything worse. As time goes on and I put low effort into things I find it becoming the only thing I do. “Oh, I have a test in two weeks? I’ll just study the last day before,” “Oh I didn’t get a good grade on the test because I studied very little? You did great it’s okay...” I’ve convinced myself that underachievement is totally normal. I find myself realizing that something is wrong.    
   
Fast forward towards now I find myself in weird sad moods, that move to happy moods, then back to sad moods, then back to happy. When I look at myself in the mirror my opinion changes each time, I see myself, “Beautiful,” “Ugly,” “beautiful.” It’s exhausting. I only don’t know what’s going on, it’s so scary. I find myself isolating myself more and more from the rest of my friends while only staying close to one because I have this nagging feeling they are talking about me when it’s probably not true. I think the scariest thing that I find myself uttering at random times is “I can’t do this anymore,” and then a random crying spell comes out of nowhere when I feel like in the first place there was no reason for me to be crying.

1697354134.0,Friends Forever,"A short story inspired by very real events

I met “Sarah” when we both joined an online mental health support group. From her profile picture, I could tell she’d been through a lot for a 36 year old. Sarah was bald, very overweight and she used oxygen. She also now had a bipolar disorder diagnosis and so did I (I was diagnosed in 1999).

I didn’t expect that Sarah would feel up to posting much, but she did, and she was wickedly funny. We hit it off right away. It wasn’t long before we exchanged phone numbers and soon we were chatting nearly every day. Often we’d FaceTime so we could see each other’s faces and share our lives.

We became so close so fast that I felt like I had known Sarah all my life. I learned that she had diabetes, an underactive thyroid, scarred lungs and she had beaten a battle with breast  cancer. I was amazed by her and her strength. I began confiding in her and it wasn’t long before I was planning a trip to her city.

One day Sarah didn’t show up to post in our support group, like she had every day. I left her several messages there and later tried her phone but got no answer. I figured she’d contact me when she had a moment.

Two days went by with no word from her. I got worried, but since I hadn’t visited, we’d met online and she lived about 1000 miles away from me, I hadn’t had a chance to visit. I had no one from her family to contact or any other friends who knew her.

I never heard from Sarah again. I missed her terribly and couldn’t quite believe she had ghosted me, but eventually of course I went on with my life

Three months later, I got a call from a strange number. I don’t usually answer those, but this time something (God?) told me to answer. It was a woman who asked my name and then asked me if I knew her daughter Sarah.

I told her absolutely I did and that I was so glad she’d called because Sarah and I had lost touch. I asked her how she had gotten my number and she told me from Sarah. She then started crying and my heart fell to the floor.

“Sarah’s cancer has come back, hasn’t it.” I was so upset that I started shaking.

“No. Sarah died by suicide a month ago,” her mom finally choked out. 

I was stunned. I couldn’t form words. Sure, Sarah and I were both bipolar, and had talked about her other illnesses too, but she was so strong and funny and friendly!

I said, “I thought you told me Sarah had given you my number.” She said, “she did, in a roundabout way. I found it in her phone when I got it back from Verizon and got access to it. I read through your messages and realized you were a close friend.” I confirmed I was and gave her a brief rundown of our friendship.

She then said, “Please tell me about my daughter.” 

I spent the next hour and a half telling her everything her daughter and I had shared. We both cried. There were a lot of things she didn’t know about her life in recent years (after all, Sarah was 36 and living on her own). 

As Sarah’s mental health apparently declined,  she had withdrawn from her family. I was completely surprised because Sarah told me she was close to her family. Plus she was always smiling and funny and upbeat when we spoke or FaceTimed. Her mother explained to me that Sarah had always hidden the worst parts of her mental and physical illnesses and she had even died quietly by overdosing on her insulin.

She told me, “we do have reason to believe she tried to change her mind at the last minute. She was found with an unlit cigarette in her mouth just steps from the outside door to her apartment building. We think she was going to ask someone for help by getting a light from someone outside and asking for help. But her blood sugar bottomed out and she collapsed.”

I was so heartbroken when I hung up the phone. I couldn’t believe that such a vibrant soul was gone from the world. I couldn’t believe that my life had been touched by suicide when I myself was bipolar and also a crisis counselor. 

I decided I needed to do something, anything to remember her by. At that time I ran a Facebook page called the Empathetrix on which I posted my inspirational collage art for my 16,000 followers. I decided to do one for Sarah. It depicted a little girl headed towards a white light with a backpack on that says,”I am in pain.” Nearby an angel statue weeps and the flowers are wilted. Sarah ran for that, whatever it is; I’m still not sure. But I’m sorry, Sarah. I wish I’d known.",mentalhealth
1697353833.0,Can deppression make you tired?,"My mental health has been going downhill for whatever reason for a while. That being said, especially the past few weeks I've been really tired.
Even the nights I sleep very well, I'm drowsy waking up. Other things that have happened with my sleep are that:
-I can't get sleep after 9.00 anymore (I can nap, but no actual sleep. And that's uncomfortable too) (this is very annoying concidering I want to sleep ALL THE TIME BECAUSE I'M TIRED
- Whenever I'm tired, it's still a gamble whether I'll be able to drift off. Sometimes I have to get up and wait for a few hours, so it's like 2.00-4.00, until I can actually get any sleep

Thoughts?

Also, anything that could help me with this? I'm taking magnesium, but if there's any other things that coule help me with my sleep I'd apprecciate it. I also don't use electronics past 10 ( I usually go to sleep at around 11)",mentalhealth

busted through the wall with a shot glass in his hand. Scream  ""TAKE THE SHOT"" . I took the shot. Many times went to school absolutely shit-faced. Reached out for help, didn't want to touch it. High school=difficult. Grades dropped to nothing. I had zero respect. Commit injustice towards me, I was on a vindictive path towards you and yours. Fought others to protect friends.

Friends no longer associate with me because I dropped out
Went back 3X. Graduated 21.

 Still wanted to be loved and I still loved. I still cared. Too far wrapped up, take on others emotional. Drunk in the kitchen floor off cheap whiskey. Incredibly depressed. Unmotivated, no ambition no imagination. Essentially a shell.
 My friend realized and helped me/forced me? Out of the relationship, in a really fucked up way. I was told if I do not get in a relationship with him he would refuse to be my friend. Only person I had left, could not let him go. I told him that he is making a mistake, and that I am a incredibly difficult individual to be around. Told him he would regret it.
We are still together. 
Life was fantastic, 2 years. Damn near perfect. Going the way I had imagined. Still struggled, not as severe. Outlook was better, colors brighter. Trauma happened.

Shortly it's May 5th, Getting better. Calming down.
Work in a warehouse taking pictures of clothing and putting it online. I get to work on May 5th 2023 at 7:25am. Go on break at 9:58a, pass a guy on the stairs in blue jeans, a hoodie, work boots and a hat. Think nothing, even say ""excuse me"". Looked like he belonged. One of us. Then I heard the gunshots.
 He ******* my boss and himself. She had broken up a month before, kidnapped her 2 weeks before that day. 60 seconds has ever felt so staged. Everything changed.


 May 5th - October 14th
3 ish weeks later, think I was her? Pretty sure I existed, but Deja Vu daily, unsure and doubtful  if I was in the right area or the right time. I broke. Days I couldn't speak. I couldn't form full sentences. 
Distraught. Body trying to rip apart, exist on multiple planes. Disassociated, shackled to myself. Went back to work for almost a week. Everyday a panic attack. Had to fight me to go inside.
 I forgot how to take pics, could 't comprehend typing. Listing rate from 42 a day to 6. Intense Emotional outbursts. Like the wrath of a terrible god at work, home. Brother started hanging out at our place. 
Anger was rage, the power of hell behind it. It would be lit by anything at any time. Completely over the top. Like a flash fire. Instantaneous, hot as the Sun.
Everyone was a victim. Caught in flame. Lashed out, burning everything and everyone. Used what I knew to tear you apart. We fire took over,  I was pushed backwards, forced to watch it destroy. No power, no control over this monster. 
Shattered into pieces every day. At night I put myself back together. 
Sometimes last for a couple hours, sometimes days. Anger subsided, was exhausted, cannibalizing myself. Feelings of extreme guilt and shame. Couldn't live up to my own extreme expectations; hated myself. I was fallible, susceptible. Mortal.
Couldn't accept it.
 Struggled a month. Watched my life burn to the ground. Brother and I got high. Different kinds. Not sure what I did or didn't do.I feel bad for saying no, wil give him everything he wants just to avoid a fight. Neglected my everything. Health, hygiene everything. Became impulsive, participating in risky behaviors. Overindulgent with everything. Philosophy losophy became, ""I will do what I want"". No care for anyone else, consideration and empathy, gone. Bullshit threshold screwed.
 Current relationship almost ended ( financial stuff that had also happened in that time frame.)


 A month since I kicked brother out. Something said ""Enough""  I'
Not sure what snapped me out. A switch was flipped. Currently  working w/m therapist, specialist EMDR. 
Seen him a few times. Therapy is exhausting. It hurts. From years ago. Stuff I never worked through/out.
Once a week. Every session, I feel everything. Same feeling, Same pain. Years apart. After, I'm numb. No energy to feel.


Currently struggling with anger, fear. Recall memory falling. Response time delayed, info comp speed slowed. Feel confusion, difficulty doing tasks. Lose focus,lose thought. Intense need for organization, to my standard. I have terrible nightmares,wake up fighting. (Prazosin can't remember nightmare but feel the effects)
Paranoid, world is out for me. Waiting for life upended. This is not my universe/not my world.
 Waiting for the other shoe.
Feel as a mimick/chameleon. Different hats/suits for specific situations. Think emotional states put on at any time, but ca to remove. A back seat view me dealing with whatever.
I feel ike a puzzle with no outline. I have the pieces, but I don't have a reference of what it's supposed to be or where they go.
Being Underwater,  murky and thick. RInging in my ears,  far away and high pitched


I feel extreme guilt. For my boss, my coworkers. Failed in being the defender, the saviour. Blinded and could not see a threat right in front of my face. Guilt For every time I had an episode or internal fight . Guilt for being. Shame, worthless. Not enough, never will. Hyper self-critical, beat myself down.
Feel 5 mindsets here with me. A child, a caregiver, a trickster, a numb individual, a demon/pure destruction. 
Myself, single weed in the side walk. Resilient and just ""being"".


Body full of tar,  thick, non-moving. Difficult to breathe.
On edge. Wound too tight. Tightrope walker.
Not comfortable in my skin. Consciousness forcibly transferred 'here and now'. An imposter. A chameleon.
 Became cynical, pessimistic, angry. Hate people. Need connection. Love to help, hate to resent. Blame myself, critize. Tear my self down.
A perpetual Victim. The Victimizer and The Rescuer. I get angry at myself,being weak. Everyday, I'm crazy, am an idiot. Should have known better. Should have been smarter. Hate for anxious, depressed. Am chaos incarnate, existence meant for unpredictable disaster.
A sandstorm in my head, never stops. Buildings far out few.
 Can't grasp recent ideas or memories. Intelligence is waning. I   Intuition works. Sixth Sense for danger. Doesn't tell me when, where, who, what, why. Cant see immediately in front. See  hazard three blocks away, not the hole a foot in front of me. Naive. 
A walking contradiction. Disorganized Perfection. Intelligent and stupid. Kind and hateful. Need connection, hate people.


 At times, I  have complete clarity. Able to breathe. OG me freed
I don't know who that is. How to tell. Its pulled beneath the surface, and it's gone. I am stuck in fog with a terrible and familiar monster.
Tired and exhausted. Trying to understand if it's real. 
Mind is racing a million miles an hour, abrasive, hurts to obtain information. 


I think I know who I WAS. An empathetic, kind, deeply caring, person who yearned for emotional connection and physical  touch/Love.

1697352894.0,Having suicidal thoughts and questioning my worth,"I hate talking about this publicly but my family doesn’t believe in mental health and I just really would appreciate some advice.

i’m currently 16 and just started my junior year. I’ve had anxiety, socially and generally for as long as I can remember, but since high schools started it’s spiraled for me. This year specifically has been kicking my ass. Classes and everything, sure; but the lack of people, friends,  I have in my life for emotional support has been getting to me. My dad doesn’t support my anxiety; i’ve taken medication and therapy in the past and he doesn’t think I have it, that i’m over dramatic. Depression has also developed strongly for me since freshman year, but since last year I find myself thinking about ending my life as a passing thought more frequently. I cry almost every school night because I don’t want to deal with my classmates nor the stress of being there. I don’t have anything to look forward to, so why should I go?
The thing is, I got with my current boyfriend 3 months ago. It’s been absolutely wonderful and he’s a joy to be with, and a ray of sunshine in every sense. He’s super happy go lucky, never really upset or anything, all in all he’s just positive for himself and those around him. Me being the opposite has made me question my worth. Every argument we have I sob in fear that this won’t turn out. My codependency on him has made me so unstable. He makes me so happy, but without him I feel empty. It’s not healthy. I want to change, but I have no source to, I don’t know how. It makes me a problematic partner and I hate it because I want to be the best I can be for him. He’s aware of all of my issues but this is still a neverending stressed for me.
IMy dad has been especially on me for a lack of a job. For clarification im a straight A student and just dropped out of APUSH because I was so overwhelmed with stress. He’s been on me ever since, and when I tell him I need to focus on my academics he just yells at me and ignores the fact I also have major anxiety. I never vent to him about anything anymore because I know I’ll get yelled at.
This is so much. If anyone could give a few reassuring words I’d be eternally grateful. Im just lost and questioning if I should be here. I have no sources of comfort so Im looking to here.",mentalhealth

There was a time where it happened for 5 hours straight and I was up till 8 am sobbing and crying and my mom stayed up with me till then not sure what to do. My cousins would try to help me calm down because  these voices would come at random times and it would freak me out a lot, there was a time I went outside shopping and these voices suddenly started again and I started freaking out and panic crying to the point my dad was trying to rush back home in the car and I kept on sobbing in the car freaking out. I would watch a lot of horror movies uncensored because my whole family was a horror lover but they did warn and tell me not to watch it at that time since I was a child but I was stubborn and refused to listen to what they'd tell me. I think it may have been environmental? Because the last time I experienced these voices was when I was 15. These voices would get really bad telling me to do extremely awful things and practically force me but I knew I couldn't because I had good tolerance to handle it tho there would be time where I'd hold my head in my hands begging it to stop.

1697352117.0,I'm not sure what happens... wondering if someone has a clue,"Hello everyone, I'm posting because I genuinely don't have another idea... I've asked around for advice but people tend to just look at me as if I'm crazy. I'm a freshman collage student, and I've never exactly had good experiences with school, it's always linked to Incrediblely bad memories... it started off early on in elementary school.  I'm not sure if this is connected to what I'll mention next, but there have been some moments I can't fully understand or explain, and people don't seem to understand when I tell them. One of the earliest to provide as an example was when I was ten, It would feel like seconds that I was sitting at the desk, staring into the faux wood design on the surface before fingers would snap in front of me, the ""seconds"" would turn out to be several minutes. I was diagnosed with ADHD early on, but some things that happened later I'm not sure follow it- not really asking for medical advice more so just a clue on where to even get ideas for what's happening. One time when I was around 7, I was at recess and there was this bug on the ground- I picked this isopod up and held it... before I knew it a teacher grabbed be by my arm yelling at me, apparently I had sat there bug in hand for an hour and the class had left me. But I didn't have a single clue time had passed that much, infact I didn't understand why she was so angry. Events weirder than this happened later down the line, I had a 504 in middle school given my severe ADHD... so I carried my entire book bag everywhere I went regardless of schools policy's. One day after lunch I had forgotten literally everything I needed in the cafeteria, so I went back for it. The moment I picked up my back pack I realized... I didn't know where I was going, who's class I was going to, I was completely and utterly clueless. Halfway through the entire school year, I suddenly didn't have a clue where I needed to be. I went to the office and nervously got there attention.. I told them I was lost. They just... stared at me, eventually one asked me what class I had during that time. I nervously said I didn't know, they next asked for my teachers name. I stuttered as I realized the fact I didn't have a clue, I knew before- I knew this information before but it deserted me completely... The only thing I could think to do is apologize as I repeated ""I'll remember"" A few times. The staff member must have seen my face because she asked for my name next. I gave her my name close to tears not having a clue what was happening and why this information had left me. She searched my schedule and eventually I was on my way to the class having missed a full 30 minutes of class. For years it didn't happen again, at least from what I remember... but recently it did occor for another 2 times. I was going to math class, and suddenly I froze in the hallway as the realization hit me, I didn't know where I was going- I knew it was math class... but not the location, I had been to this class for almost 2 months now, 3 days a week. I knew this information but for some strange reason I suddenly didn't have a clue besides it was in this building I stood In. I didn't move, I stood contemplative untill I heard my professors voice from next to me
""Hey, is everything alright?"" She looked confused to see me standing in the center of the intersecting hallways, I turned to her replying ""Where is your classroom?"" 
She looked even more puzzled at my question
""My classroom?"" 
I nodded feeling confused and lost on why I didn't know
She looked concerned as she said ""I'm headed there now, follow me""

I nodded replying
 ""I think so... sorry I guess it's just... a lot on my mind...."" 
It had been a stressful week, but this had not happened for years to my knowledge, it had been almost 4 at least. The most recent and last time it happened was as I entered an elevator, I got in and the doors closed, not a second passed before they opened again, I was on the same floor as before- I was puzzled as I exited the elevator, why didn't it go up? Had I always been alone? Was there someone else before with me? I stood on the first floor unsure before I was approached by staff questioning me, I told them the elevator didn't appear to be working.
I was utterly confused when he tried it, making it to the floor I ment to go to... had the split second I looked down to my feet been longer? Did it really go up to my floor? I kept telling myself that maybe it was just bad luck and the sensor went off... but the question that I hadn't been alone plagued me, did I space out? I was there and then, a second passed- am I just crazy?!
 These types of things haven't happened Incrediblely often from what I know... I know it's not like I'm Dory from finding Nemo... but if and when it does happen it's incredibly difficult and scary. I'm unsure what to do as anyone I've asked doesn't really pay the matter mind or think anything of it.  However when these things happen it can cause major disfunctions of my day and even panic attacks. If anyone has an idea if this is something everyone experiences or if anyone thinks maybe they have somewhat of a clue why this happens It would be incredibly appreciated! Just a concept would make it easier to know what steps need to be taken for this, or possible options at the least. Thank you to those who take the time to read this!",mentalhealth

1697330451.0,How to overcome morbid jealousy,"Hello

I am a morbidly, chronically jealous. This is not in the context of a relationship and I need that to be made clear. It mostly exists in terms of self-actualization/ career.

I'm trying to learn why. Apparently I feel theres something that lacks within. OK. Now what?

I am doing shadow work journaling and there's like a mental block when it comes to jealousy and memories of being jealous. Perhaps there's trauma there. Now what? Seriously, these observations are almost unhelpful.

Should I try hypnotherapy to get to the source of it? Should I meditate? Have these helped for you?

Thanks. This has ruined my life long enough.",mentalhealth

I am feeling lost and in need of help. I don't know if I am depressed or not. My family, friends, and girlfriend don't believe that I am. I just moved to Canada as an international student five months ago. However, I am from a not-so-rich family and my dad took loans to get me here.  
  
When I first arrived, everything felt like sunshine and rainbows. But as time passed, everything started to feel bland and black and white. It started slightly towards the end of 2021, where I lost interest in all my hobbies, including playing video games and soccer. Even story games feel like a chore now.  
  
Currently, I feel really hopeless. I don't know what I want to do or what I want to become. I have no energy for anything and don't have any hobbies. Sometimes I get bursts of energy, but it dies away too soon. Everyone around me says it's my problem, and I need to get myself fixed. I spend too much money now, eat too much, and have gained 22 kilos in 23 months. I sleep too much at the wrong time and can't sleep at night when I need to do anything. I become too lazy to do anything and procrastinate a lot.  
  
For the last couple of weeks, I have been laughing out of nowhere. And it's not even a happy laugh. I know how messed up I am, and it feels like I'm laughing at myself. I feel like a complete loser who can't achieve anything. I am really lost and don't know what to do anymore.

Sometimes I wish I didn’t have that access but I also don’t at the same time. I cannot go a day, or sometimes even an hour or two, without thinking about something sexual.

The event ""ended"" this year and lasted for over 2 years. Ended is in quotes because it's not truly over, it's only lessened. I don't feel like I'm living in it physically as much, but I still am. Mentally, even more.


Talking about it at therapy makes me dissociate and lose track of time until the next appointment. Talking about it hurts so much. I can barely talk or think about it without crying and mentally checking out for days or weeks or months depending on how bad it is.


The event left me:

-Not wanting to wake up

-Depressed

-Insecure with myself as an individual, my relationship with this person, and the world around me

-Shattered all my self-confidence and made me internalize that I truly am ugly, unloved, and unwanted

-Scared to go outside and be seen by anyone

-Unable to listen to music anymore, unless I want to be triggered and dissociate for the rest of the week

-Feeling so hopeless with everything in life as this person knew all of this was happening and let it continue due to their pre-existing relationship (which is now over and why it isn't as bad anymore)

Now that I am older (25), they are still the same just better at hiding it. I don’t feel mentally right anymore. I am angry at the world, depressed as fuck, I refuse to let anyone close, anxiety attacks, and my physical health has declined rapidly. 

For context; my narcissist parent gas lighted me my entire life, played way too many manipulation games on me, put me through “tests” such as; they would play music 🎶 and encourage me to dance 💃 just to turn it off a few minutes later and tell me “you see, you’re a whore. You wished you lived like a dancing whore. You act like a saint but you’re a whore” or she would encourage me to make friends just to pick them apart, insult them and burn it all down in front of my eyes. This was my constant lifestyle. So I had to learn to suppress every emotion & I felt myself die. My spirit is physically dead. Im a walking bag of meat with no emotions. I have no friends, no actual contact to the outside world other than the “internet” where I just watch movies because it still gives me a sort of imagination that she cannot destroy. She now plays mind games that I am too tired to even play. She’s been constantly egging me on to get a boyfriend and to make friends and to enjoy life, but I know that the second I do, she’s going to destroy those relationships right before my eyes as she has done because it makes her feel content to watch me in pain. I refuse to let my mom do this again to me, even if it means I will die alone. I cannot put more people through that. 

I feel mentally ill due to the fact that I hate humanity with a passion. I hate being alive. I hate myself so much and I wish I could not be afraid of dying because there’s literally nothing for me in this world.  I hate how I look. I hate that I am such a fucking coward. I hate everything about me. I would really like to see myself just die. I overcame a severe drug addiction without anyone knowing about it and sometimes I wish I hadn’t.

I have a lot of different skills. I'm starting to realize that I learned all of those skills so I could show other people and they could get impressed.

First of all, I am here if anyone out there is struggling with suicidal thoughts or you just need someone to talk/vent to. Been there. The whole world has felt dark and like all the colors were missing.

I have noticed a major cycle I do. I do not know what is ""wrong"" with me, but I have this cycle of meeting people > having great moments and having fun together > gets a little serious/too close > I panic and leave/ghost > feel relieved for a few months > circle back around to them... then it repeats all over again.

I have fallen deeply in love with someone and still left them and broke their heart when everything was going amazing. I do use marijuana to numb a little and I have a history of substance abuse. I only drink socially, but use it as a crutch sometimes, too. I am insecure with every little thing about myself and I don't trust many people/slight social anxiety, but working on it. I will edit something a hundred times and stay up for hours - I am always editing my entire life, but I don't think it stems from perfectionism it's more like doubt. It is never ending and I am exhausted.

There is constantly a tennis match and a seesaw/teeter totter going on in my head. Does anyone know a term for this? I know I will ask a mental health professional, but  does anyone know if this a symptom of any particular mental health condition? Thank you.",mentalhealth
1697341238.0,Help supporting husband,"Hi, so my husband and his dad have always been extremely close. My FIL is the one who raised my husband. Well Thursday night my FIL tried to commit suicide and although they were able to revive him in the ER, my husband is still really mentally messed up about it, understandably. I know the feeling because I went through something similar with my sister but it was 10 years ago and everyone is healed and healthy at this point. He probably needs therapy but I’m afraid it’s too soon to try to talk to him about that. What are some things I can do to help support my husband as he navigates this really traumatic time?

1697341133.0,My parents will never fully love me,"Yet another reminder of how my parents will never fully love me.

One of the biggest examples is when I was in suicidal depression- they told me I was lying for attention, and to get out of skipping my finals (I skipped because the score wouldn't matter obvs).

Everything's my fault. They assume the worst out of me. I'm tense around them and sometimes hypervigilant bc they only point out the mistakes or bad things I do and I'm waiting for more negativity. And rarely point out the good. It's true I spent most of my life lacking direction and giving up, but as an adult I'm driven and working hard to accomplish things. It doesn't matter- they don't see it.

I feel like such shit about myself all the time.

They can do nice things too, and they have done several caring things for me. But there's been so much negativity in the relationship, it doesn't outweigh this, it has affected me a lot. For years I've carried some of the bigger stuff they've said to me and I think about it near-daily.

1697340522.0,i want to give up - TW//$u!c!d@l thoughts/SH/ED,"I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for years. I’ve had anxiety for a lot longer than depression, and I spend most of my days feeling uneasy. 

I’m a freshman in college and I’ve finally escaped my parents’ control, but I still feel like they still have me in a chokehold. They’ve always tried to control my schedule and diminish my feelings. It was very much a “no feelings” household and they never seemed all that interested in how I felt. Whenever I’d try to talk to them, my dad would tell me to go exercise, my mom would say she can’t sit there and listen to me complain, and my sister would just dismiss me. My mom basically instagram stalks the account of the club I’m in, and she texted me asking me if I went (I didn’t). I lied and said I went to one event cause I knew she’d me on my ass, but that I didn’t go to the other. She then interrogated me and asked what shoes I wore (cause she could see the shoes of people in the picture) and I could clearly tell she was upset with me. She then stopped answering my texts all together.

Right now, I feel like I’m suffocating. I feel a weight in my chest like I can’t get a breath in and I can’t focus on anything else. Yesterday, my dorm roommate and my mom basically tag-teamed me while I was on the phone and made fun of me for having no friends and that I never leave the dorm. So, I’ve plummeted deeper into my already existent depressive episode.

So, that’s why I didn’t go to the two events with my club today. I couldn’t drag myself out of bed. I didn’t want to leave, or eat, let alone GO to an event at eight in the morning. And I didn’t. I’m starting to lose interest in all my hobbies and I never want to wake up. But I can’t tell my parents this. They still basically refuse to even acknowledge that I’m diagnosed with generalized anxiety and moderate to severe depression. I’ve never felt comfortable sharing my feelings with them, cause they either never listen or they make me feel ashamed. 

So, I learned to deal with everything in isolation.

I resorted to SH and that was how I found comfort. I would starve myself to feel some sort of control, and when I lost a lot of weight, my parents even PRAISED me. I felt that my value only extended to what I could “accomplish.” I also started cutting myself and other forms of self harm. It was the only way I could find comfort in how much pain I felt. Talking to people about my feelings wasn’t an option. Over the years, I’ve hurt too many people with my mental health, and so many people left me because I was too much for them. I feel disgusting about how I feel, and I feel nothing but shame for my depressive episodes.

Now that I’m at college, I expected it to be so good for me. That I would find peace now that I was away from my parents, but my depression followed me. For the past two weeks, I haven’t left my dorm for anything but classes. Occasionally, if I was already out, I’d pick up food. And I never want to leave my dorm to get food, so I either eat in my dorm or I don’t eat at all. On good days, I would go down once to get lunch. I just don’t have an appetite, and when I do, I don’t have the motivation to get food or make food. So, I’ve noticed I’ve lost more weight, but I’ve started finding comfort in it. Like I still have some control.

Last night, something in me broke. My two month long streak of being SH free was thrown out the window. I gave up. I felt too overwhelmed with my feelings and all my friends left for the mid-semester break, and now I’m here all alone for five days. I feel isolated again. Seeing everyone having fun with their friends and family at home made me feel so out of place.

I always feel out of place. Even when my friends are here, they never want to hang out. So, it’s not really like it’s any different from the past three weeks. I started thinking again if anyone would even care if I existed.

I never even planned out a life this long. I don’t know where it’s heading. It’s too overwhelming. I don’t want to feel this way anymore, and I’m so tired of pretending like everything’s okay. 

I just want to give up on it all.

I don’t know what to do.",mentalhealth
1697318360.0,feeling anxious for seemingly no reason??? need help,"hi everyone first reddit post here but I really need advice and i've reached breaking point. I (24F) have really been struggling with managing my anxiety and depression since about August of this year - so about 2/3 months. I've struggled throughout my entire life but I got into my first serious relationship over a year ago with my boyfriend (24M), he's lovely, on paper everything is absolutely perfect, he treats me well, he's extremely supportive, he makes me laugh, he treats me like a princess, he's essentially every woman's dream man, he's made a lot of mistakes surrounding his exes that I won't go into too deeply (he's never cheated or anything, just things such as hanging on to gifts that have in turn hurt my feelings and going into depth about his sexual history) but he's apologised time and time again and he's working hard to regain my trust. Over the last couple of months I almost feel like I've lost feelings for him and I've been left so confused because he's everything I want and sometimes I feel like he's the love of my life and I'll be looking at engagement rings and picturing a future with him and the next minute I just feel nothing but crippling, stomach churning anxiety. I've been through a lot over the last year - with relationship stress, I lost my dog and my parrot (both of which I've had since I was a kid) within a month of each other, my relationship with my emotionally abusive dad broke down and I haven't spoken to him in under a year while still living in the same house, I've begun SH again after being clean for 10 years and attempted unaliving and I left my job due to quickly building stress and I'm on a 6 month long waiting list for a therapist so I'm on my own - so I'm unsure if this is something that's played a part? I feel so lost, part of me wants to leave him to see if the pain will stop and part of me doesn't want to lose him. I feel like I've got nothing left because he was one good thing I had and now it feels like its crumbling around me. We are on vacation right now and I've spent most of it sobbing.

1697339610.0,ADHD? OCD? What can it be?,"There is a chance that I may have ADHD. I hate self-diagnosing but honestly this is me just surrendering because it hurts my ego I'm 22M and it's hard for me to explain some of these symptom's because these are my norms so I find it hard to distinguish what MIGHT be considered ADHD vs what's normal. I've already made an appointment to go speak to a psychiatrist about my potential OCD (99% sure I also have that) and will bringing this up as well. Some of the symptoms that make me think that I may have ADHD are 1st, I tend to procrastinate a lot for example, I go to sleep telling myself ""I have to study tomorrow"" then the next day as I'm typing this I haven't studied at all and it's about to be 10:00pm, I can't stay still while seated I have to physically move my legs or hands just to release something and feel good. Always chasing dopamine, eating sweets and even wearing headphones 24/7 just to stimulate myself (except at work and that's because they don't allow headphones). When it comes to school lectures I always get distracted within 5min and start daydreaming (I daydream a lot) I went to math tutoring and while the teacher was tutoring me I caught myself pretending like I'm listening and while I understood everything he taught me I did ask him to repeat himself many times because of my lack of focus. This was also a problems in high school which lead me to have super bad grades and eventually drop out. It's just weird, I've started and finished chapter books before, I have a good reputation at work. My only problem at is work is that I catch myself going back and forth to places gathering stuff that I need in order to finish my work a lot instead of getting everything I need in one go. Honestly, life has been so exhausting. I preform pretty good at work but when I get home I have a very hard time starting what I need to. I'm starting to hate myself because I keep lying to myself over and over about the things that I need to complete. Another major symptom I have is that I tend to change ""Phases"" every few weeks/months. For example, I wasted so much money trying to learn guitar, I went and bought a pretty expensive acoustic guitar, bought lessons online and practiced so much just to drop it the next month and that's pretty much what I've been doing for a while. Picking subjects up and dropping them after I've spend so much money. Anyways, I know no one here can physically help me but I had to rant.",mentalhealth

I went down a rabbit hole of reading about psychology, and I realised that I possess quite a few dark triad traits (I know it's the dark tetrad now, but sadism doesn't really apply to me so I'm ignoring it). Like I was reading about it, and realised that I display some of these traits pretty frequently. I will say it's mainly machiavellism, but there's definitely a bit of psychopathy and narcissism in there too.

I don't really know what to think, as in general I'm a nice person, but when I think about it, I do manipulate people a lot (not necessary maliciously), and i'm pretty apathetic to tragedy. It seems to me like in the past year or so these traits have developed, and they are slowly worsening.

This summer, I had a job that involved a lot of sitting around doing nothing, as I was supervising, but there wasn't much to do. To occupy the time, I spent probably like 5-6 hours a day all summer creating a plan to completely take over the world. I know this seems crazy but it was incredibly in depth, with every step outlined. I'm not gonna get into too much detail, but it would take about 2.5 years to implement, and whoever executed it would have complete control and influence over everyone. Every government, all the ressources, everything. At the end of the summer I thought to myself ""this is crazy"" and threw it out.

1697333438.0,Feeling stuck when I should be having the time of my life,"(TLDR down below) 

Hi. I'm 25 (F) with depression/anxiety/ADD/bipolar and two years ago I moved out of the country to pursue a masters degree in a field I've always dreamt of pursuing. The course didn't go to plan and I basically flopped my final project. Passed, but not with something I'm proud of. During that time I also got into a relationship with a man who's from the city I moved to and he turned out to be very abusive and ended up physically hurting me at the end of it. 

I had a rough handful of months after that ended and couldn't even stay awake for most of the days that I wasn't doing drugs. Couldn't find a job or even maintain a strong connection with my own reality. Things started to turn around and I found a job in the service industry (something I always have done) and also found a great group of friends. I still couldn't help but feel like I was experiencing life outside of my body and my control. I have had awful experiences in dating since I got out of my abusive relationship and experienced some severe heartbreak at the hands of \*genuinely\*  narcissistic men (I don't throw that word around lightly). 

I ended up having to come home for a month because I reached a breaking point and decided to see a  new psychiatrist who prescribed me some new meds and new diagnoses (ADD & Bipolar). It's now the end of that month and I'm going back but I can't help but feel like I'm not supposed to live there anymore. Both of my parents have mentioned they would like to see me move back sometime soon and it makes me feel guilty for living so far away. I was packing today and my mom just stood at the door and watched me while she teared up.

I feel like moving back would be a setback. It would be an immense failure for me - and I would miss my friends. I don't really relate to my friends from home anymore and feel like I would slow my personal and career growth process if I did come back. Where I'm from doesn't have many opportunities for what I want to do. I think it would really send me into a deep depression but on the other hand,  I feel like I need to tackle my mental health because I've always tried and shove it under the rug to avoid having to move back home. When I was in highschool I was admitted for telling my therapist that I was going to unsubscribe from life after I left our session. I quickly backpeddled when I talked to the doctors and social workers at the hospital when I realised I would likely be sent to inpatient care. I wish I didn't because high school was probably a way easier time to start life over again after inpatient care while I still lived under my parents dime and roof. 

Mental healthcare is not really an option where I live and I would like to be near my family and the comforts of home if I were to admit myself.  


 A lot of people have told me how cool they think my life is and I feel like everyone would be dissapointed if I were to just give it all up because where I'm from, not a lot of people leave the country, let alone the state. I just want to know if any other people on here have experienced this kind of struggle of having to take a step back in a period of their lives when they should be experiencing live to the fullest. I'm in my mid-twenties, living abroad and have really cool and genuine friends that I love and love me. I want to keep living abroad - but I also miss my family, my dogs, and the comforts of home. I feel like time is slipping away and I'm missing a lot of big life events. I feel stuck. I have half a mind to miss my return flight. My visa isn't up until January of 2025 and up until I came home I always thought I would live abroad for at least another 5-10 years. 

**TL;DR:** I don't want to set myself back by moving back home and dealing with my mental health for real this time. I just need some words of encouragement to move forward or some insight from people who made the decision to move back home (whether it was from abroad or not) and how that panned out for you. 🤍",mentalhealth

Recently some very upsetting news was given to my partner and I and it has been checking the boxes of all my triggers. There is a possibility he may have to move back to the city we used to live in. While I would have to stay behind. The factors that cause this to be triggering for me is that


A. He struggles heavily with alcoholism as well as Bpd and all of our contacts and friends from said city are in the bar industry 
B. My own Bpd is causing my abandonment to flair up 
C. Early in our relationship he never cheated but was very secretive about his whereabouts as well as caused me a lot of trauma because of the way he acted while intoxicated 
D. Our financial situation is just now about to be back to normal but because of this news it would possibly put us back into debt/ almost homelessness 
E. I just recently worked extremely hard to create the home and life I have and this move could potentially cause me to have to start over completely the thought of having to dwindle my belongings down to a car trunk after just finally earning back a townhouse full of belongings through hard work is nauseating me 

I am completely consumed by the news and all of the possible scenarios that could play out. And whenever I try to talk about it for reassurance my partner is very cold and basically tells me it doesn’t effect me as much as him so I have no reason to be upset. I have tried to be calm and explain my anxieties but basically he doesn’t want to hear it and I do understand why because this is an extremely stressful and potentially life changing situation for him in different ways than it is for me.

I am just in my third month and after adjusting and having a really bad time, I just got the chance at home (450 Km from my workplace, I moved there for this year) to prepare for my dream job after I finish this year. 
I really badly want to study art and my mom found a course that is by your side to help you get into university. That’s a really big chance for me. I’d love to do it. But it’s in February. And then I’d have to leave early. 6 months early. 
And I’m not good at confrontation, so it’s a horror for me to talk to the person responsible for me. I asked a guy, who is supposed to help people who do this kind of year. He promised to answer me, but he hasn’t since Wednesday. I really want to know, what would change if I shorten the year. 
And after all this, my anxiety is through the roof. I really want it clear but I fear the conversation with the ‘manager’ at my place. She is really nice and all but I don’t know how to deal with this.",mentalhealth
1697332849.0,Friend suddenly disconnects socially and looks lost,"3rd time this has happened recently.

My friend after a few drinks absolutely shuts off socially. One worded responses to everything, cant give direct yes or no answers. Just a bunch of ""i dont knows"" when i give him space and observe him hes constantly scanning the room like he's focussing on tiny sounds all over the place. He tries to look to get away all the time. He didnt recognize that he was in my house at one point and asked for where the nearest exit is. His personality completely like someone else has just taken over his body. When hes not like this hes super talky.

Is there something going on with him or do people actually get like this when they drink?",mentalhealth

1697331147.0,Prescribed depression medication without being told it was for depression,"This is a bit of a long post, to me anyways, and I don’t really know where to start. I did really well academically in high school and it was entirely self-driven. My mom never checked my grades, I decided if I went to school on any given day, there was no punishment for poor performance, or reward for good performance. I just had this almost magical ability to sit down and study for hours and then retain that information.

Since coming to college, I have lost that ability. I really struggle to pay attention in class, do homework, and study. It feels like I’m forcing myself to just stare at a page.

I went to a psychiatrist, got diagnosed with ADHD, and walked out with a Bupropion prescription. She said it was basically Adderall. I asked what the side effects were and she told me it caused headaches when stopping or starting the medication, but that was it.

I took it for a few weeks and it did nothing. She increased the dose and I still wasn’t any different, but had started losing weight (which is very bad in my case as I’m 5’10 120lbs).

A friend of mine was also recently diagnosed with ADHD and we compared prescriptions. She was surprised that I was on Bupropion because her brother takes it for depression. Apparently, while it can be used for ADHD, it is primarily for treating depression and weaning people off of cigarettes. It can cause a whole host of things including weight loss and depression, ironically.

Online it says not to give it out to people with eating disorders, and I told her that I had what basically was an eating disorder. Long story short, I stopped being hungry December of last year. I ran a very stupid experiment to see how long I could go before feeling hungry, but decided to stop at four days. Since then I’ve struggled to remember to eat because it’s hard to force yourself to eat when you’re not hungry.

You could argue that I don’t have what is psychologically considered an eating disorder and that’s why she felt comfortable prescribing it, and I’ll accept that, but she could have warned me. It feels like I was given this medication under false pretenses, and we never talked in-depth about depression. She asked if I had felt depressed and what my social life was like and that was it.

I’m not going to take the pills anymore and I’ve been looking into other doctors at different clinics because I feel like I just can’t trust her after this. Sadly, there’s a four month waiting list everywhere else so I’m just going to have to power through this semester and make up for it later.

I don’t know if this is common practice and maybe I’m getting upset for no reason, but I don’t like the dishonesty.",mentalhealth
1697331033.0,"My brain keeps telling me I have various mental disorders, what do I do?","I read the DSM-V at the ripe age of 15 years old. I only read the criteria as I couldn’t afford the whole DSM-V. The combination of having some knowledge about psychopathology and having self awareness has been a recipe for disaster. 

I’ve known that something is wrong with my brain my whole life. I tend to experience emotions intensely or not at all and rapidly shift between two. I’ve always thought it was depression. But I tend to notice other symptoms and link them to other disorders while I’m having a depressive episode. The first time, it was with ADHD. Some of my depressive symptoms overlapped with symptoms of ADHD and my brain made a connection. The second time, it was with ASD. I had a physical illness at the time and it caused me to have issues with social interaction and sensory processing. I linked those symptoms to ASD. I did see a professional for this, but I think he died cause he never got back to me. Whenever this happens, my brain finds instances of me expressing those symptoms in childhood so it’s not just a now thing.

Now, my brain is convinced I have bipolar II. I recently experienced something that meets the criteria of a hypo manic episode. My brain is now linking all my experiences to that. 

It’s really annoying. I feel embarrassed to go to a professional about these issues because my stupid brain keeps linking whatever the hell I have to mental disorders I probably don’t have. I think it is important to mention that this isn’t factitious disorder. I’m not trying to deceive people, nor do I present myself as ill, my brain just keeps making connections.

1697330086.0,is therapy making me worse or are things finally catching up to me? is suppression my best option? explanation continued in comment,"Page 1/2

I’ll try to summarize but there’s a lot to unload. I’m a 29 year old woman and have what I’d call a hard life though I haven’t thought so until recently. I’ve had multiple near death encounters though I won’t get into that, grew up with parents who were unfit, and likely have a lot of childhood trauma. The thing is that up until now I have always felt genuinely unaffected by it all and able to rise above until my grandfather passed away who was like a father to me and my true hero. I have always saw so much of myself in him. He made me love what he loves, and instilled me to create a career as a botanist. I will never love another human like him.

A year ago he had a heart attack, and I left my home thousands of miles away to go be with family. I always considered my grandparents to be more of my parents than my real ones and thought that they were the only reason I believed in platonic and romantic love. After a month of a traumatic stay in the hospital, he died. I don’t remember feeling any sort of way because I was only focused on being there for my family, especially my grandmother who was with his for over 60 years since she was 15 years old. I have a history of dissociating so I would guess that is what I was dealing with.

Upon his passing, I found out she had grown to hate him the past three years while I was away. She found out about previous infidelities, and she lost all trust and respect for him. She was deeply hurt, and I guess he never gave her closure in telling her why he did it and grew to resent her for how she began to treat him. My family members are very selfish and narcissistic people, so they were expecting my grandmother to “just get over” my grandfathers passing within the first month and either cut off ties to her or would scream at her for being sad. 

That left me being the only one who would listen to her. I know she needed it, and we have a deep bond and understanding of each other, but in listening I found out so many details I might have been better off not knowing. I found out that their relationship was toxic not limited to infidelity and physical abuse. There was a point that he encouraged her to kill herself then made fun of her for “not even being able to do that right.” She begged him to compliment her, but all he could say was that she was a good mother and kept his house clean. She thinks he has children with other women, though I don’t know what to believe. In light of this information, I don’t know if I believe in love at all since my only example turned out to be a facade.

Months after his passing, she found out that their joint bank account of over $150K had been nearly entirely drained by him. She has lost his social security and now lives alone in their house. In her grieving, she damned him every chance she could get, and declared she hated him and had no reason to live. She also lost her filter and told me about how my parents raised me and my siblings. I have vague memories of my father sexually assaulting me and she confirmed them. My father still wants me to sleep in his bed when I’m at his home, calls me hot, walks in on my showering, and I caught him peeping and staring at me while I was getting dressed. My grandmother also told me that my mother would poison my brother and I to get attention from hospitals, which would explain circumstances of my mother giving me “special medicine,” finding poison in her bathroom cabinets, and having extreme illness as a kid. Apparently these events were confirmed by doctors, and after CPS was skeptical the visit to the hospital stopped. I would still become ill. My mother would insist that I go to the hospital while my father strongly opposed. So I mostly stayed at home alone with them fighting about it.

I wasn’t allowed by my parents to have negative emotions. If I did, they’d tell me that they would take me to the “kid pound” to be adopted by another family or euthanized. Any time I felt sick, my dad told me I was wanting attention, so I learned to not express my illness and ultimately not feel it. I still deal with these consequences today and mostly have muted negative emotions and extreme tolerance to pain with refusal to go to a doctor unless I think I might die or am forced to (i.e. being but by a venomous snake or being hit by a truck). Even then I go reluctantly. If my siblings and I argued, my dad would hand us knives and tell us to kill each other. Years ago, my mother admitted they purposefully underfed me because they didn’t want me turning into a fat girl. I was 37 pounds in 5th grade and am unable to gain weight or feel hunger to this day. 

When I was 16 I tried to kill myself and was forced to go to a psychiatric ward. It cost a lot of money, and my mom had a habit of racking up tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt, so I guess my stay made it financially difficult for them. My dad was ashamed to have a daughter like me because he is about public image and I was an embarrassment for being in a ward, so I never told anyone why I missed school and didn’t get visits from them in the hospital. I remember my nurse telling me I was a pretty girl and wondering if I realized I didn’t belong there because I didn’t open up about anything to my doctors to save my family’s face, so she assumed I was a normal girl with a normal childhood. That validated my fathers invalidation. After my stay, my parents’ relationship worsened. My dad started working at a pizzeria where I worked saying it was to make extra money for my stay.

1697343550.0,My bf will be raped tomorrow,"
First of all, sorry for my Broken english, its not my first language.
I dont know if this ks the right place to post this but i need help with this.

So, i 15m, have a long distance bf, 16m, we have been together for 4 months now, he is the sweetest boy i have ever met, but, he might kill himself after tomorrow.

So, to start this, his parents, were already very old when they had him. They had a son because of social pressure, and made sure to remind this to him every single day of his life, he had a rather normal chilhood until he was about 8 years old.

At that age, his cousin, who was 21 at that time, started raping him all summer. He put his head into a tub while he raped him as he cut his back with a broken bottle,  telling him how despicable he was and how much everyone hates him.

In school, he had almost no friends, once, his group of friends, made him get into an abandoned building and let him in during the entire day, he got bullied all his life, his mother didnt care for him, because even the teachers bullied him, and they told everyone, he was faking getting bullied for attention. It got to a point where even a teacher tried to throw him down the stairs.

One day, when he was 10, at the exit of school, 2 men started touching him, and he couldnt do anything to stop them, at 11, the school janitor, locked him and tried to rape him, but failed, because some kid entered.

As he grew, his bulling grew too and the agressivity of his cousin too.

At 13, he after 3 scde attemtps, finally managed to make his cousin stop. At that time, life became a bit better for him, he got friends, but then in 2021 everything went upside down

Firstly, his group of new friends, turned on him. They hit him, to the point where he almost bled out,  this happened almost everyday, his mother, didnt care for him and just negleted him. His entire town bullied and hurt him all the time, in this time, he tried to end himself 5 more times.

He got some virtual friends who he could talk to, and distract himself with, but, they both died.
One ended himself and the other one...

She was going to see her virtual friend irl, my bf warned her not to, but she didnt care.
She told him that his scars were disgusting and that he deserved all that his cousin did to him.
That same day, her friend stabbed her because of a disagreement.

Then, the bulling, started to be less extreme.
He still got and gets kicked or punched every time school ends, but they dont try to kill him or try to dismember him anymore.

In 2022-2023 he started going to see a therapist, and he got better, but because of that, he got 9 classes suspended.

Now in 2023, he is in advanced class, he hasnt slept for 2 weeks neither has he eaten nearly anything so he is weak. 
The problem is, there is a teacher, who eventually, got closer and closer to raping him.
First, he massaged his shoulders while explaining to him, then, he started rubbing his nipple, and last week, he touched his genitals. This wensday, the teacher, took his hand when the bell rang and made him stay after class. When there wasnt nobody left, he grabbed his hair and both of his hands, and threw him to the floor.
He tried to scream, but the teacher put his fingers in his mouth. He tried to bite him, escape, everything. 
But he was too weak to escape.
The teacher put his pants down and got closer, but suddenly, he heard people coming and let him go

On mondays, he usually has spanish before break, but because of some issues, he will have class with the teacher that tried to rape him just before break.

We are afraid, that the teacher might make him stay in during break and rape him.

We cant contact police, he already did, but they didnt believe him, they said he needed proof, and also, the officer sons, bullied him, so that isnt an option.

The principal hates him and also neglets him.

His parents dont believe or care about him.

So, what can he do to stop being raped and touched?

He cant miss class because he wants to get an honor degree so he can move out.

What can he do? 

He said if he gets raped again, he will not be able to deal with the trauma, so what can i do?

1697316142.0,I've been feeling depressed and disgusted this past week ... how can I get my shit together ASAP?,"I need to get my shit together ASAP because I'm in law school and need to focus.

This past week, it was our fall break. I didn't really get much done. I stayed home, cooked, spent a day with the family, and that's about it. 

The international events made me feel terrible. I was watching all the videos that would come up on my feed. I noticed it was affecting me and I deleted my social media apps off my phone this morning. 

On top of that, I lost 2 of my friends over these events. I posted a story acknowledging the horrible things happening in Gaza. While denouncing Hamas, of course. But two of my friends replied, accusing me of being a Hamas supporter while they both straight up said they do not care about the events because they hate Muslims (they actually admitted this ...). 

Anyway. I'm just feeling like shit now. I feel like I should've gotten more work done over break. I can't seem to focus when I do sit down to study. I feel guilty. I feel lazy. I feel upset. 

What's your guys' advice to getting back on track ASAP? I'm going to look for a therapist but that's going to take at least a couple weeks. Just short term so I can get back into the grind before I fall behind in school.

Thank you. ",mentalhealth

My dad was and still is an abusive alcoholic which I can't really remember anything of even though I should since my mother and brother tell me he used to do all kinds of traumatic things like hitting us with objects and screaming and hitting my mother I really only remember the good things of early childhood which people told me is a defense mechanism of my brain to protect me.

OCD really started effecting my life when I turned 13-14 ever since I had intrusive thoughts about a certain topic in my mind and head that never left me and stayed in my mind for the whole day and sometimes even in my sleep it's something I think about when I go to bed and when I wake up.

1697314113.0,How can I stop being so angry all the time and lashing out at my family?,"Hi everyone. Posting on here because I’ve had a rough past two weeks and I feel like my mental health has really deteriorated with no promise of getting better and I feel really down.

For some context, I’m a 22 year old living with my Mom and my Stepdad. They have a history of being verbally abusive with me and when I was about 15/15, slightly physically abusive. I’ve had to deal with this for many years, and it’s affected me a great deal. My Mom shouts and swears at me a lot, blames me for a lot of things and in general can be quite nasty. An example of this was two weeks ago when I was coming down with COVID, and I had told her I’d wash my dishes in the morning as my head was hurting a lot and I felt so ill. She proceeded to bang around the house, call me a ‘fucking prick’ and things like ‘lazy’ ‘useless’ etc. It was really scary to be honest and the first major episode from her in a while.

Fast forward to today and I just have a lot of repressed anger about this and previous incidents. She refused to apologise for swearing at me and told my family members that I was the one who brought it onto myself. This always happens and I just feel like I am sick of this cycle, but I have no way of getting out.

I absolutely want to try and get out of it, but there’s times where she does try to apologise in her own way (kind of bury it under the rug and act nice before it happens again). I’m used to it but recently I’ve become really conscious about my own anger. I just get so frustrated and cut her off even if she does try with me lately and I’m worried I’m just going to mess things up even more. I guess what I’m trying to say is I don’t know how to deal with my anger towards my family and I’m scared I’m turning into a really unpleasant and horrible person. I really do want to try with her, but I just feel so damn angry all of the time

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can cope with this and avoid lashing out?

My wife is all about living a healthy lifestyle, being well ordered, disciplined, etc. As she should be and I can get behind that completely. I want those things for myself. But I always feel like there’s something inhibiting me from moving forward. For starters, I tend to be a very closed off person. And that’s in regard in regard to anyone I have relationship with whether it’s my wife or friends. It’s not just that I choose not to share certain details, but often times I just feel as though I can’t. When I do try to, it’s not without a great mental effort on my part, and it usually takes me several minutes sitting in silence before I can get the words out, even if I know what I want to say.

My wife has caught me numerous time’s in something that I’ve meant to keep private. It’s not necessarily anything nefarious. It’s not always something she’s displeased with, but it doesn’t stop me from feeling shame and embarrassment. And it doesn’t stop her from being hurt because she feels that I can’t trust her.

1697312365.0,Being prescribed medication before receiving a proper diagnosis?,"Before 2013; I didn't know how long it would take to diagnose someone with a mental disorder worth prescribing psychotropic medication over. I didn't know that most sessions with psychiatrists would be something like 5 to 20 minutes long on average and that they will prescribe medication to you after only one session.

I was first prescribed Klonopin and Lexapro by a psychiatrist to treat anxiety and depression back in 2013. It was only after one session and it lasted just a few minutes. Since 2013; I've met with four different psychiatrists from various different practices and they all behave pretty much the same way. Within my first sessions with them; I'd get them sighing at me, rolling their eyes at me, yawning at me, rushing me along, etc. With the last two psychiatrists I had; they simply asked me what my previous psychiatrists were prescribing to me and just continued to prescribe to me more of the same.

I first went to see a psychologist with a PhD. in order to have myself evaluated for any and all mental disorders, personality disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, etc. back in 2016. He diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. This diagnosis appears in my psychological evaluation report that he gave me. Before that point--such a diagnosis did not appear in any of my medical records with the other mental health care providers I had already seen.

I was first prescribed an antipsychotic (Abilify) in 2017 and was taking it throughout late-2017, all of 2018, and early-2019. It was supposedly meant to treat anxiety and depression. My most recent psychiatrist decided to stop prescribing it to me.

I developed hallucinations for the first time in October of 2019. I was involuntarily committed to a hospital in August of 2022.

Is it common to be prescribed psychotropic medication meant to treat disorders before receiving an actual diagnosis?",mentalhealth
1697311910.0,Is youth really over at 25 in a physical way?,"I worry that now that I'm 26 I'm losing what some people would call ""explosive energy"", in the way like you are faster and stronger in a physical way when you're younger. I am also afraid that I will soon regret that I didn't make more of myself as a person and the time to really explore myself as for what my potential is, especially physically is already over soon. I know I could just go out and do it and I don't want to continue with a ""but"" now, so I won't. I will just say that the Realisation of me having a certain potential and feeling very good and self confident about it, is coming in very rare phases and is not always there. I just went outside walking and listened to music and felt so confident and I know this sounds unhealthy socially, but I think it's also because it's the feeling of agression I get, when I feel that I have been told a lot as a kid, that I can't do certain things or that I'm not able or my parent even implied that I was ill psychologically, which is of course a very bad and also completely wrong message to send. And sometimes when I feel like all of that is in the background of my mind and I, at the same time have evidence that they are wrong and it's true that someone is or was mistreading me and i don't give a shit about them in that way anymore, I feel so energized. And really able physically if you know the feeling I mean. Just like you could do anything and you don't care about anyone and that is very POSITIVE. Also thst you could beat anyone. I just wished I could make that my main feeling in life instead of feeling very depressed and unlovable for most of the time. Yes, I obviously go to therapy, so please don't tell me to go, I didn't go because of what I wrote btw. I just wonder about if it's really true that you kind of are really, physically, in your prime until 25 or 30 I guess and if my time is already ""over"" in a way, if someone maybe has an advice on this.

It will all be resolved and he’s definitely going to come back. But for the time being we’re doing long distance until he comes back. I’m not really happy with this whole long distance thing.

It’s like she wants to go out to dinner to celebrate and unfortunately I got stuck having to go out to dinner with one of her friends.

Since then pain in the central part of the forehead. Paracetamol and other painkillers don't work. Have to keep clenching jaw, opening and closing it to try and break down the pressure in the central part of the forehead (pain is nowhere else). 

Behaviours are... thought there was a deeper meaning to numbers on license plates. Thought they could heal people at one point. Constant thoughts of being a bad person, and making mistakes. Thinks they are going to prison. Paranoid that people are against them.

Back and forth between mental health teams, A&E due to being crippled by anxiety, feeling depressed and just want to lay in bed watching TV to distract their brain. Pain is 24/7 in their forehead while awake and constantly picking at it with their fingers and gyrating their jaw.

1697324698.0,Man boobs ruining my life,"So I've been a chubby kid ever since I can remember and have had a big/loose chest. That's just how my body stores fat. I remember in kindergarten, a boy mockingly asked me why I had such a big chest during swimming lessons and pinched them. It was the first time I felt that my chest was something abnormal. Somehow, this lsmall interaction stuck with me, and I never went for swimming lessons again and still can't swim at all. I know it's kind of silly, but Im surprised too at how much a kid of that age can get embarrassed about their body.

Nevertheless, this stuck with me. As I grew older, my chest grew bigger, and I became less confident, especially when puberty hit. I got bad at things I used to be good at, like debate and football because I was so self-conscious about my body that I couldn't concentrate at all. Eventually, I stopped doing all my favorite activities like debate and football, and my school life and grades were severely affected.

Now, fast forward to today, I'm in college, and my man boobs are still literally affecting my future. I have zero confidence because it feels like everyone is judging my big moobs. Even though most of it might be in my head, things are getting worse and worse. My friends make fun of my moobs (not bullying). I slouch forward to make my moobs less prominent, but this has destroyed my posture and caused back pain. I don't go to college and club events, parties and I haven't even explored my school campus in the 3 years I've been here because I'm too self conscious.

I tried to get over this by going to the gym. But I'm too afraid of wearing a tee because my moobs are so prominent in them. I can't wear a hoodie because I live in a warm climate. I can't go to the dining halls because I feel so self-conscious, and I end up ordering food for 2-3 meals a day (my school conveniently has excellent food delivery services). All the bridges that could help me get better seem to be burning because of my self-consciousness.

And need I mention, I can't talk to girls. It's not that I'm afraid of them or something, but I feel too self-conscious in front of them. I don't know why I have this image of a perfect me and can't seem to do anything because I'm not it. I've met so many good girls, but I chicken out before anything starts.

I've yet to see a doctor about my moobs, but I'm pretty sure it's all fat, given I had them pre-puberty as well. I'm soon graduating from college, and I know that if I continue to miss opportunities because I don't feel confident enough, I will lose big time in life. Has anyone here gone through this? Can you guys give any advice?

I(24 F) have always thought that if I don’t like something I can change it. It’s what always kept me going. I can change my appearance, and who I am. I can change the people I surround myself with, and the place I work. But I always end up in the same place. Unhappy. It’s no one’s fault that I feel this way. If you change your environment constantly, and it still persists maybe it’s you right? I’m just tired of changing, or thinking I’ve changed to only come back to my bad habits. For years I struggled with an Ed and I thought I had recovered. I got help and I even gained weight, maybe a bit too much weight. I was happy for about 4 years even at my heaviest. But for the last year something changed. I moved back in with my family, and fiancé, and I’ve been completely focused one losing weight. Everyone keeps congratulating me on my weight loss, and telling me how good I’m doing. On top of that I’ve been going back to school, working a part time job, and helping take care of my 88 year old grandmother. These are the only things keeping me going right now. I’m so unhappy. I feel guilty because my family is so happy to have me here, and they think I’m healthy. Nobody knows how sick I am again. I don’t want to unalive myself. I could never do that to the people that love me. But I am no longer taking care of myself. All my energy goes into looking good, and losing weight. I honestly hope my illness takes me one day. Everyday I wake up I feel excited at the thought that I’m one day closer. I’m selfish and I’m unhappy. I give up. If my family and fiancé knew they’d be so disappointed, but I just can’t keep putting effort into changing when nothing ever changed. Nothings new and it’s driving me crazy.

I think it’s because so much has happened in the past week or two.

Everything is wrong and I want to go home but I am home. 

In the past two weeks- mostly the last week:

One of my cats could have a heart issue and the other is aggressive because he smells like the vet and she doesn’t recognize him. So he’s potentially got a heart issue and is isolated in the bathroom so his sister doesn’t hurt him. 

My cat has an ultrasound Wednesday for his possible heart issue. Wether they’re friends again or not, other cat is going too so she can also smell like the vet.

Parents both have covid, their cat suddenly died from the same issue mine could have AT THE SAME TIME WE WERE AT THE VET (different province), sister has kind of worrying health issues and may be evicted because her building sold. Parents’ dog may have cancer. 

My period is making my baseline anxiety and depression worse anyway. And I’m already medicated. I’ve had stress/IBS for the last 24 hours or more and no appetite either.

I want to figure out some more handable coping mechanism for some stuff that bothers me since a few years. Yes I know... Talking and Therapie all helps but I'm not asking for this kind of advice. In my circumstance I just try to get through it till I can allow myself to really cope with that whole shit. Right now my coping mechanism is keeping myself busy to a level were I am ill every 3-4weeks because my body can't handle the stress I'm exposing it to. I always crave for days without any obligations but when I got nothing to do I start to spiral down and getting small panic attacks - I can deal with them but obviously it's bothering me and they are putting me back every time.

So I basically ask for better ways to not cope with stuff... I know it's not healthy but I'm sure a few of u can understand what I mean. Maybe we can just exchange some tips and tricks to get trough - would be rly nice <3

PS. I Don't have a drastic kinda traumatising horror story like Trauma - I'm just a person that suppress emotional feelings and it helps me to keep going and to support the people around me when every thing else breaks down.

Right now I am having a terrible mental breakdown, you see,  I am not a wealthy person, I can hardly move outside of my city without hurting me a lot. You all won't believe the happiness  I've got when I heard that a solar eclipse was about to hover above my city, in it's most beautiful glory.

 then I went to buy protection but didn't find any, the entire city got them. I knew the risks of looking at it, so I avoided my very best to look at it, I only proceeded to see it, when an amazing couple I've met in the park gave me a filter. Everything was wonderful until I got home, and at the moment I am writing this post.

So, here comes what is killing me.

I admit, that although I knew the risks, before I had found any protection I couldn't resist trying to take a few quick glances at it, but everytime I did that, the sun was still there and my behavior was to immediately turn my head away from it. This happened a couple times, with me always looking away in less than a heartbeat.

1697322649.0,Possible Traumatic Event?,"I (20F) think I may have a form of possible PTSD or cPTSD from something I experienced in my childhood/early adolescence. 

From when I was about 11 years old to 16 years old, I was involved in the world of professional ballet. (This isn't the typical dance-class-after-school type of ballet- I mean the intense, 'Black Swan'-esque, psychological nightmare, training 40+ hours weekly, Russian coaches screaming at you and hitting you with a yardstick type- think the Red Room from the Black Widow movie). I was involved in this highly strict and professionalized world for about 5 years and it completely wrecked my life for that entire period of time. I didn't have a social life or friends because all of my spare time was spent in training- usually from about 3pm after school to 10-11pm at night. It was constant belittlement- you were insulted by coaches and your self-esteem was broken apart until the coaches were your only sense of validation. Injuries were rampant. The worst aspect was not feeling in control of my own life. I didn't control my life- the coaches did. I had no autonomy or decisionmaking power of my own and I felt trapped for years. 

Anyway, I quit when I was sixteen and was finally able to muster up the strength to just admit that I couldn't do it anymore. I was severely depressed and didn't see a future to my life since my life felt like something that wasn't mine. Soon after quitting I developed what seemed to be some sort of panic disorder- I would have these random, seemingly unprovoked awful anxiety attacks where I would just start throwing up and crying. I'd be getting sick to my stomach for hours, the room would be spinning, I'd be shaking and I'd lose all ability to have coherent thoughts. I'd almost feel trapped in my own body. The attacks were unprovoked- they weren't typical anxiety where they would happen when I was nervous or before important events, but literally were random. Since then I've gotten a handle on it- I'm in university now, I'm a straight-A prelaw student and I graduated with high honors and a 4.0 from high school. I still have the anxiety problem, though the physical symptoms are much rarer and more controllable now. I saw a therapist years ago and was diagnosed with severe general anxiety disorder- but i NEVER had any pattern of mental health issues before the years of ballet training. I never had even been the type to get anxious, and i'd never had a panic attack in my life. I occasionally have these episodes where I have this paralyzing fear of losing control over my own life and I feel like someone else is going to seize power over my life again. It's just this basic fear of losing decisionmaking power. I dissociate sometimes when the anxiety gets that bad. I also have very little memory of the 5 years of my life I lost to training. I don't remember any specific incidents from that time period; it's all a blur between ages 11 and 16. I have a very good memory otherwise for other parts of my life, so I'm not sure if that's some sort of way of my mind blocking it out. I have developed pretty bad rage issues also since that time (which I never had before)- I'll get abnormally enraged over these tiny little incidents like someone chewing too loudly or a bus driving too slow on my way to class. Once again, I had absolutely ZERO mental health issues prior to those years. I really don't want to self-diagnose here but I feel like some sort of trauma could be a possibility. I'd like to know so I can go about getting help for it. While the physical symptoms are almost nonexistent at this point, the mental symptoms are still there, and I still live with this odd constant fear of losing control over my life. Any thoughts?

She has depressive episodes semi frequently where she doesn’t care about anything, but whenever I try to talk to her about her mental health she brushes me off, saying that talking to someone won’t do her any good and that she just needs to “get a grip”. 
She’s clearly in a bad place, feeling lonely and lacking purpose but I don’t know what I can do to help, another problem is how upset it makes me which makes her feel even worse, I try my best to hide it but it still shows.

He put out a compliment, and I felt like the time called for a compliment. He then complimented me back. To which I complimented him. He noticed we were just cycling through compliments, and my first thought was how whenever I receive a compliment I feel like common courtesy dictates I compliment them back. I’ll keep complimenting them because they complimented me. I never remember to compliment people unless they compliment me. Which leads me to spiral thinking that I’m not a good person because I don’t start off with the compliments.

Another example, is my friend will say “love you” at the end of a call (we’re good friends) and then I’ll realize I should’ve been the one to say it first.

I don’t usually compliment someone unless they compliment me. I just don’t think about it, and then I feel bad because I should’ve remembered.

Plus it’s the same air asking questions. I am not usually curious, I’ll ask questions because I know that it’s the social norm to do so, and it makes people feel better when I ask questions.

1697320481.0,"depressed, can anybody tell me if it'll get better?","hey,  
  
so i have been struggling with OCD and anxiety disorders for years. For the most part, it all ends up revolving around the fact that I have an incredible fear of death. I can't cope with these fears anymore, they've been dominating life and for months and its reached a point where it sucked out all the enjoyment out of me. I feel bad most of the time, I'm irritable, I don't sleep well and a lot of the time i just randomly start crying because I can't take it anymore. According to all these tests, I'm suffering a major depressive episode, mostly because I've been thinking of suicide. I'm not actually considering it though, I'd never do. They always say thinking about it is already a bad sign but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to commit. It's ironic, of course, because I'm so incredibly afraid of death. I would never kill myself, but everything is just too much and I just want my peace, which is why i might have had the odd thought about it.

  
The funny thing is, even if I could get my OCD under control, I think I still wouldn't have any meaning in life. It always sounds so pretentious, especially because I used to make fun of people like that. Now I just can't see the point in living. Sooner or later you die anyway. I can't enjoy the moment at all if every day could be my last. I have never lived life to its fullest and I will most certainly regret a lot of things when its finally time. The thought of death becomes even worse in case I'd get mentally stable because then I'd have all the fun and enjoyment back and I'd never get enough of it. does that make sense?

does anybody here relate in some way? i know my problems / anxieties are irrational for the most part, which makes it all the more frustrating. i feel stupid and i can't cope with the fact i've let myself become such a wreck.",mentalhealth

1697306406.0,Did I have an anxiety attack?,"Hello :)

I've been going through a really tough time, and a few days ago during the night I got a really bad headache, and was shaking. Now, I've not had any appetite for weeks, so I blamed it on the lack of food/water, took some painkillers, drank water and forcefed myself. It didn't get better, only worse over the next 10 minutes. 

Suddenly, I started hyperventilating, almost crying, my hands and forearms went completely numb and were tingling as I sat there hyperventilating for 2-3 minutes, and I got really dizzy and lightheaded. 

I sat with my head down so I wouldn't pass out and tried to just breathe slower, and then went to get some fresh air.

I’m currently a university student. I have met this person since my first semester in university, and we have gradually become close friends. This person is one of the kindest and nicest people I know.

But then again she told me what traits she liked in a guy, some of which I have (maybe wishful delusional thinking).

""The Coddling of the American Mind"" proposes antifragility as a cure for safetyism, emphasizing that exposure to challenges and risks, rather than protection from them, strengthens individuals' resilience and mental toughness.

  
I'm new to Reddit and have noticed that a lot of words are censored. Understandably, they are hard to hear. Words such as ""abortion,"" ""suicide,"" or ""sex"" tend to be censored in some fashion, such as ""aortion,"" ""s\*\*cide,"" or ""sx.""

  
My question to Reddit is, is it a social miscalculation if I don't censor these words? Will these words truly cause someone physiological duress? If you yourself have this experience, I'm curious about how you feel when seeing these words in their direct form rather than the censored form.

1697300812.0,"I wanted to help my sister, going through depression","Hey, hello. I needed help in understanding my sister's situation right now. I'll give a brief context, hoping that helps.

I (27M) and my sister(24F) are very close. But I have to move to a different city for work. Recently my sister started having episodes of anxiety, body pain and panic attacks. And she consulted a therapist and the therapist said she is clinically depressed. So the TLDR is I wanted to help her, but not sure how to. I am going to state things that happened and things I did and needed community's help in giving me directions.

We are from India, if that matters. So quick brief context is,
- Our childhood was not great. Mom and dad had a lot of fights and disagreements, such that they were stayed separated for 4 years and now they are back. But dad was bit of an alcoholic at that point in time, causing whole lot of wreck in the family's peace. So bit of troubled childhood.
- 2 years back, I moved out of my family for work. So she and I spent a bit of less time over the time. And she too started going for work.
- This year one of her close friend went to UK and that is what I feel like the start of the intense sadness and etc.
- Also, in the mean time, she was hung up on buying a lot of expensive things, because her close friends could, but because of our financial situations my parents advised her not to, that led up to a lot of quarrel. From what I have seen, she is feeling bit of financially crippled because her close friends are bit well off. Not sure if this factored into what she is going through, but I feel like this contributed to a lot of quarrel in the house.
- And her workplace is a place of medical field, where is used to work with healthcare people, and the process. She did Masters in Social work and working with hospitals. So she knows more about mental health than I am. She reads about those things and work with these patients as well. Plus her day to day work, she had to see few patients suffer and sometimes worse. I am also afraid whether this could have contributed to her disturbance. 
- But this change in her life, with financially well off friends, the recent work place, quarrel at home, feeling less achieved (she talks like that often), is the new things that happened in the recent times.

Now coming to the things we did,
- My parents are bit old fashioned, but I have gave them a whole talk to not force her to do anything, considering her mental health is not great. And they are so helping right now. She starves intentionally sometimes, and my mom tries to feed her, atleast some juice etc.
- Her boyfriend is also very supportive, taking her to beach, or some cafe etc. 
- My sister (another sister) and I are also helpful. I moved back with her to keep an eye on her because she did self harm (cutti*g her wrists) multiple times. 
- I tried getting her some books, drawing books, things that she can do if she is so physically exhausted etc. But nothing works.
- I have planned to take her with me to my city, away from the home, and also asked her to take 2 weeks work-off, so to see if any of those are triggers and she can experiment a new place with new routine.
- She met a therapist, she felt not okay. then found another therapist. then we checked a psychiatrist and they gave some tablets, and now one of her senior folk at work suggested to get second opinion - so we might be visiting this new psychiatrist as well. IDK man. Is jumping one expert after one expert with just one session is good? idk, she feels not okay and I dont want to force.
Few more observations.
- She has her ups and downs. She is active most time, and dull and drained most times. And sneak upto her room when people are bit busy and cut herself.
- She says her head is paining a lot to an extent she wants to cut her. Not sure how to deal with this.
- But if it comes to meeting her friends, or something thats important to her, she makes up her mind somehow and does that. Like even though she was dull throughout the evening, she just gets up to meet them. I will be canceled for asking this, but can she put the same motivation to not cut herself?
- Also I feel like she knowing a lot of depression and the symptoms of depression (because of her work), she overthought to an extent, she started feeling this? Can this be possible? Again, I know I will be cancelled. but if that is case, I can ask her to consider different field with her MSW degree. (something other than healthcare)
- She listens to depressed songs, sad songs, reads only sad books. Is that normal? I mean, again as a rational approach, shouldnt we not go deep into the rabbit hole that tries to kill us?

I might have left some details. But I can help once we have some inputs coming in. Cause I am confused. I have made my family and people to act certain way to not trigger her or something, but not sure how long they will do this considering they might not have a greater understanding about what's happening. So I need to understand this as well.

I know we should deal with kindness and so, but is there a chance, that could be taken advantage to stay the same way, like not putting in necessary efforts? I know I read through so many posts, and people said they might not have the energy to even wake up from the bed, but then how to go towards healing?",mentalhealth

1697299835.0,is my mother abusive even though she loves me??,"\[edit i am safe and i am mostly content and this is not actively harming me i just need some unbiased insight\] im 17 and ive struggled with my relationship with my mother for a long time and i feel like im going crazy trying to figure it out

some context: my mother also struggles mentally and all throughout my childhood i have seen her in and out of physciatric wards, her most vunreable moments, and scary moments. i still dont know what shes diagnosed with but from what i can assume i think it might be BPD?? she has told me straight up she just has a bit of depression and anxiety but i know its more than that

shes fought with my dad for years and years and i need to know whether these fights are abusive or normal.

it usually starts with me hearing screaming, whether on the phone or in person (irl hasnt happened for a while) i will hear my mother scream and cry and accuse my dad of things like cheating, sneaking around and other outrageous things. she says pretty horrific things to him and i dont know the full story obviouslt and i dont rlly know what he says back, but from what hes told me, he doesnt know why this happens and she blows up for seemingly no reason. my dad has sat in my room crying to me not knowing what to do or what hes done wrong and all i know is that he would never do alot of those things (this doesnt mean hes perfect or anything he also says some pretty hurtful things to my mum but i know his character)

its so hard to summarize this but when she gets like this, she will kick him out throw his stuff away call him and his family dirty names and so on. thats just with him.... but with me?

me and my mother have explosive arguments aswell.

for example i get extremely mad and my anger gets so bad that i dont know how to control it and i will be very destructive. throw things, multiple holes in walls, hurt myself yell etc. these arguments dont really come from much, it could be as simple as me getting mad that she isnt listening to me (i usually get mad first) and then all of a sudden i go from 0 to 100 and punch my wall scream my lungs out and whatevers closest to me gets hit or hurt, even if i dont mean it (ive hurt my pets a few times) it feels like i dont have any control in these moments like im so hot and and being burned alive and my body just throws a punch or gets taken over by something and then immediately after i dont know why i did that and start crying because i dont feel like i even did that. i feel so guilty and ashamed of myself and then i just freeze

so anyway when i get mad she gets mad aswell and does very similar things to me. some things  happen: she has threatened to get me taken away multiple times, threatens to call the cops or ambulance, almost everytime she takes my entire door off and i dont get it back. my door handles broken from being smashed and my door has holes from her banging trying to get in. she takes all my devices and its just overall very scary and i get called very similar things to when she fights with my dad. its so scary and i feel so unsafe. it never gets physical tho.

the next day after this would happen, she would wake me up saying ""hi darling do u want breakfast i love you"" ,be laughing on the phone to friends, cleaning the house doing normal things and i cant help but be so confused. how can u do that to me and act normal after.

after this happens i always hate her so much to the point i cant handle it, but i also have a side of me that misses her. i dont want to be mad at her, i know she loves me more than anything in the world and does everything for me, i feel bad for her because i know that shes not perfect and that shes very similar to me. i know the way she was treated by her parents and i want to forgive her but i cant because of what she has put me through. she always says how much she misses me, and seeing her face sadden when i dont reciprocate affection is terrible, and hearing her cry behind closed doors. i just want to get rid of the wall ive built and just want to give her a hug but i cant let myself open up my heart to her because i dont know how long untill theres another scary moment, and shes treating me like im trash.",mentalhealth

I've been dealing with symptoms of ADHD my entire life. Most my life, It has either been downsized or straight up ignored. I've only ever been punished for having ADHD behavior, most of which I can't control. I've dealt with threats of suicide from my own grandmother because I brought home a bad grade... I was in 3rd grade... (9 yrs old)

Before we moved to another City because of mums new boyfriend I was much more mentally healthy anyone that knew me before the move would tell you I changed for the worse after it, and this guy Is the same guy I Will talk about in the next sentence

I had to deal with a boyfriend of my mum who'se actions she completely ignored, and to this day denies ever happened (Forced me to rip my tooth out And forced me to copy a page for 5 Hours from a book because my handwriting wasn't ""perfect"").

Those were the worst, but to this day I still deal with near daily arguments, belittling and insults being hurled at me just because I have ADHD And I TRY TO MANAGE MY EMOTIONS.

What's worse is that they try to cover this up by being sweet every other time, and playing the Victim. I'm just made out to be a mentally unstable psychopath, that doesnt appreciate his family. When all they do is insult me.
I'm stuck in this house... 

So yea... I now feel completely empty inside. I gave up on myself, I hate myself, I see my life as a cruel joke... I tried putting as much feeling as I could into a drawing... The result was what I describe as what I see myself as... A shattered humanoid with no facial features. Basically a depiction of a completely Broken man that can't see who he is anymore. Atleast that's how I see it...
I just see myself as an annoyance to my friends... Despite their compliments I never agree with them... All I ever do Is fuck stuff up.

1697313015.0,Not being able to connect is destroying me again.,"This is going to be a rant. I'm just venting because I have nothing else to turn to at this point. I have a good relationship with my dad. I'm a daddy's girl and we've always been super close and he's supported me throughout my life as no one else has.

My parents are still wrapping up a shitty divorce because my mother is a narcissist and abusive piece of crap. She did everything she could to keep me and my brother away from seeing my dad. I was basically used as a trophy and treated that I should shut up and be a spectacle than be heard. Sort like an accomplishment that I was stuck with her and not him.

My dad describes me as I was a shell of a human being. I'm five years my dad has one video of me laughing and none of me looking genuinely happy in photos. 

Two years ago I managed to get the guts to run and move in with my dad after over six years of that hell hole. I've been depressed since I was 8, and have a skin picking disorder that was a majority of my s/h throughout the years. 

Living with my dad is good, so much better than where I was, I've started to try and rebuild. But things are quickly starting to spiral again. I'm so frustrated because I feel so alone. I started to rebuild enough that I understand that I'm no longer needing to hide all the time so locking myself away feels like genuine loneliness and I don't know what to do. Hiding and shutting up is all I know to do.
I've been put back into school, and over the years I've been lucky enough to continue advancing through grades even though I've never gotten anything except a few lucky grades and I honestly don't know how I got through 8 and 9. 

But now I'm in a new grade and I'm juggling 7 classes for just this semester. So I'm really struggling to try and keep up even though we've barely started. I'm already getting behind in a couple classes because I feel so burnt out and done with life.

My dad works full time so I barely get to see him when he wakes me up and then leaves for work and I sleep in until much later since I don't feel I can actually get up when he wants me to. Plus I've struggled with insomnia for many years so going to bed early has been really hard. 

My dad comes home around five or six and by the end of the day he doesn't want to do anything but watch the news. And once he's done watching the news he gets on the phone and talks with his new girlfriend who lives a couple hours for us practically the rest of the night. On Tuesdays he's also busy, on Wednesdays he helps at a recovery group late into the evening (around 10) after work so he's barely home for an hour. And then Thursdays he has meetings for his recovery group. And Fridays I have a youth group to attend that I've started to go to less and less.

So I barely see him, I feel like I can't connect with him since I'm stuck at home, alone, on my own for hours. I have no interest in dating or anything, but whenever I bring anything like that up my dad teases me about boys and it really irritates me more than I think it should. But a whole lifetime of having all my feelings downplayed like that makes me feel like I'm back at square one.

I feel like I'm losing my dad to his girlfriend and I know that's probably a selfish thought. As I write this I'm alone in the house with nothing to do except watch TV and draw because he's travelled a couple hours to be with her. I don't have many friends except one I talk to on the internet who lives in a completely different country.

I'm completely losing interest in things I once loved. I'm so caught up and anxious about school, trying to battle seven classes and the teachers constantly telling me to pursue things when I don't have the time. Or feel I don't. Starting in an art class my art is starting to feel like a task more than something fun and I'm scrutinizing it so much more. It's not fun anymore. I don't have any time to play my guitar and learn. All my videogames I've played a hundred times and I don't have anything new. My family can't afford to get a new ps since my PS3 is dying out. I don't mean to sound selfish or like I want this, I genuinely just want something else that might make me feel happy. 

I feel so numb and like I have to compete for my dad again after just getting him back. 

He's been my lifeline and there's so much else I could spill onto the table. 

I felt pushed to make this post because one of my friends recently hung himself because of false pedophile accusations by some kids doing it as a joke and have zero remorse. I've tried to stay away from a bunch of social media platforms and haven't taken an interest in them because of shit like this that happens. I honestly don't know where to go from here. I want to die without offing myself, I just want to simply not exist. 
And with all the crap happening in the world it doesn't help. And therapy is pretty much the last option because of it's cost, and I have almost no way to get there because I'm still struggling to get a driver's license.

Worst of all I can't even cry. With all the shit in my life and how horrible I feel I haven't been able to shed more than a few tears. I feel like I could cry a river and feel some relief but I can't even have that..

I feel slightly better just dumping a bunch of this stuff. Apologies for it being so long, I tried to keep it as short as possible.

**A little about me:**

I'm 15, from Australia and I moved the the UK \~4 years ago. I have autism and ADHD (Only got diagnosed last year), I have always been on the chubby side(Due to no interest in sports and I like baking) but over the past few years I'm now overweight. 

I would say I am a very sheltered child, I have no brothers and sisters and my family is comfortable financially. I love my parents and they do everything they can and only want the best for me. I was a B grade student and had enough friends in Australia.

**The Problem/Story (I don't even know, I've never written anything like this before)**

Up until I was about 9, I was very happy and content(with a few bullying hiccups along the way). I got moved to a different school which was a highschool so there were older students, I also was the only one from my previous school who moved there so I had no friends, eventually I made some but there were some real assholes and I seriously thought about killing myself. I had also been exposed to porn and drugs by older students (I refused drugs but it was still in the environment.) Then when I was 10/11, My father got a job in the UK, I don't think it payed much more but my parents wanted to experience living in another country, I was openly against this and didn't want to move. We arrived in the UK right as covid hit, so a lot of things were closed. Eventually I joined a school and because Au and UK school years start at different times, I was joining in halfway through a curriculum I didn't know. I struggled to make any friends as people made fun of my accent and I didn't understand the street lingo or culture. I went to this school for about a year. Also during this time I got a gaming laptop for my birthday and I started a downwards spiral into severe gaming addiction. I replaced needing real friends with online friends and I sunk over 4000 hours into games in about 3 years. 

After I was struggling so much at this school, my parents pulled me out and enrolled me into an online school, I really struggled with ADHD symptoms which led to me being unable to do the work without being distracted by video games or youtube or twitch etc. My parents then took me out of this for a year so I could trial medication (Such a long time because waiting times were astronomical). Over this year I basically had no social interaction and rarely went outside, I had no friends to meet with as I had made none since we came here.And here we are now, this school year. To be fair, i've really tried hard at doing the schoolwork this year and I'm doing okay. But I'm quite literally terrified to go outside and to talk to people other than my parents. I feel like I haven't changed since I was 9, I have the same skillset, I don't think I'm any smarter or have gained anything from the past few years. I decided to quit games and now I'm so incredibly lonely as now I don't even have my online friends to talk to. I have been going to the gym for a while with my dad, lost a bit of weight but that is it. I don't even know who i am anymore, I don't know what I'm interested in, I don't know what I like doing, I.. just don't know. I used to love drawing and reading books when I was younger but I feel no attraction towards them now, I want friends but I don't know how to find any, I don't even know what to say in a conversation anymore. 

Sorry if that was hard to read, I'm lost at what to do.

1697312776.0,URGENT - Suffering from anxiety & panic attacks for weeks,"I'll try to be short and concise

About 2 weeks ago my girlfriend started getting major anxiety attacks, which is warranted because she was under stress from a number of factors: *(roommate moving out, big exams, health concerns from putting pressure on herself to go to lots of workout classes, and feeling on the urge of passing out after every workout class)*

She has had a 2 month anxiety episode similar to this years ago, but not at this level.

It's like she has spiraled down into a dark hole and can't get out. Some moments are better than others, but it's now very very hard for her to do anything. She is feeling constant sadness and strong anxiety, to the point of having panic attacks in public. She can't drive, she can't go to the grocery store, she can't even get in the car with me to pick her mom up from the airport. It's as if she is waiting on/expecting something bad to happen, at all times.

The only thing that helps (a little bit) is playing her video game and watching TV, which helps her to not focus on the anxiety, but if she's not doing either of those 2 things, she is back to feeling like shit. She has barely left her apartment and is in bed 95% of the day. Her mom and I have tried to help her get out of her room, but every she does she starts believing she'll have another panic attack, which leads to another panic attack. She's told me she can't stop thinking, it's a non-stop flow of thoughts that make her feel like shit. Most notably always thinking about ""when will this go away"" and ""will I be like this forever?"" which only makes it worse on her.

I don't know how to help her, but I'm being as supportive as I can be without trying to tell her ""do this"" and ""try that.""

We both live out of state where her primary care is, but we were able to get her some medication a few days ago for the anxiety, but it only helps a little bit. She has a phone call with a psychiatrist on Monday, but that's about it.

I don't know what to do, or how to help.

Any suggestions is appreciated.",mentalhealth
1697312127.0,I'm worried and need serious advice for my sister,"This will be a long one so if you either don't have the time or patience I won't hold it against you. For the others, please bear with me. I'm in dire need of advice. I don't know how to handle a situation like this but I fear that if I don't make an effort, things will get much worse.

I have an older sister who I love dearly. She has helped me numerous times in the past and I simply owe her a lot. She made it clear to me what I wanted to do most with my future in a part of my life where I was seriously lost mentally.

Today my sister had an overall bad mood and whenever that's the case, I just follow her orders, do what I can to help while being understanding as best I can so that she neither gets the impression, that I don't care nor think that she's a tyrant and I'm afraid of her (I used to be afraid of her when I was younger,  since she would scream at me for doing something stupid or selfish). Then as the day got closer to the evening she seemed seriously fed up and said that she has an anxiety attack. 

She wasn't hyperventilating, visibly shacking or screaming but was simply pissed. So I thought the best course of action would be to give her some space since she didn't want to talk about it. 

Obviously, something triggered her. There were several times in the past where she got extremely angry at us (me, second oldest sister and mother) about something due to our laziness/negligence (like not properly cleaning the kitchen or cooking too late since she hates to eat dinner past 8 pm.) 

Then later at the dinner table, as we were eating, she tears up. Our mother came home from work 15 min before and already asked what was wrong as soon as she saw her but she insisted that she didn't want to talk about it and pursuing the question would have angered her more (it has in the past when she was upset). Our mom is that type of person that would want to say anything rather than nothing just to fill in the silence so she pretended that nothing was wrong. 

Our household started fairly toxic with our father having serious trust issues with everyone around him and assertiveness/aggressiveness against any stranger. Things only got worse once he started collecting serious debt and then would physically abuse our mom. She divorced him and he had to go to jail for a year but that was for another reason on top that I can't get into. All of this happened pretty early in our life (I was roughly 5 to 8 and my oldest sis roughly 13 to 16 years old).

My sister always has been very controlling of my life. There've been cases where she seriously pissed me off, with me saying some messed up things to her, but I've always immediately after regretted it and apologized. The story above probably contributed to her need of control alongside her being the oldest. On top of that, when I was born our parents told her that she needs to be the one to look after me and apparently I was **her** responsibility. Maybe not the best thing to say to an 8 year old but I'm probably just overanalyzing. 

I can't say whether or not she's facing a form of depression but I'm seriously afraid, that she might have very negative thoughts. She once visited a therapist that our mom goes to and absolutely hated it due to them being too much of a ""and how does that make you feel?"" therapist (too passive).

I've tried to talk with her about things but I either don't know what to say or she just isn't convinced of what I'm trying to tell her. Our mom ain't a big help too, since she just patronizes her constantly.

Please give me some advice, it's just not fair for her.

But most of the acts my myself has experienced I’ve done myself, except sexual assault, I’m against it. I’m against hurting other people in general, but I don’t feel anything about it. 



Old family pictures, I see myself being different, smiling, no dead eyes, actually feeling something. I’ve had a life being driven by crime and a criminal network for years, I’m not involved anymore, contact with small parts of the network. I’m done, that’s probably why I feel bored all the time. 




I want to feel like I did before. I enjoy feeling scared, I want a heavy adrenaline rush, I want to feel paranoid, I want to feel happy more then now. But it’s all nothing, I don’t wanna die, but I don’t care if I do. I don’t feel happy doing stuff I liked before, I sometimes feel happy socially sometimes, but often I’m just extremely irritated by people socially, but some people I like to spend time with. That’s the only thing I feel happy from now, and it’s only one person. I don’t feel happy around my family anymore.  



I need help. Please tell me how, I want to be normal.",mentalhealth

1697307311.0,Feeling Low and Struggling,"Currently going through a hard time at the moment. I've been signed off work long term due to my mental health. Basically lockdown took a huge toll on my health anxiety and long story short I developed agoraphobia so can't make it to work and they won't let me work from home.

This has resulted in me going on 50% pay which was just the kick in the nuts I needed when I was already feeling low. Pretty convinced I've lost my job too as I've been off so long and I'm unable to fulfil my duties and don't know when i will. 

Between my health anxiety, depression, physical health problems and now financial problems I'm struggling a lot. 

I have basic counselling but she said I need something more specific for my condition so now awaiting a referral to another team. Trying medication again but its making things worse so far.

Also getting support for my finances but again apparently this takes time. I just feel lost at the moment and no idea how to support myself for the next week or 2 both financially and emotionally.

Sorry for the wall of text, got a lot on my mind.

1697293701.0,Feel spaced and out like crying,"Hey all, I've struggled with mental health most my life. Bad childhood upbringing (father domestic violence) but I was very close to Mother.

Father commitment suicide when I was 17 when I was big enough to tell him to leave me and Mother alone.

Got a job when I was 18 and things started to look a bit brighter. 

In 2021, my Mother got ill and I took time off work to care for her, a few months after her passing, I was admitted to hospital myself. They found out I have a serious heart condition and requires major surgery which I'm still waiting for.

The past few years have took a massive toll on my mental health. 

All I have now is stress about the upcoming operation and financial problems with rent etc due to not being unable to work.

I just feel like nothing will ever be OK for me. I understand people go through a lot worse but feeling like shit atm.

1697306593.0,All of these fucking mental health subs have the opposite fucking effect on me,"What is the point of venting on a sub, hoping for someone to notice and genuinely show support, when I have to fight others for it. All I wanna do is shout at people to help me. All I need is to just clickbait people and snatch a lifeboat away from others. It's fucking dehumanizing to come here and hope someone will just help me a tiny bit out of my worst fucking episodes, only to be ignored. I saw a month back someone begging for upvotes on r/SuicideWatch and receiving hundreds. Literally just telling people ""Hey, I feel a little sad, updoots to the left"". Fucking braindead, all of you. All of the people, who fall for this. Even in my darkest moment, all I am is a contestant in a sick game show marketplace, competing for the affection of the burgeoisie. Like real life, like school, like jobs, like everything. No place in my life is safe from having to compete with others and dance for others sick entertainment.

And I can't talk to people either without being met with the same cookie cutter responses. The truth is no one knows the specifics of my problems and can only recommend me the most bare bones stuff. ""Go to therapy."" Very fucking cool, I have social phobia and the waiting lists extend into one year from now. ""Oh, you're not that horrible."" I don't fucking care, all I care about is to finally fit into society and not fear other people. ""Oh, I know a site for your problems."" Chances are, I've seen em. It's like talking to AI bots and having to specify every part of your sentence to fit into the language recognition algorithms of the other person. And then I still look back and get a response and realize I should've said this or that instead. So I might as well have shut up, since I get nothing out of it. Even now, pick a flair to signal to people, whether you state pre-approved opinions or whether you're being silly goofy and just angey. That way you can signal to people, what their pre-approved opinions on the post are. You can't talk about that yourself. FUCK YOU IM NOT JUST ANGRY MAYBE MY ANGER IS BASED ON SOMETHING REAL

And I can't show my true face either. I wanna just go somewhere and shout how much I fucking hate people. How much I want people, who remind me of myself too much, dead. How I'm ready to pull the trigger every day now. I have all the chemicals I need and can end this shit now. I am fucking ready. I just want to show my true colours. But due to fucking Reddit rules, all I can do is shyly imply my hatred and my issues, so that people can shyly talk me down. When no, this isn't a small issue in my life. It's everything, IT IS EVERY SECOND OF MY LIFE NOW. ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS THIS. My last thread got fucking locked, because I was too much of a fucking moron. All people giving out opinions about mental health, when they'd kick someone in the chin for having a symptom that affects them. You support me only when it doesn't personally fucking affect you.

So go on, ignore this post too, play a charade like everyone else, try and talk about the same points as before. I'm ready. All these mental health subreddits gave me is a profound hatred for every aspect of humanity. If I was in the Oval Office right now, I'd drop the nukes on the whole world and wipe out all of humanity. There's nothing more to fucking save. Human unintelligence was a mistake and I wish someone was smart enough to end the worst experiment in history. BURN ALL OF IT",mentalhealth

1697292818.0,Is it “normal” not to be interested in forming new relationships?,"I’m not really interested in actively meeting new people or becoming more than acquaintances with people. I am pretty sure I’m also aromantic, so I feel no desire to have a romantic relationship. It’s not that I don’t care about people- I care about my family and my lifelong best friends, and I consider myself a pretty empathetic person. However, I don’t care to form or keep new relationships. I’ve had many friends that have come and gone throughout my teen years (I’m 22 now) and I realize now that my parents don’t try and encourage me to make friends/hang out with people, I don’t really miss them. I feel bad for saying that; they were all nice people, don’t get me wrong! There’s no way to say it without sounding mean, but I guess I don’t care about my old friends enough to try and maintain or rekindle relationships with them. I have 2 friends I consider close, aside from family. I’m also pretty close with my brother, in that I tell him things about my life I wouldn’t tell my parents or other siblings. I enjoy hanging out with these 3, and I care about them and their happiness. One has been my best friend for the majority of my life and I feel very blessed to have her. I guess I don’t feel like I need any other close relationships. I’m not interested in dating at all, and sometimes I think I’d like to have sex but ultimately I mostly feel indifferent about it and I think I’d be fine just fantasizing instead.

I don’t feel lonely or like I need to form new relationships, so this is not “abnormal” in the sense of causing distress or wanting to fix it. I am just wondering, is this very unusual? It seems like everyone else is really invested in romance, in making new friends, puts in a lot of effort to keep up with old friends etc but I don’t really care.

1697292107.0,I need advice how to get better,"I actually don’t know how to start. I have mental problems for 3 years now which started with panic attacks, I was thinking I’m going to die, wanted to escape somewhere even I didn’t know where, my head, hands and legs were going extremely numb I was sure I was having a stroke or heart attack.

Those things suddenly stopped until one night a thought occurred while I was sleeping with my girlfriend and it went like “what if you stab and kill her while she sleeps” I was extremely panicked, I thought I’m crazy, I’m a bad person, and so on. I felt like I’m going to do that, I was really drowning… and those thoughts just switched from my girlfriend to my mother, to my friends… it was horrible.

I went to neurologist and he prescribed me SSRIs, two types, I had to take 1/4 3 times a day from one of them and one whole pill from the other, I was taking them for I think 9 months, then I stopped, then things got worse again I started them second time for a short period.

Now I’m off meds for year and a half, and I’m feeling worse again. Please tell me what to do I don’t want to live that way anymore, I’m desperate. I have intrusive thoughts that I’ll punch my girl, or when she’s not around that I’ll punch myself. It even got to the point where my head gets numb every time I come back from work and kiss her for hello. I can’t sleep well, and when I don’t have these harm thoughts I have others that I’m going crazy because I feel detached from reality sometimes, confused and not clearly thinking.

I’m afraid of being alone but at the same time I’m afraid that I’ll hurt people next to me. I read so many things maybe I have OCD, maybe anxiety, maybe both, I don’t know I just want it to stop and I want to lead a normal life. Please if someone goes trough the same thing, give me advice.

I'm a 17yo girl who's seeking for help. I live with my parents. My dad is too strict and protective with me and mom is abusive. She's always lying and insulting me for no apparent reason. She actually says she has a reason but they are lies, those things never happened and were never said. She threatens me. She says that I'm killing her and I'm gonna cry over her death. She says she's the one who's being abused and also that she's the only good person in the house. But she makes me feel invalid for my pain and my emotions.  According to her I'm always happy and I WANT to make her feel bad just bc I'm bored. How am I supposed to want that when I'm the one who cries while she screams pretending not to be screaming? She always reminds me that the pain I caused her is bigger than the one she felt when her mother, her niece and her sister died. (she refers to when I had a boyfriend who was trans) I really don't know what to do. I'm desperated now. I don't know where to live if I leave this place.

1697287838.0,I don't understand the pint,"I'll start with saying this is not a pity party nor am I trying to garner validation.
I grew up in a very abusive household dad left very early on, I was left with with a violent uncle and a spiteful drunk of a mother who favouritised my sister (my sister actually confirmed this, she is disgusted about it and has called mother out about it)
My school life was me being cruelly bullied, not much physical but always verbal and psychological, and at best I was just left out.
I didn't even get to leave the nightmare of my mother's house until I was in my early 20s.

I have no friends because for some reason they always leave me, I am always there for people but not a pushover, I can't keep friends and I started to wonder if it was me? Or was I doing something that I didn't know was wrong? I literally can't think of anything.

I have a longtime gf but I don't dare tell her about anything I'm going through most of the time because I can't explain it to her and I know she has a mountain of her own issues which she is going through.

It's not that she doesn't care, she just can't dedicate her time and mental energy to it because she has a lot of her own problems.

I have thought about ending it so many times, but truth is, what is the point?
If the afterlife exists then I am not going anywhere nice and if it doesn't and we just stop existing then I'll get there soon enough anyway, I can list all the places right on the spot of where I chose that if I did that's where I would.

I struggle to be happy in the moment because I know I'm not in the grander scheme.

I am not good at anything, and I know that I am not, please don't tell me I am at something I am really not.

I am quite unintelligent, slow to learn and I can't learn things as quick as most.

I have no qualities that make anything doable without a huge struggle, I suppose really I am just so tired of life and and everything that it involves.

I wish I could just stop existing completely, I have no purpose in this world, I am just here with no purpose.

I just needed to put this somewhere, I have no other outlet to do this.

1697301126.0,I'm tired. I want help but I don't know where to look for it,"This turned pretty long, I'm sorry if it's inappropriate in any way, I just wanted a place to let it all out and maybe get some advice if anyone ever felt this way.

I've been feeling very bad for years, I tried going to three different therapists at different points of my life. The last one told me I use a coping mechanism where I push something under the rug so I would avoid negative feelings, this is why it took me so long to realise something was wrong with me. Every time something happens I use maladaptive daydreaming to imagine a life where I have everything this one is lacking. It mostly being understanding friends that I feel good being around. I noticed in the last year that I started spending more and more of my time maladaptive daydreaming, because I feel like,  outside of my family whom I love very much,  there is nothing else for me here. But I am aware I am wasting away at my life and one day I will regret it. Yet I can't do anything to change my behavior, because everything seems boring. Taking a walk alone is boring and lonely and scary sometimes because people on the street look at me weird (because of my short hair i guess). 

I never feel comfortable, in my body (gender dysphoria), in my behavior. The fact that I'm a people pleaser has ruined me. Yet on a good day if you ask me how I am, I'll say great. It's only the bad days that hit me like a truck and it makes me realise how much shit I put up with, but then I go back to sweeping it under the rug and thinking I'm dramatic. I don't have the energy for my family, to call them and spend time with them. I'm always tired but I don't know what from. Everyone thinks I'm lazy, but I am just too worn out, not even feeling like doing the things I used to love, let alone doing chores or similar. My memory is bad, I forgot a lot of basic things that middle school students should know. I have OCD but I'm used to living with intrusive thoughts and obsessive habits and thoughts of ""if i don't put my perfume on 5 times someone will die"". But I guess that too can wear me out. I'm angry all the time, thinking of all the times people bullied me, harassed me, made me feel like I'm not worth being alive, and I just let it happen. I don't know what's wrong with me honestly. It's just a little bit of everything but it's obvious I did this to myself with my anxiety and overthinking. I don't know how to stop.

I come home from work and don't feel like doing anything until tomorrow when I work again, I only cry because I get 4 hours after work for myself, I keep thinking ""this can't be how I spend the rest of my life"". I want to quit work but my family lives easier since we got one more paycheck in the house. I am finally not a burden, I'm contributing. If I told them I want to take a few months off just to sit with myself and figure it out, my dad will have to take on all the burden, financially. I don't want to trouble him like that again. I just finished college and my sister started hers.

I only have energy to scroll on my phone. Yet I have these overwhelming thoughts that I'm wasting my life, and I want to do so many things. I want to spend time in the nature, and learn to play the guitar (I've been trying to start for 12 years?? It's insane that I still haven't when I want it so much). I want to do so many things but I don't have the energy for anything. I should probably continue with this therapist but she's so expensive and we've spent months without any improvement (in my opinion), all she told me is that I have OCD, which is so obvious honestly, but all the other things she didn't help with, it feels like she's stalling or something, I don't know I just want to feel okay. She did tell me I'm putting on a mask because i want to entertain people, i want them to feel good in my presence, but then after when i stop doing it and want to show them my real personality, they don't like me anymore, so i go back to it. She called me a Jester. I think of dying sometimes, i dont want to die, i really dont. But i feel like it will be the same in the end since im not really living. It's overwhelming,  like a cycle that keeps repeating and I want out, I get these panicked thoughts that I can't take it anymore and in those moments I have to do something but I don't know what, I don't think of really hurting myself but logically it's the only way to stop feeling like that every day. 

I'm wondering if getting a prescription for some pills that will motivate me (dopamine or serotonin i forgot and i dont have the energy to google, yes it's that bad lol), is better than trying to find my own way out. Two of my therapists suggested it (as a last resort after basically telling me they can't help and giving up on me). Cause I've been going down, for years and i don't know how to help myself when even showering is hard. I wonder if I'll be more proud of myself if i make it on my own, without pills. Or should I just take them and get this torture over with. I wonder if i'll get addicted to pills and if i try to stop taking them will i feel even worse.

Here is some background: I haven’t lived the best life growing up at all, going in and out of poverty and abusive family relationships and hardships, but now I never let that affect me. I choose not to blame any of my past to how i developed as a person now because I am a strong independent young woman. I don’t want to be known for my past or how I grew up. I have recently departed from my biological parents to give me some room to grow and learn about the world without being constricted as I was before. I recently had gotten welcomed into a house with a beautiful family and life is good. They have taken me to different places in the world and opened my eyes to the reality of life and kept it real with me. I work a full time job and am working towards my future. I love my family and I have no reason to be sad/angry. They are helping me build a plan to get me on my own two feet soon since my bio parents didn’t have the education to do so. Fast forward to now… I am still with the family but I haven’t been sober for more than ten minutes for the past three months. I don’t know how to stop or why I am pushing myself to do this. I am young and I really admire life but my mental health has been deteriorating and I have no idea why. I have a past of mental illnesses and medicine prescribed to me but I thought I fully healed and my therapist thought as well. I am just so confused and idk what to do.

My mum atleast for the first 6 years of my life constantly put me in the care of my grandma (Dad's mum) after the age of 6 it was limited to weekends because of school.
Throughout the years I've been remembering more And more shit from my past. Such as my grandma (mum's mum) literally threatening me with suicide anytime I came home with a bad grade... I was in third grade at the time. Next was my mum's horrible boyfriend which we moved in with. He forced me to rip my own tooth out, sat me down for 5 hours writing a stupid sentence from a book because my writing wasn't ""perfect"" And took me to some big Playground where I almost died. What did my mum do? I hear you ask? nothing. And years later she still denies any of it happening.
Lets skip ahead. To this day whenever there Is a disagreement I get threatened or insulted or belittled. Other times they Are sweet enough but then they pull stupid shit like this And I can never say no to anything. I can't even set proper boundaries because they completely ignore them or again insult And threaten me. Again there Is a mess somewhere And WHO gets blamed? Me.
I hate this fuckin house with all my heart I don't even Have a say in what can be in my room, and anytime someone visits or even just throughout the day they just BARGE IN MY ROOM WITHOUT KNOCKING OR ANYTHING AND THEN THEY INSULT ME FOR HAVING A PERCEIVED MESS DESPITE THE ROOM NOT EVEN BEING MESSY. 

There Is So much stupidity And bullshit but posts Have a character limit as far as I am Aware so feel free to ask in the comments And I might make a post about other much more idiotic shit in my life.
This Is a sort of vent post but seriously Tell me Is this abuse? Because if I brought this up to the people I am talking about in this post they'd just say ""Thats normal"" or ""That never happened you [random insult]""",mentalhealth

I ended up getting an offer for a little over 40k and took it because something is better than nothing. I have about 50k in student loans and had to take on a car payment to get to work reliably. Now I am in the office doing something kind of unrelated to my field 45-50 hours a week no OT, and after taxes, health insurance, and just student loan payments I end up with about 15 an hour which is absolutely horrible in this area and id make more working at a fucking Amazon warehouse 50 hours a week. If I moved out of my moms house with these rent prices I’d be left with basically no money. It’s hard to accept I will never own a home, never be able to support a family without struggling. I struggled throughout my teens and college and hoped it would be different once I graduated but no. I had a pretty rough childhood so my mental state was already shit and because of this I’m even worse I self harm like once a week and idk what to do I’ve never been this bad before. Sorry for the rant but I need help.

I’ve never sought help for mental health before but I think it’s long overdue. Idk how any of it works though like if I have depression does a doctor or a therapist diagnose me? If anyone has gone to get help I’d appreciate if you could tell what the process is like. I just can’t keep living like this everyday is just constant suicidal thoughts

For days now I’ll go 25+ hours without sleeping because I’m so anxious, then pass out for 6 and the cycle repeats.

 I feel I’m a danger to myself as I’ve relapsed heavily into self harm to cope with recent life events (homelessness while fleeing domestic violence, I was raped and SA’d multiple times this year, and the man who killed my father was let off in court with a fine because the police destroyed evidence after failing to investigate properly.)
 I don’t really have family or many friends and It’s gotten to a point where I’ll sit out on a bridge many nights begging to have the ability to jump. This turned into a vent as well, thank you for listening. Im just really scared and want to know what the process is. Thank you.",mentalhealth
1697281259.0,Parents died during the covid crises and now I am like a ghost,"M24. So my parents died two years ago during the covid crisis one after the another and I have been through a range of emotions since then. My home was taken over over by the landlord so I had two weeks to take my stuff from a home in which I had lived all my life and leave for my relatives in the same city. First 1 and a half month it was disbelief and absolute break down of my ability to work. So my relatives sent me to my uncle and aunt known for the strictness and discipline ""for correctional purposes"" within a week or two I was at odds with my aunt due to the unkind things she used to say about my parents that they should have been more strict with me they coddled me and I shouldn't voice my opinions and I should have figured by life out by now. This bred resentment and anger towards her deep rooted anger that is and went into a silent bubble for almost 9 months . I have always been a guy that followed my passion but nevertheless I took up a generic corporate job and saved up money to leave the place even though my aunt was not allowing me to leave and we had arguments about that too. Then I moved to another city away from all the relatives and it has been two years since everything has happened and I have switched jobs too which align with my passion too but now I feel completely hollow and empty. I am living with you could say a group of friends who I met in the new city but I see them happy with their families whenever they visit or they're significant others but me I feel I am unable to associate with anything or anyone completely hollow and see through sure I go to work I am also the weird comic relief in my office and friend groups (at least I believe so) but I can't seem to feel anything I want a bond or a connection but I run away as soon as someone tries that I emotionally rebuke them I sometimes turn towards alcoholism to forget my hollowness to feel something.

It's been 9 days since I received a call from my nephew (my best friends eldist) telling me that his Dad was dead.

Her place is only 10 minutes away from ours, so I rushed oved there and law enforcement had the place taped up as a crime scene and he was still in the back yard. Mom, my wife, myself and the police all sat there waiting in her living room waiting for the coroner while he was just a few feet behind me with only a brick wall. After the police left, my mother described in detail what she saw when she opened the door. Descriptive details of his body position. 

I have constant flashbacks and intrusive thoughts related to that morning. Im very triggered by certain words, and when people mention death casually, I start to get triggered. I'm an ICU nurse with over a decade of experience,, so I've dealth with trauma and intense sorrowful situations, but this is just absolutely crippling at times. I can't sleep well and often wake up not able to go back to sleep.

I’ve always struggled, i’ve had really bad anxiety for most of my teenage years. I’ve had bad days here and there that ultimately developed into bad weeks. But it always got better. I recieved therapy for emetophobia from march-august. I felt the best i ever had during early august.

However as august drew to a close, and exam results got nearer, i got worse and worse. I didn’t leave the house, i could barely get up. I blamed this on exam stress, but looking back i don’t think that was it.

Results day came around and i did good (all As and A*s). But i didn’t feel happy. I knew how to act happy and look happy but i just didn’t feel it. School started a week or so after that and it just got worse and worse. 

My confidence has gone down so much, and my anxiety surrounding emetophobia is slowly creeping back into my life. The only place i go is school, and even now im finding it difficult to get up in the morning and go. I love school, i love the subjects that im doing and i love the routine, but im just not enjoying anything. All the hobbies i previously had (music and photography) i barely engage in unless i have to. There’s always this voice telling me im not good enough, nor will i ever be.

I’m 21 and live with my mom and brother. My mom is an ex-addict who was using most my life and constantly had my siblings and i questioning if she’s sober or not. (She was dozing off in-front of us, we knew she wasn’t clean but we wanted to live with her so we hoped she was clean if that makes sense) During the time all this was going on my dad was taking care of my siblings and I. He would be on and off drugs as well but was sober when my mom wasn’t. He starting struggling and felt it was unfair for him to take care of us by himself which resorted into him relapsing into drugs as well. He would also beat my sister occasionally if she didn’t clean the house or cook when she was only 11/12. Once my dad relapsed he stopped working and got us evicted. We bounced from couches to hotels every night. Eventually my aunt agreed to take my sister in. My brother and I moved with my mom in hopes to start fresh again. (my mom was fresh out of jail so she was sober) The new spot was fine at first but eventually she relapsed and we were homeless again. I have so many traumatic experiences starting from playing the trumpet on the street to earn rent money while my grandma was high on xans cursing at everyone to walking in on my mom shooting up herion with the needle in hand. Long story short I’m a little messed now that I’m older. My mom is now sober and we live in a stable house and we have been for the last 6 years. We never got any counseling or anything like that we all kinda just shoved the past under the rug. I used to be really depressed to the point where I thought d*ing would be better than living. I only had 1 girlfriend when I was 17 and haven’t had one since. I have no friends because I pushed them all away. I have over racing thoughts every night of what I’m gonna do with my life. Lots of times I find myself blaming my parents for all this stuff wrong with me (which I know is childish). I feel like if I had a stable life and I was in school instead of moving around everywhere my life wouldn’t be how it is today. My parents both had really bad childhoods too so I try not to blame them too much but I feel like they should’ve been stronger and at some point got there shit together earlier for my siblings and I.

Long story short, me (assistant manager)

My boss made me lose my job because she encouraged not just me but our whole team to steal. She comfort us in a way to make it seem okay to steal. Ofc I listen to her because she is my boss but not knowing the consequences me and my whole team will face later.
When judgement day came, some of my girls in team were very upset and thought it was unfair for me to get fired and that it should’ve been just our boss because she literally encouraged/gaslit us 
but it was LP decision. None of the girls in my  team got fired but are now fighting to take my position and my bosses 🙄

1697240224.0,I reached my all time low today and then it just…disappeared,"I normally feel depressed and empty all day, every day, and I get this weird feeling in my chest for a few seconds at a time periodically throughout the day. Today I woke up with this really weird feeling of anxiety. There was a strange feeling in my chest, like when you get jumpscared, like normal. But this time it persisted almost the whole day. I had trouble focusing and I felt terrified and stressed basically all day. I started scratching myself on the arm hard to relieve the tension periodically. But when I got home, it all kind of went away. Why? What’s going on with me? I don’t understand. Now I’m questioning if it really happened because I’ve returned to my normal depressed state instead of the severity I experienced earlier today.",mentalhealth
1697269384.0,How do I get more help for depression/anxiety?,"Hi all! I was looking for support in the form of what in the world should I be doing to get more help? What does the path look like? There's a lot going on with me and im verbose, which can understandably irritate some people so if you want to stop here before context I understand! The main question is just what is a concrete path to finding more about the root cause of my depression and anxiety so that it can be tackled more efficiently?

I'm in therapy currently, I really like this style (somatic) and therapist, she has taught me a lot. I've done DBT and talk therapy in the past too. My mental health, which I have basically always struggled with, has improved a lot since high school. I was raised in an abusive/dysfunctional household, and I also suspect maybe being born with something that was never diagnosed. But... its still effecting my life and now relationship negatively at 25. I seem to have a cycle of maybe 1-2 weeks holding it together, then start to get increasingly overwhelmed by stress caused by work, chores, socializing, life events, plain ol pointless background anxiety etc until im past my tolerance level and am just an anxious overstimulated mess, then depressed mess as a result of that, for 2-4 weeks.

I am at the point that my partner of 8 years is overwhelmed by me and my ""constant"" stress/overthinking/negativity. I understand. It hurts nonetheless. He needs me to take more steps to control these spirals. Its at the point that he is so spent from my stress cycles that as im approaching them - i notice them earlier due to my somatic therapy -  and try so hard to keep it under control, he is getting frustrated with me after only a few days, which makes me feel unsupported and isolated, so i spiral faster and harder since i feel like im suffering and being blamed/invalidated. Again, I understand the position hes in. Thats just my perspective.

So his plan is trying to find professionals that can help me find the root cause - lifestyle, hormone levels, chemical imbalance, comorbid conditions, diagnosis etc so i can find solutions to deal with it on top of weekly therapy. Medication terrifies me, but im open to it.

I jumped the gun last week after another fight, since i still hadnt contacted any professionals since our last fight, I emailed and did a phone consult with a psychologist (thought it was a psychiatrist at first) my therapist referred me to. I say jumped the gun, because i made the phone consult for 2 days later after an unusual 6am workshift on 4 hours of sleep, without discussing with my therapist any of it or organizing any of my notes.. I was trying to show my partner im taking him seriously, and i have social anxiety/phone phobia so I was trying to bite the bullet so i couldnt put it off. Bad idea, basically feel like i choked. I had such a hard time understanding the evaluations he offers even after an hour on the phone. In the end I was offered an autism evaluation (which i inquired about, I suspect it or adhd) and a neuropsych eval instead of psych eval? Which doesnt sound right, it may be because i mentioned autism/adhd?

I'm going to discuss this next week with my therapist properly. But until then i would love some advice or support, Im going nuts knowing im hurting my partner so much, feeling really down about feeling broken/wrong/like a victim tbh, even like an imposter now that im in an upswing after an honestly really bad downswing. And completely anxious, even irritated that i just have no idea what im doing. The path isnt clear and not knowing what im doing is a huge trigger. My therapist even suggested getting a psych evaluation isnt the way to go - I thought getting a proper eval therefore mental illness diagnosis would be the first step to open up resources for care plans?

Im really just...lost. Thanks for reading if you did.

1697282733.0,i think i am ready to settle into the disappointment mentality,"
i am here to lay it all out and pour my truth and soul into this, and ask for your genuine feedback

I really feel like i am screwed. i am going to be completely transparent and say that i am most definitely an asshole, who is selfish/ greedy and most definitely a narcissist. For some reason i have this narrative in my head that everyone and everything around me is solely focused on picking out my flaws and my issues even though i know that nobody actually cares.  i work so hard to look like and be like my “own character” or my “own self” but i always feel like i am copying someone else. i feel like people are constantly watching my every move and waiting to pick out my issues and put them on display for everyone else to see. I feel like this is impartially to do with the fact that a lot of people see me as fake and unreal and this is because of the fact that as i was growing up this was quite literally the only thing I presented to people. I presented myself as a fake person and then people started to see that, but my issue lies within the fact that once people see that, or once people see you for that negative light that you once were people dont ever really stop seeing that. its like you have no chance at improving or ever becoming something else in someone’s eyes because thats the only light they will ever view you in. Once you make a mistake it seems like thats all that people will ever see you for and so i feel like i kind of have a right to live up to that expectation now maybe? is that wrong of me to feel that way? i feel like its kind of showing how weak and insecure i am. almost like in the sense of how instead of choosing to get better i feel like i just have to live up to the bleak standards that people have for me. i have always felt like this when it comes to my parents or family especially. For some important context i was adopted as a 2 year old from an extremely abusive and neglected environment. i was told that i witnessed my birth father abuse my birth mother and was subjected to that abuse myself. now i know this doesn’t really mean anything, but i have always felt like the little things like this really shaped my mind into the shit show that it is today. I cannot for the life of me understand and really develop what love is and it absolutely horrifies me every night. I sit awake and ball my eyes out because I don’t understand how i simply cannot comprehend how to love someone. its not just even romantic relationships, its family and friendships aswell. for some reason i just can’t seem to connect with anyone on that level of mutual love on respect i know i am supposed to have, but i just simply don’t. love is something your supposed to just have and not supposed to feel like you have to have it. i feel like i am supposed to love those people (ie my family) instead of just loving them. and this is how i feel with people who i even have the balls to let get close to me. which by the way if i haven’t set that up well enough yet, i am now. I really dont let people get close to me. I feel like it makes me weak and vulnerable and every-time i have tried that, i feel like i just always end up losing. i always end up losing more of myself that what i thought i signed up for and i feel like its slowly eating away at my mental health. i feel like i have to love instead of just doing so. yet when it comes to some random person i don’t even know, or someone off of the streets (ie homeless people or people who seem to have “less”)  i feel like i need to give all the care and all of everything i can give to them to them. i feel like its kind of my duty as someone who has more to give to those who have less or aren’t able to get more and i feel like that ties back into the narcissism that i feel like ive got. i feel like an asshole and I really despise myself because i feel like thats all i have ever known to feel about myself. i am mean, i put my parents through hell as a kid and they still would come back to my screams and tantrums. they would come back to me cursing them out and giving them hell ever chance i got and we would just always end up in the same vicious cycle that i feel like i have always known since i was that 2 year old girl. i know i am doomed and my mind is broken and my views are very warped. ive got a lot of baggage and i hate myself for it, but i am hre asking for help because I don’t know what to do. i feel stuck in this cycle of carnage and i feel hopeless. i need help",mentalhealth

The problem is that it's not that I am brave and know what I am doing, it's just I don't think anyone would care if I just vanish from the face of earth. I am mostly careless because I think ""It's not like it will affect anyone even if you die"". Deep down I know that I am not a good person and no one would ever come along who would actually like me.

1697257643.0,i am nearly 18 years old and i can't empathize with people,"so, the title may sound a bit funny  but anyway. since i was a child i feel like i can't empathize enough with people and that isn't something i worry but i find it rather curious about myself.

 i haven't had much contact with other people either, so i never directly learned how to emotionally behave with people the right way like having a strong vinculum; so much so i can easily cut off (or ghost) people even if we know each other for years. 

i was raised separately from other children, my parents weren't much present in my childhood as well as most of my family (that loves calling me a weirdo ever since). i barely remember my parents unless when they were like fighting bc they fought a lot. 

mother told me to be always kind to everyone even if i don't mean it and that's what i usually do. i smile, i nod, i got a sweet voice on (i'm a female), i lie. i was also told that empathizing with others was the right thing to do, even if they were my enemies, but there is; i can't. i didn't think it was natural because people told me it wasn't but i also didn't reflect about it. it's not like i thought all day about how they felt or put myself on their place and this is the hardest to me.

i already hurt a “friend” (i have some difficulty w/ using the word friend w/ anyone lol) with something i said related to a trauma she has; it wasn't directly to her but somehow she felt bad about it since apparently it was related to a trauma of hers. i was called out by her partner and by pure pressure, i apologized; but deep inside i didn't want. i ignored her for a whole week after that bc she made my ugly ass apologize like why i should it? i didn't say it directly to her but anyway we are in good terms now but i still can't feel bad for that and sometimes i feel like i will probably hurt her and others again someday because i don't mind my own words.

i heard them talking about their problems but didn't feel like it was important. i don't know if i can say it's narcissistic but, it wasn't about me and it wasn't my problem so i thought it wasn't important. i was just acting like my mother told me. to hear people and be nice.

 i tell people not to empathize with me because i probably can't feel for them either. i've already wrongly disdained of other people's traumas, even when me myself was neglected and felt abandoned by my family so i dont think anyone should really care about my traumas  or problems. a lot of people still hear me and it's surprising because i directly tell them they shouldn't really care.

to me it depends a lot. i feel like i can feel bad for children and babies; but teenagers and adults i couldn't really care much for them, or what happens to them. i can't even feel guilty for not caring about others in a deeper way and by others i also include certain family members.

in fact, inside my family; most precisely my father, has some issue with not expressing empathy and guilt/remorse. i don't know if it's genetical but, sometimes i think my environment played a huge role as well.

maybe is normal not to care about  some things isn't it?  i was told to get professional help fast as i could've a personality disorder (i don't really considerate any of it) but i am just completing 17 years by this year and next year is when i am 18. to older people or anyone who can relate to me, do you have any thoughts about it? you can be mean if you want 🤓☝️",mentalhealth
1697265115.0,"I had a revelation, but at 39... So whats the point?","I'm a 39yr old divorced male. I've pretty much met all my goals I had in life. I had a son, I've achieved my dream job as a Welding Engineer shortly after some time in military intelligence (35L). But I've never been overall happy... About 3 years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive Type, which explained a lot but didn't answer all the questions of why I'm like the way I am; indifferent to anything and everything. I assume depression has it's hand in it as well because I have either lost altogether or at times, the will to do anything I used to enjoy. I was an avid guitar player and collector, they've all been collecting dust for at least 3 years now. My life consists of going to work, then coming to an empty house with my two boxers. I just end up doom scrolling on my phone until it gets late, then I take a shower then go to bed. Even on the weekends this is about as exciting as my routine gets. I have no friends circle, I don't go out besides for things like groceries. Outside of work the only communication I have with other people is online to a very select few. 

A few seemingly random event's and thoughts that came up recently forced me to look inward for my problems. I don't want to go into detail because it will distract my train of thought. But the topic of empathy came up while I was speaking to a friend online and as I just finished telling her how I can only think of two times in my life I've ever woken up in the morning feeling rested. Since we were talking about empathy, I realized there's only two times in my life that I've felt what I understand as empathy. Once involved my son being sick and another involved my senior dog... 

I think I'm a sociopath.

I don't have all the characteristics that immediately would make one think sociopathy. But I have the majority of them such as: Impulsive behavior, Trouble with responsibilities, Generally superficial relationships, Difficulty recognizing emotion, Lack of empathy for others, and emotional detachment. There's ones I don't relate to like heavy drinking or abusing drugs (I swear drugs just don't work on me, I've tried every stimulant under the sun with zero effects. It has made me wonder in the past if my dopamine receptors even work.), constant lying, deception and manipulation. I may not care how someone feels overall. But I have a sense of fairness, and I don't see that as fair.  

I just don't know where to go from here. I feel like I'm too old and too set in my ways and I highly doubt there's effective treatment. Especially therapy, I tried it for anger management in my late teens and I just couldn't take it seriously. But I've lived 39 years without being happy, at least anything beyond excitement over an event or achievement, nothing that lasted over 24 hours. I don't see a point, I just understand the problem that has no solution.

1697276625.0,Living a bad life,"Just gonna be honest from the top, here: this is gonna be a long, structureless, pointless rant. Your time would definitely be better spent on pretty much anything other than reading this post. It’ll be a miracle if my shame doesn’t see me take down this post within just a few minutes of it going live, anyways.

To introduce myself: I’m a (currently) fat white guy. 27, going on 28 - and I really don’t want to live to see thirty. Not out of some fear of the future, or losing my youth… none of that stuff really matters to me. I guess if I could put why I feel that way into words, it comes from a strange sort of hope. That I could maybe get just one good thing out of my life; maybe some sympathy for having died “young”. Maybe to add to some sad statistic that might weigh on others’ minds, and maybe change the way they treat the less fortunate. Something. I don’t think there’s any other good I can do in this life anymore. Just too tired and bitter for anything else

Just gonna keep laying out my grievances from here. Personal woes - not even touching upon how much the world’s best me down. Everyone deals with that, of course.

For starters: I’m ugly. I won’t let anyone argue with me about that, or ask me to post face, just so they can judge for themselves. I’ve always known it. I see myself in the mirror every day, after all. And, removed from my own perspective, I’ve also been told by strangers (online and irl), friends, family, etc. Even managed to wrestle that admission out of my mom, some years ago. 

I don’t know how I got beat with the ugly stick so hard, since everyone else on both sides of my family at least look average… but yeah, I indisputably was. Crooked and upturned nose, misshapen head, slim and “scary” eyes, weak jaw… the list goes on and on. And that’s just my face! That’s not even bringing up the rest of my disgusting body. Chronic acne starting in my teenage years that I’ve never been able to fight off, even with all the medications and dermatologist tips in the world. Plenty of deep scarring from that, too. That, and from ingrown hairs and boils, cysts, etc. The skin I live in alone makes waking up unpleasant.

I’m also poor, have a wide array of chronic health issues, and I’m asexual. That last one is probably a blessing at least, because I’ve never had to deal with sexual frustration. Nope… just your average crippling loneliness, and the fear of what’ll happen if I somehow outlive the only person who really cares about me (my mom).

I said I’m currently fat in the beginning, and yeah - I am, for now. I’ve fluctuated from being skinny to fat since I hit puberty, and I even had a short phase in my teen years where I was pretty “in shape”, all things considered. It didn’t improve my body image, but I figured it’d be worth pursuing.

It took until last year for me to work up the energy to pursue getting a GED, and even that just felt like a waste of time in the end. I’m still just gonna be working dead-end jobs forever - and with how little I’ve got going, I don’t see that changing anytime soon. I’ve got zero motivation to try and better myself, frankly. I don’t see how I could make this life redeemable.

To close this whole tirade out: I’ll just say that I’ve never really felt like I’ve had any real reason(s) to live. Frankly, I feel so inhuman internally that I’m amazed to not have been deemed autistic or anything like that by any of the counselors or therapists I’ve blown money on over the years. The only diagnoses that have stuck are MDD, and complete anhedonia (starting around 7 years old). 

The only treatment left that I’d say would have any potential to “help” me would potentially be magic mushrooms… which aren’t legal in the state I live currently. I’ve mentioned this before on Reddit and elsewhere online, resulting in multiple people contacting me with offers to sell them or be my psychonaut - but I’d prefer to try them in a professional medical environment. Which isn’t currently available to me at the moment, for the variety of reasons I’ve laid out above (legality, financials, inherent drive, etc)

My existence has been so utterly sad to witness that it’s resulted in my mom falling out of religion. I rendered her inconsolable for several months at age 14, when after a severe mental break and prolonged stay at a mental health facility, I told her that I felt “life maybe just isn’t for everyone”. She came out of that experience having grappled with her faith, now profoundly atheist and spiritually detached. I felt bad about it at the time, and tried to convince her that I’m perhaps being punished for misdeeds in a prior life - but I don’t think that kind of gnostic belief could ever connect with her on any level.

I know I cause her excruciating emotional pain, and that used to depress me - but I just don’t have the bandwidth for that now, I guess.

I’m just going to cut things off here, ‘cause I could genuinely keep dumping my thoughts forever. I’m just as weepy when I’m not drunk, anyways. Thanks for reading, I guess.

For many years now, maybe about 3, I have had an imaginary girlfriend in my head. I talk to her, mostly when I'm alone. For example, when playing video games or watching movies. She has a full name and likes and dislikes, and I know exactly what she looks like. I know all her family members and when she was born, stuff like that. She's kind and let's me be open to her. She's kind of like the 'perfect' partner I guess. What's even more odd, though, is that she doesn't refer to me by name. Whenever I'm talking to her I pretend I'm another character I made up. I'm 17 now (almost 18 in a few months) and I feel like I'm getting too old for this. I've always had imaginary friends (sort of) since I was in elementary school but they were mostly at night, before bed. I talk to her every single day. Not out loud, just in my head. 

Both of these imaginary people started out as characters in a book I was writing back in middle school. I always thought I was just being creative and brainstorming but I haven't wrote in over a year and have no interest in it but she's still here. 

I have a few friends and I enjoy being with them, but I don't have many. When I'm with them I rarely think about her, if at all. I'm also an only child, if that helps.

1697253676.0,Feeling No Longer Capable of Living a Normal Life,"I feel I need someone else's perspective on something bothering me. The person I usually talk to is currently on maternity leave and I literally have no one to talk to. Sometimes sharing stuff online backfires at you but I'm trying my luck here. 

I'm 42. I grew up a positive, happy girl with lots of ambitions and dreams, though lonely in my surroundings, being almost an only child. My one wish was to grow up fast so that I can have a companion in life. Never felt my childhood was similar to other people my age, because I was surrounded by people way older who fulfilled a traditional social castes. At a very young age, I watched my siblings get married, have kids, deal with adult problems. I figured that was automatically what I was also supposed to do--grow up, fall in love, have kids, and deal with a conventional life. 

During my adult life, I couldn't settle for what people around me wanted me to settle for. Because I come from a very small closely-knitted community, people surrounding you usually set you up and everyone becomes involved in everyone else's business. As much as I felt happy being in my surrounding and around others, I never felt understood well. I was usually a supporter--the babysitter, wonderful aunt, obedient family member--I did what others wanted to me do; I went along with everyone's expectations just to avoid conflicts, but deep down I wasn't sharing or communicating on an equal level. I felt it was a mistake to conform, because that meant I was adapting; and not really resonating with who I really am. At the same time, I didn't have the social or life skills to pursue my own thing. I just stayed within my environment, refused to conform or settle, and continued dreaming of a day when I magically stumble on what I regarded my perfect life would be. 

So much has happened in my 20s and 30s. The biggest turning point was getting tangled up with bad friends, obsessive, narcissistic personalties, and abusive/controlling ones. Drama, stress, and tension made me want to avoid conflict more than anything and that propelled me to get back into my own shell to stay safe. Due to being psychologically/emotionally abused as a child by a relative outside my immediate comfort zone, I lost my ability to trust people. I grew up into an adult who constantly felt targeted due to the horrible experiences I've been through (obsession, stalking, plotting to ruin my life). I decided to remove myself completely from the spotlight and just live quietly. I stopped socializing, I stopped mingling, I stopped being spontaneous, I stopped doing anything that puts me out there in the spotlight and at risk of being a target. That made me feel safe. 

Fast forward to my 40s now and life is so difficult. I'm still in my immediate surrounding being a caregiver. I wouldn't change it for anything. I genuinely accepted that being a wife, mother, or someone's partner in life is simply just not in it in the cards for me. I made peace with that. 

I'm busy doing my own thing--hobbies, keeping my space organized, gardening, and settling into middle age. There are days when it's immensely difficult due to physical pain that suddenly took over my life. I suffer from horrible neck pain that is making my life miserable. There are days where I can't sleep, sit, or do simple things. I can't read or study. I can't sit on a desk and try to learn something new. It's an on and off switch. One day I'm fine; the next I'm feeling crippled. 

I got used to picking myself up. I no longer expect anyone to understand my pain or tailor to my depression. Sure, sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and give myself a pathetic 2 or 3 minutes of crying with the woes of ""why me, why couldn't I have someone to just help ease this pain--just say something nice to me or make me feel safe"", but then I just flip, get up, tell myself to suck it up and move on. I'm good at that now. 

Since I graduated from grad school, I've been toying with the idea of getting a pet. It's like having a baby fever or something. I've had cats and close connections to cats my whole life except for the past decade or so, when I discovered I have mild allergies. I still toyed with the idea of having a companion. I remember how nice it felt waking up in the morning when you feel your worst and thinking, ""I can't afford to be depressed, my cat needs me"" or ""I'm feeling like shit right now, I need to be around my cat and just forget everything"". I miss that feeling so much. 

A few years back, I shared that urge of getting a pet with a close friend who wasn't supportive of the idea at all. I felt hurt, because whenever I shared something I was doing--still studying despite being in my late 30s at the time or wanting to get a cat, it was always met with some kind of unsupportive remarks. The biggest slap to me was, ""cats are bad luck, why are you getting one?"". She went into details about why they're bad luck and till this day, I can't forget that conversation. I'm not superstitious and on a logical sphere, I know it's crap, but it affected me so much, I began synthesizing stuff happening based on her theory, ""oh no, a negative incident did happen when I was in contact with a cat that one time--could what she's saying be true?"". 

It sounds so bizarre and illogical, but I think it just resonated with a pre-existing fear of always having things ruined for me. It intensified that hesitation, more fears and doubts in me. It's ironic, because she struggled so much to be a parent. She must know how it feels to want that maternal feeling. I already expressed to me, having a cat is like having a baby. My motivation is to fill a void inside of me that feels so cold and emotionless. I feel dead inside. 

While I pushed aside her words and moved on with my life, I still find myself incapable of making simple decisions like this. It made me self-reflect and realize I'm no longer capable of making simple decisions normal people make everyday. 

I found the cutest kitten the other day and contacted the person. It was so difficult to push myself to do it. I figured--that's it. Just do it. You have the experience, you have the means. It's a chance to bond with a best-friend, feel human, develop healthy emotional connections, etc. 

I still can't do it. 

""You barely have energy to lift yourself up on sick days, how will you be able to handle a cat"", ""what if you decide this and then realize you can't have a pet"", ""what if it gets too much; you're not used to having a creature (human or animal) around you 24/7""

I would never put my own selfish gains before an animal's and I would rather get hurt than hurting someone else, so I just decided not to get a pet anymore, but deep down I'm so hurt. 

I'm probably going to be fine accepting this as a new reality similar to letting go of a dozen other wants in life. I just can't help feeling like crap. I feel like the safest thing for me is to continue living like this, alone and deprived from any healthy emotional connection with either human or pet. It made me realize how difficult life has become for me. I have gotten so used to avoiding conflict to feel safe, I'm scared of making decisions in life. And due to more complications like health hiccups, I feel more incapable now. It's awful. 

I guess that brings a level of feeling some kind injustice. Like the best part of my life were robbed from me, either by others or my own self-sabotage. I'm probably over amplifying things right now, because I feel very emotionally vulnerable right now. I'm probably going to reread this later and roll my eyes. I just felt like I needed to give myself the chance to pour it all out and tell myself it's okay to feel like shit and sound like shit for a little while.

1697239701.0,I’m Spiraling,"I started college a month ago and was really excited for a chance to make new friends. I always feel like I messed up my chance at making friends in elementary school by how I behaved. However, I feel like everyone but me has made at least one friend. 

I became an RA (resident advisor) before school and moved in three weeks before everyone else. I get on okay with the other RA's but none of them are in my course and I don't hang out with them outside the job. The other residence never invite me to anything, despite me seeing them hanging out on the floor. Whenever I pass by, or say hello, they go quiet and I overhear them say 'it's the RA'. The only person who I would consider an acquaintance (one of my residents) will strike up a convo with me in passing but other then that we never talk. I attended the start of term events for making friends and got peoples socials, however that doesn't have seemed to done anything to help. 

I know that I might not be the most interesting person, especially at an art school, but I feel like this has been happening all my life. On any sports team I only make acquaintances with my teammates and at any job/school I've been to I've really only ever had two friends. One of them is currently in a different province and the other is swamped in schoolwork so I never see either of them, and it's hard to find time to talk to either of them.

It's starting to really get to me and I can feel myself spiralling (this is just a part of it). idk what to do.

1697256405.0,Do i have bpd?,"

I just want to tell you why i think i may have bpd and what got me into it, so if you can help, tell me if this could be bpd or not. i don't have access to therapy so i can't get professionals thoughts  on it , i know without professional it is practically improssible to know for sure  and there is not much you can say but i just want to know if   this could be it (i should probably  add that i am 17 and i know at this age you cant really get diagnosed with it but still...).

 I have always described myself as an ustable person and one time i was watching a movie and in that movie they described this one girl as an ustable, and as someone who changes her mind often and as someone who doesn't really know exactly what they want and something like that and they said that she had bpd, so this description felt a little too personal so i decided to get more information about bpd, when i read the symptoms, some of them made so much sense , some of them not so much. The ones that really made me think about it was the chronic feelings of emptiness and  unstable self- image or sense of self. I have always felt empty and i feel like no matter what i do, nothing will fill this void inside me, it just follows me.also i have never really understood who i was, in the past it was hard to even say what did i do in my free time and what my hobbies were, it got better, now i think i know what i enjoy doing in my free time but still i have this weird feeling like i don't know who i am and i cant even describe this feeling very well. I  have never attempted suicide, i used to self harm but i never intended to harm myself seriously, it was just the way of dealing with everything.it was the way of grounding myself and the way to fight my emptiness.I know that dissociation is one of the symptoms of bpd but my dissociation is so bad that i think i may have separate disorder like DPDR i have the feeling like i have had this my whole life and its just constant there is no time where it goes away. These are the thing that i strongly relate but there are also things that i dont relate or don't know if i relate or not. For example fear of abandonment, in my childhood i was not abandoned, i don't really understand if i have this or not. I feel like people with fear of abandonment are kinda clingy but i am totally opposite, if i have the feeling that someone doesn't want to spent time with me and they are about to abandon me ( i cant really trust my feeling about these things cause even slightest things makes me think that they want to abandon me) i get really distant, i try to totally cut them out of my life. Communication is real problem for me, especially when it comes to my feelings. I am not sure about the emotional instabiliy either, i feel like under my every feeling and emotion  is just again emptiness. I dont know about splitting either, it is really hard for me to connect with poeple and to be comfortable with them so i can't really express my emotions that clearly towards them, i have this one close friend, and sometimes i feel really amazed by them and i am glad that i am friends with them and other times i feel  idk how to say but like almost disgusted by them. I dont know if it is bpd thing or just regular. People with bpd are really expressive and explosive and things like that and i am nothing like that, that makes me think that i dont have it.I never express anger, a lot of people have said that they have never seen me angry or even upset. i wouldn't say that i have a problem with controlling my emotions.

At first she was asked out on a date by a guy in our class and after she rejected him and informed him she had a bf he apologised and backed off which I would have thought was the best course of action. 

She then become upset that said person was giving her space and not approaching like he normally did , the other girls in our circle reminded her that it was perfectly normal for him to give her space considering what had happened. 

She then decided to send him a long message about how rude it was of him to “ignore her” despite him starting to say hi again and sit with our group in lectures again a couple days later. She told him that he was being rude and that he had no right to ignore her. The other girls and i told her she was being really harsh towards him as we thought space was exactly what she wanted.

1697246065.0,Caught feelings for a girl I barely knew and I can’t stop thinking about her,There’s this girl at school who I had liked since I saw her for the first time. Well about two weeks pass since I first see her and I decide to approach her and ask for her socials to get to know each other and whatnot. So I go up to her during lunch and start a conversation with her and things go surprisingly well to the point I thought it was a dream. I’m not even kidding when I say that everything felt so natural as if it was meant to happen. Well things go well I get her socials and I send her a message so we start talking over text as well. This goes on for a couple days and one day after school we talk about going over to her place to hang out for a while and maybe smoke a bit if that’s the mood. Also yes I know smoking isn’t good for me especially when I’m still in high school but I only do it once every couple months and at most a couple times every like two months. Anyway we get out of school and head over to hers where we hang out for a bit before things get more inappropriate to put it in a sfw way. Things happen it was good and after we walk over to a park near where she lives for around half an hour before I head home. Everything felt so surreal as if I would wake up at any moment and realize it had all been a dream. I laid down on a bench and had my head on her lap while she played with my hair. We talked and laughed and she would occasionally go down to kiss me. It really was the happiest I had been for a while even after that day we continued to talk and hang out in and out of school. Well until about a week and a half after that day that she suddenly changed and didn’t want to talk to me. She didn’t talk to me for most of the day but near the end of the day she apologized for it and said she was just having some problems and was in a bad mood. Whatever right? I say it’s ok and we start talking again like usual. The next day I decide to skip 6th and 7th period and she says she wants to go with me so we sneak out of school and we talk while we’re out walking to a park near our school. It was strange though that she kept bringing up why I liked her and why I was interested in her but I told her truthfully what I thought. She seemed happy but like she felt bad about it too. Around 3 or 4 hours pass and out of nowhere she says she wants to leave. I ask what’s up and she says she isn’t good and just wants to leave me but doesn’t want to hurt me. I tell her to leave if she wants and she walks away while I just sit there and watch. In the moment my first reaction was to laugh for some reason but I went completely silent after. It didn’t really hit me until the next day that I woke up feeling like complete shit knowing I just lost the first girl I was ever so interested in.  I woke up to no messages from her and honestly it felt awful. It’s been I think about a month by now and I really don’t feel any better about it.

1697263674.0,I do not exist.,"Legally speaking, I do exist. I have physical proof of my existence, but it’s almost as if it’s just chicken scratch on a piece of paper.

When you do something wrong or different, people usually look. For example, if you were to walk into the wrong classroom, the students in the class would glance at you, nothing your unprompted presence, If I, however, were to walk into the wrong classroom, nobody would bat an eye. If my existence isn’t acknowledged by others, should I even acknowledge it myself? Perhaps I am just a fragment of somebody’s thoughts, an imaginary friend.

This invisibility is nothing new. I’ve been avoided my entire life. During my elementary years, the only people who talked to me were my teachers and my single friend. And although I claim that I’m not actually here, this single friend was the only person that saw me. Maybe I was her imaginary friend.

This feeling of inclusion was blinding. This friend of mine was incredibly toxic. And when I say that, I don’t mean your average “she spread rumors about me” or “she forced me to do drugs.” This girl, this *monster*, that I befriended was so much worse. As much as I’d love to go into the details, this post would be more like an autobiography, proving her unhealthy prominence in my life. I’d like to blame her for my severe alienation, but it must be deeper than that. One thing is for sure: she definitely did not help the case.

I know I’ve always been a little different, for better or for worse, but I’ve always been told that “we’re all special in our own ways,” so I brushed it off. Unfortunately for me, what makes me unique isn‘t special at all. Rather, it’s more of a curse, being so “unique” that complete and utter loneliness follow me no matter where I go. Despite saying that I’ve been purposefully ignored for as long as I can remember, I did get more attention when I was younger. However, I think the loneliness built on top of each other, eventually leading me to isolate myself without even realizing it. But I don’t want to be isolated. I want to be seen, to be heard, to be *acknowledged*.

People know me, yes, but they don’t know me as a *person*. I haven’t met a single person who has even come up with the idea that I have emotions. Whenever I try to display emotions to people I thought I could trust, I’m met with people’s faces cringing, and an “okay..?” Or they just turn my emotions into their own, usually by claiming their situation is worse. I’m a huge people-pleaser, usually at my own expense, and therefore when people do see me, they see me as an asset. Nobody knows my favorite color, my hobbies, my interests, etc. And it’s not like I don’t try to share. Whenever I try to tell people about about myself, I either get bored looks or interrupted  by people saying that I shouldn’t always talk about myself, when in reality, I’ve barely made it a word past “I.” (Unfortunately this post does not help support this.) Due to this, I’ve stopped talking about myself altogether. People love to talk about themselves, no matter how boring they are. The only things I say are in response to somebody’s selfishness, such as useless advice, useless commentary, or anything useless for a useless story that they say because fhey’ve run out of material. Unfortunately their lack of words doesn’t offer me any chance to speak about myself.

There’s nothing more I want than attention. (This paragraph might be a little controversial or triggering so this is my content warning.) Everybody wants attention, as it’s part of human nature, but when somebody is extremely deprived of it, they become desperate. I would do anything for acknowledgement. I’d allow myself to get bullied, I’d be fine with getting a chronic illness, I’d purposely allow myself to get injured, I’d even kill somebody if it really meant that people would pay attention to me. (I probably won’t kill anybody, I think that it’s just a reoccurring intrusive thought I get.) Sometimes I wish something terrible would happen to me, just so somebody would look my way and maybe even say “sorry,” whether it be for my condition or how ignorant they are.

I’d like to add that it’s not depersonalization or dissociation. I see through my eyes and my eyes only. There is no feeling of being in a dream-like state, or viewing myself through third person.

And to add evidence to my claim of invisibility, here are some situations that have happened to me, just in the past week:

\- I was sitting at a table with three other people. Two people were going to go somewhere together when the third person, still sitting down, claimed they didn’t want to be alone. But they weren’t alone. I was there. Not a single person at that table even glanced in my direction. Nobody said my name. Naturally, as normal humans do, they all went together and left me by myself, as per usual.

\- In class, the teacher asked a question, expecting students to raise their hands in order to answer. However, nobody did, so I raised mine, as I knew the answer. I’ve never risen my hand in this class before as most people usually have their hands raised before mine and I don’t stand a chance against them. Anyways, the teacher looked around the room, disappointed, and decided to just on somebody random, disregarding my arm firmly raised towards the ceiling.

\- In class, we had to “talk with our shoulder partner” regarding the lecture, and I spoke, actively trying to participate in class, but with no response from my counterpart. Not even eye contact. In fact, I couldn’t even see their eyes. I was looking at them, trying to converse, but they were faced forward, their hair seeming to cover nothing but the eye.

\- I went to get lunch from the cafeteria and was confused about one of the foods they were serving. Naturally, I asked approached to ask a question. At my school, the lunch servers usually to comvey to others what they’re serving, as there are several meals offered per day. I walked up to this guy advertising his section via voice and began to speak. At first, I thought he didn’t hear me, so I spoke louder. And louder. He never looked at me. If he had saw me, he would have at least tried to serve me food like he was to other kids.

I was only expecting this post to be a paragraph or two long, but when given a voice, I try my best to milk it of every opportunity. I have so many words locked up inside of me without a key. And if anybody read this whole thing, kudos to you! By the way, if anybody has anything I should research to find out more about this—possible mental disorders, causes, treatments, communities, etc.— please let me know because even though I find comfort in it, I hate this alienated way of living so very badly.

1697263025.0,How do you survive having to go without your much needed mental health meds,"I hate the nurse practitioner so much. She's withholding my Lexapro until I can go and do a full panel fasting lab where they look at my organ function. I'm down to one pill. Idk when is it gonna be the right moment to take it, because I can't remember how long it takes to get lab results. They said I don't get the refills until the results are in. I have something important going on next week and I don't know if I'll be stable. Emotional dysregulation for me feels awful. I'm afraid one day I'll make me snap at someone or say something hurtful.

1697248937.0,Am I creating depression?,"I don’t really know where to start or how to explain so this is my word vomit rant; if you stay till the end, thanks. 

I feel like I don’t give a shit about anything, but when something happens I spiral and sob and freak out. 

I play games with my boyfriend that I can’t play by myself and if he doesn’t play with me I lose my ever loving shit. I’ll ask him to play and if he says “not right now” I’ll bug him later and then get mad if he says no but then he doesn’t wanna play BECAUSE I freak out so I have to not freak out even though I am freaking out and if I say anything about it it becomes worse and I just spiral into doom. 

I will get really fucking mad about whatever and want to punch or throw or break something or hurt myself and when he tries to tell me to calm down and stop I lose it and walk off but I don’t wanna walk off and I feel like I have absolutely no fucking control over anything.

He says things like I just tell myself I can’t do it and it’s easy to blame other things/people then myself but it doesn’t feel like I’m blaming things it feels like there’s something WRONG with me. 

I don’t make enough money to go to therapy, and realistically, when I have, it only helps for a little bit and then it feels like I’m just talking about the same shit all the time, and my meds have been the same for like a decade and my doctor is hesitant to change it and so am I really. 

I am a teacher and I am constantly overworked and over stressed and I do my job 150% and it is so much and then we argue over my sleeping or eating or spending money, like I have a lot of bad habits that he’s trying to help me fix but he holds me to such high standards that sometimes I feel like a failure to him and even though I don’t think he really feels that way, sometimes I just want him to leave me alone and sometimes I have the most appreciation for how he is to me.

Some moments I am fully thankful and happy and the most excited to have him care as much as he does and some moments I hate the whole world and don’t give a shit about anything and then immediately spiral into self hate and unaliving thoughts and how terrible I am and I just feel lost and stuck and confused and I don’t know what to do or if I’m okay or what.",mentalhealth

1697246382.0,Effects of an overbearing mother,"So my mother has always been controlling. She says she has bad anxiety and stuff, shes prescribed medication but doesn’t really take it. I’ve had issues with her for years but I am now going to be 20 soon and am in college. I’ve tried expressing my feelings and how it affects me before but any sort of criticism like that she takes as an attack and gets emotionally abusive, as she tends to do. Shes been like that as long as I can remember and I think it has really affected me in terms of development.

 Past a certain point I became ruled by anxiety too. I have a hard time saying no to people, I have a hard time connecting and communicating with people, especially women, low self esteem and so on and so forth. These have been problems I’ve struggled with for years but after my move to college I thought it would gradually improve especially now that I’ve started to prioritize living a healthy lifestyle. However it has been 8 weeks and I still have no friends here. I feel awkward eating alone, I don’t go to parties or do much in my free time because I have nobody to do it with. It’s so lonely and I’ve felt lonely for so long. 

My mom texts me at least 10 times a day, and when I recently asked nicely if we could make a goal to text me less, she said “fuck you”, and starts using everything she does for me against me. I’m not too worried about how to erase her influence over my life. When I’m ready, which will be soon, I can lay it all out, it will probably be rough and I’m sure I won’t see my family for a while after that but it’s nothing ive never dealt with before with her.

My main concern is whether or not I can change and live a life I’m happy with. I want to have a social life so bad, I’ve wanted to date for a long time but have never even kissed a girl yet. I’ve been in an out of talk therapy and idk if I’ve just been seeing shitty therapists or what because I never find any solutions or revelations, in fact that only ever happens when I’m on my own and thinking a lot. I’ve been trying to put myself in uncomfortable situations and develop hobbies and healthy habits like meditation, working out, and journaling, but any improvement I see is marginal at best for all the time and energy I spend thinking about improvement. I guess I’m looking for some advice or something, or maybe some confirmation that I can change and live a happy life. And I just kind of needed to get this out there.

If someone would grab them and not let go I know I would end up crying, and when anyone has tried to do it I’ve reacted like I was being tortured and scream, kick, punch and that sort of thing. Do you know when we were kids and everyone was making fun of everyone and pranking them? They never did it to my knees because of how uncomfortable it would make me.

It happens to other parts of my body too, like my big toes. My family says it has been this way forever, since I was a baby.

1697228994.0,Personal Essay,"The Importance of Men’s Mental Health  
The issue of men’s mental health is starting to be recognized more and more but there is still the stigma surrounding it. The stigma of being a man’s man and having to keep inner thoughts to yourself is harmful to each other. The changes experienced in a young man’s life when trying to find out the kind of man they want to be. The issue of loneliness significantly impacts the mental health of young men, making their daily lives and academic pursuits difficult. My essay will try to shed light on the topics and dispel the stigma associated with male vulnerability.   
Men often face challenges and hurdles when it comes to their own mental health. In college the societal expectations and traditional gender roles can create pressure for any man. The need for men to be seen as strong, resilient, and in control of their emotions. With the task that seems so easy of just reaching out for help to men can be seen as a sign of weakness or vulnerability. This can be discoursing men from reaching out for support. Studies suggest that traditional norms of masculinity make it difficult for men to acknowledge their mental health struggles or just being open with their emotions. A study published in 2019 from the Journal of American College Health found male college students often look over the mental health programs and services on their campus due to the stigma surrounding the topic. The fear of societal judgement is keeping young men from the tools to help them. In the same journal article, they talk about how the competitive academic environment and high expectations in college can add to stress and anxiety for male students, leading to a more likelihood of mental health challenge’s during their time in college.  
College can be drastically different then home life, moving from something you are so comfortable with and having it all change. The issue of loneliness is a significant concern for men’s mental health in the context of college. Societal norms of masculinity have an emphasize on independence and self-sufficiency, with that has the outcome of men to hesitate in making social connections and communicate feelings of loneliness. A study published in 2017 by the Journal of Adolescent Research in the relations of traditional masculine norms and the increase of a feeling of loneliness among college aged men. The study yielded that traditional masculine ideals was connected to higher levels of loneliness and decreased willingness to seek out help. Aside from scholastic responsibilities, adjusting to a new social environment and other demands of college life can also make loneliness more common. Developing focused interventions that encourage social interaction, emotional expression, and a sense of community requires a recognition of and a focus on the issue of isolation in men's mental health.  
To promote an environment of open communication, understanding, and support, it is important to lessen the stigma that surrounds men's mental health. The most significant components in fixing this issue are education and awareness efforts. Stereotypes and preconceptions about mental health can be debunked by distributing realistic information about it, including the tools that are accessible and the typical problems that men face. Targeted educational initiatives have demonstrated promise in lowering stigma and raising mental health literacy, in a 2016 study published in the Journal of Mental Health. Additionally, it is beneficial to challenge society conventions and attitudes and encourage open talks about mental health in both official and informal contexts. An article published in the American Journal of Men's Health (2018) highlights the importance that is to mainstream conversations about mental health among men, emphasizing that open talks can encourage getting help and eventually reduce stigma. In the end, we can successfully fight the stigma attached to men's mental health by creating an atmosphere where men feel at ease to discuss their issues and seeking help.  
In this regard, there is no denying that awareness and comprehension of men's mental health have grown, but progress continues to be hindered by persisting stigmas. The general notion of being a ""man's man,"" in addition to the pressure to keep emotional thoughts private, can be detrimental to men's mental health. Young men struggle to navigate societal expectations and define their identities, particularly in the early years of college. Men experience more difficulties because of loneliness, which affects both their everyday life and academic endeavors. It is necessary to address the stigma attached to male vulnerability, and this essay is intended to debunk certain myths about it. College can be an emotionally draining place, and it's important to comprehend how gender norms affect men's mental health. We can strive to remove the stigma associated with men's mental health by encouraging candid conversations, learning, and the development of a supportive and understanding society. It is critical to foster an atmosphere in which men feel at ease talking about their mental health, getting support, and eventually overcoming social norms.

1697254064.0,I feel lonely,"I wanted to preface this with explaining my background for context. I am 20 years old, I really enjoy what I am studying, I have straight A's, good relationships with professors, and have interned at some cool places (at least I think they are cool). I also used to play college sports, I was really good in high school but once I came to the D1 level I burned out and lost my love for the game. I still try to stay fit going on daily runs/lifting when I can. It is safe to say I am a fairly ambitious person, and thankfully in good health so I live a generally good life.  
However, I feel very lonely sometimes. I am grateful to have some good former teammates and guys in my life, but in general I feel like theres only so much you can open up to another guy. I want to be able to talk to someone about the more emotional parts of my life, and some of the inner conflict I face. I also just want to be able to hug someone sometimes, I feel very touch deprived in general.  
I am not the person that really likes going out, I try to force myself to go out to be sociable but it is just not what makes me happy. I am also a bit shy/awkward so I am not really smooth at talking to people at bars or parties.  
A lot of my friends tell me to I should start talking to girls and reaching out to them. I keep telling myself I should but I am slightly introverted and need time to recharge my social battery (especially with my busy schedule and the field I am in requiring me to constantly interact with people). I just chalk off not actively chasing as being ""busy"" and keep procrastinating doing it. Part of it, is that it feels unnatural to me.

1697232357.0,I feel hopeless in life right now and I feel like I need to talk about it,"I'm sorry if this isn't the correct subreddit for something like this. I will also warn you that this will be very long, I have years of pent-up feelings and emotions that I have never been able to talk about and I'm gonna try to see if I can let it out through Reddit. I will also warn you that this is gonna be a pity party, and I'll try not to sulk as much as possible but it's inevitable that I do in a post like this.

Let's start with why I have to do this in a Reddit post. I have no friends (see, pity party). I haven't had friends since high school (I'm a sophomore in college). And even then they weren't really friends- I had people I talked to in school but I never has anybody that I would do things with outside of school. Fast forward to today and I don't even have people I talk to on campus. I'm a transfer student so I'm new to this campus but it's been a couple months now and most people would have at least made some sort of a friend. People always say that college is where you meet so many amazing people but I just haven't. I don't know how to talk to people and when I do it's always awkward. Sure, I'll occasionally answer a question from a dude in my Python class (I'm a computer science major, really shocking right?) and I'll work on group projects obviously but I don't have friends. I don't know how to make friends. I am incredibly lonely. And yeah, the fact that I'm unloading all this in a Reddit post of all places probably made that obvious. But it really is bad. I'm 19, only ever had a couple of real friends in my life that all drifted apart. It's incredibly pathetic and I hate myself for it. I don't think I'm that unlikable. I mean I know I'm weird but I really don't think I'm that weird. I just want to have SOMEONE I can do things with but I don't know how to do that. My days are the same everyday. I wake up, drive to campus (I live at home with my family, which I know isn't doing me any favors in the making friends department), go to class, go home, do homework, play video games, go to sleep. Rinse and repeat. Every single day. I'm just so lonely. 

I absolutely hate my body and everything about me. I know that's not an uncommon opinion and I'm not exactly revolutionizing the idea of mental health problems by saying I hate the way I look, but it's cliché for a reason. Everything about me sucks. I'm ugly, overweight, I have insane gynecomastia that I can't afford to remove that has killed my confidence since I was 13, I have a pathetically small *you know*, and I'll probably be bald by the time I'm 25. I am everything that women find undesirable all combined into one man. I'm just so depressed from it. I've tried dozens of times to lose weight to at least *try* and improve myself, but I fail nearly everytime. I just have an intense appetite that I can't ever seem to satisfy and I means I just eat like crazy. It also makes deficits really hard to stick to. My most successful weight loss experience was losing 40 pounds actually (I went from 220 lbs to 180 lbs) but I gained nearly all of it back so I'm back to square one. I know it's not supposed to be easy but I wish I was strong enough to do it.

I also don't mean to sound like I'm resentful towards women. Believe me, I'm not. I promise you I'm not an incel. I'm not mad at women for any of my problems (and maybe I didn't come off that way and I'm just rambling but anyway). I just really want a girlfriend. Falling in love and starting a family is practically my only goal in life but that's not gonna happen if I can't get my act together and fix myself. Granted, a lot of the things wrong with me aren't really fixable but I can at least try to make up in other areas. I just wish I was better, you know? I wish I was good enough to get a girlfriend but I'm just not and I probably never will be. I can't seem to have the discipline to lose weight. And my gynecomastia will probably never get removed because I need to lose weight to deal with it. And there's nothing I can do to fix my *you know what* so I'll always have to compensate in that regard but i just hoped that I could make up for my shortcomings. I just don't feel like a man. I'm pathetic. I'm a man with an embarrassingly high-pitched voice, literal boobs, and a below average manhood. I'm not a man and I never will be. I just hate the idea that any girl I'm lucky enough to get close to would have to compensate with a bunch of things wrong with me. It sucks too because I feel like I would be a good boyfriend? (This is where the incel energy comes in lol). Like I said earlier, I don't think I'm a bad person. I wanna fall in love and give my girlfriend the world and I would do anything for her. But that's obviously not true because I can't even lose weight for the idea of a girlfriend haha. It's just that overall, I'm so incredibly below average and instead making an attempt to improve myself I just sit around and sulk.

My family situation also just makes me scared. My mom has early-onset alzheimer's and it's getting worse by the day. I think I'm still in denial about a lot of it (even though she's been diagnosed for over a year). My dad is an alcoholic. Granted he's not as bad as he once was but he still indulges on the weekends sometimes. And with him having to constantly grapple with my mom's condition it's like I can truly blame him. I'm just so scared for the future. Both my parents have chronic diseases and I have no one to talk about it with. I just have to navigate through this by myself and it's so exhausting.

Now that I get to this point in the post I'm realizing that a lot of the smaller stuff I was gonna talk about that would have made the post incredibly long are probably not worth writing here. I've written enough already and it kinda felt good to just write the main stuff out. I've never really expressed this stuff before. If you read this whole thing, thank you, truly.

1697239524.0,Loneliness is hitting hard..,So I've dealt with anxiety for years now but I haven't had it hit this hard to the point of every day being a struggle since I was 18 back in 2017 but ever since last week I've been suffering with such a terrible loneliness feeling that has brought me a great deal of anxiety on top of it.. and It seems it's ever since this American girl I'm close with told me about the places she's been in America and how nice it all was and it really kinda hurt me for some reason that I couldn't be there with her  and go to all these nice places with her and its really made me hate being stuck in the UK with only one real friend and nobody to love and idk I think I might have accidently fallen for this American girl cause I always feel sad when she's not around and desperately feel like I want her with me.. and we talk all the time and have been affectionate with each other even though we're not officially together.. but I think I made a mistake in doing that because it's recently become something I'm getting anxious and feeling awful about because I want her with me so badly and I want to go to these places so badly but I just have so much I need to work out in therapy still including a fear of planes because I fear feeling trapped.. it all just sucks and every day feels hard and I don't want to do anything cause I feel so sick with anxiety and I just don't get why this feeling has come back so intensely out of nowhere..  i have somewhat recently started some new medication (I'm about 2 weeks into it) but Is it possible that would make me feel worse this far in? Idk.. its Citalopram 10mg so its not even a big dose and I was gonna get a higher dose because I felt it wasn't doing much for me but idk.. I'm just hating everything right now and really struggling.. I've already been feelin scared about what I'm gonna do with my life cause I just have some lame part time convenience store job and now I'm having to struggle with intense loneliness and anxiety on top of that.. sorry for this not well written rant I just needed to kinda vent even if nobody cares..,mentalhealth
1697238824.0,Wondering if anyone can relate to this?,"Question: does anyone else start cleaning and then find it hard to stop once you get a rhythm going? 😄

I came home from my PHP (Partial Hospitalization Program) today after spending 6 hours basically doing...not much at all (we had Art Therapy which means I got MESSY with paints like a toddler and it was a BLAST!!!!) and I realized my sons' room was a holy MESS! The 3 boys (21, 19, and 13) share a large open room and are complete slobs...as teenage boys tend to be. 😂 So, I started by cleaning out by the radiator and finally fixing the wooden top that had fallen inside the cabinet (it just sits on top), getting all the garbage and clothes out from behind it. 

TW:insects mentioned

>! The roaches were all hiding inside the radiator where it is warm, so I had my Raid ready and blasted those little buggers to he** where they belong. !<

I moved the mattresses, boxsprings and got all the garbage out. I don't have a vacuum at the moment (one has been ordered and we will get it VERY soon tho!) but I did broom sweep the carpet, which wasn't all that difficult. I then noticed the mess behind the boys' dresser (and more of the above in the spoiler) so I cleaned that all out too! I swear, I went to shower and when I came back out to the living room afterwards, it was like being in a new apartment!!! It looks fantastic and I'm so proud of my two boys who helped me so much! My daughter (16) and other son (19) are at work, so it's just the 3 of us here. I ordered Subway and now I'm relaxing ... Finally. I'm exhausted but overjoyed at how the apartment looks. My eldest (24) is coming home to visit (he lives in Rochester NY) and I can't wait to finish the little nook room we have and allow him to come home to a CLEAN apartment for once. My Depression has been so bad lately but I kicked it's butt today and got stuff done! I just wanted to share something positive that happened!

1697236725.0,Is it ok to take a mental break?,"Hi new member!
I’m sure just from reading other posts everything that is happening has become overwhelming from a mental health perspective. 
Maybe it’s a rhetorical question maybe it’s not. But is it ok to just “separate” yourself from the news to think of other things that make you happy? 
I’m a Jewish American. I’m like so many others horrified by this week. But the guilt and the…uselessness feeling I guess? over not being able to do anything and feeling safe so far away from everything and watching the events unfold has started to really strain my already strained mental health. 
Am I ok to feel ok about just turning it all off and focusing on fun aspects of my life (in my instance researching and betting (albeit very small) on football). Every time I read an article on football strategy d I keep having this nagging feeling that I’m not supposed to enjoy “trivial” things like sports at this time and I’m supposed to just feel guilty and upset about Israel (not to mention Ukraine etc etc). I keep putting myself in the place of an israeli right now and feeling horrible for being an American, not because of any political or whatever, but because I’m at least in theory very safe and far away. 
Do others feel this way? How do others cope with these feelings? 
Thanks all for listening!",mentalhealth
1697249927.0,Something That Helped Me,"Hello. So I just wanna preface this by saying this isn't for everyone, and that I kinda stumbled upon this by accident. I was doing research for a book I'm writing and I got into this hobby that just changed things for me. And yeah it's just a hobby but this hobby like, immediately improved my mental health in the day-to-day. I was already on a healing journey and made progress, I feel like this just kinda sped me over the last bits I needed.

I hope this works for you too.

But the hobby is called Speculative Evolution. Basically it's the hobby of creating a conceptual alien planet with atmosphere, host star(s), moons. Maybe even other planetary bodies. And then you research these environmental conditions and how they may result in the emergence of life on that planet, and how that life may evolve over the planet's natural history.

It sounds weird but it's a lot of fun, because it's deep knowledge, it's creative, scientific, mathematic, but the sheer implications of everything in it just helped me feel good in a very existential way.

As I was going through my specevo project I kept learning about how life formed on earth, and the pressures and issues faced by life in order to evolve, and just the genius learning and adaptability of our genes. It was like magic to me and I couldn't believe it. I told my fiancè my main take away was because life itself isn't conscious, then that means the wild forces of nature form their own equilibrium. And the things in nature change in order to force this equilibrium. If over billions of years, somehow I have managed to be here and exist, then that to me means that I am, in some way, essential to life.

And the thing about that is, if I am, everyone is. The potential of our existence was locked in the cosmic particles of stars that exploded to make our world. And through billions of years of climactic chaos, primordial change, genetic mutation/adaptation, plagues, mass exitinction - somehow life determined that I - *we* - were essential to the advancement of *life.*

It just made me happy. I felt, feel, *so* incredibly connected to the world and I feel like my place in it, though small and tiny, is not insignificant. I feel good about the world, and I have a renewed appreciation for the flora and fauna of the world. It's also reconnected me to my art as I draw and paint the creatures and plants I make. It's fun and it's gifted me this incredible stance on existence. Of course I still have bad days but since getting involved in speculative evolution, life has just been better.

If anyone wants to give it a go, here's some links to the resources I use(d).

1697228186.0,"My friend was put on Keppra and her behavior has since become increasingly worrisome. How does she get help today? Please read below, TIA","My friend (28f) was put on Keppra at the end of June after having her third seizure in a year. Since then, she claims to have been feeling aggressive and within the past week her words/thought process are really worrying me. She is displaying symptoms of psychosis. She has a history of substance abuse, mania, and psychosis. She’s been to rehab and inpatient multiple times, but has been sober from alcohol and doing very well for the past ~8 months. I did not see this coming. 

When she had her last seizure, her doc had just cut her off her Valium script cold turkey. She was also on adderall (not prescribed). Since then she saw a new doctor, who specializes in addiction, and he has been tapering her off valium and put her on Keppra for seizures. She smokes weed and is sober from alcohol. 

Like stated in the title, she has been saying far-out things this past week and showing signs of psychosis. 

She went to her “addiction doctor,” earlier this week, and he told her to wait until she sees her neurologist (in a few months,) to get off the Keppra bc she might have epilepsy.

Today, my friend went to the hospital looking for help because she can not think straight. I’m texting her now and she said, ‘they said they can’t help me,’ and to see a neurologist. I know that checking into inpatient is an option, and she is open to it. She packed a bag in case they want her to stay. 

But, I guess they haven’t told her to check in. What should she do? How can she get help today about her medications and symptoms? 

Is inpatient the only option?

Two years ago i was 170cm 96 kg, and i decided that it was over. I kicked bad food out of my life and in a year lost approximately 10 kg, but everything went really fast from this year. 

I have quit alcohol and processed food and had a calorie deficit everyday for 6 months. Ngl i really hyperfocused on my weight and was weighing me every morning until, in 6 months, i made it to my goal : 69 kg.

The problem is that i’m still absolutely complexed by my body, can’t take off my shirt in public and even skipped every summer beach trip with my relatives to avoid having to get myself topless. 
i still feel like i am an obese ugly man when i talk to a pretty woman and am really lacking self confidence. 
i still see my face too fat and my body too and its to the point where its the only thing i watch when i facetime someone. 

Yesterday my doc weighed me, fully clothed with my plateform shoes: barely 60kg

I don’t even know what answer i’m looking for i’m just getting concerned because i’m obviously not seeing my real self in the mirror.

1697239516.0,I Don't Want to Study,"I feel so stupid typing this but, i started uni about a month and a half ago. I have depression and social anxiety, so i did a lot of planning before the semester so things would go smoothly. I have a college diploma, but it was close enough to commute, but now that i'm getting a degree, i live about a 2 hour drive away from home. First time away from my family for more than a week.

Everything started out okay, but then towards the end of the second week, i found out i didn't register for all the courses i was supposed to take. 4 courses became 6, and 4 of those six are physics chem, bio, and calc. needless to say i've been kind of lagging for at least 1 course because i end up having to shift proprities to catch up. Especially with calc since all my functions knowledge was not put to use during my 2 years in college.

MIdterms start next week, and i'm freaking out. Right now i'm trying to study, but as soon as i cover a concept, i just want to do anything not related to academics. I've been crying more than usual, and can only work in short bursts. Like i can spend a whole day in the library just studying, but my brain will not let me do as much the next day.

1697224649.0,"On a self-mastery journey to perfecting myself, but I feel like I’m starting to lose my mind.","I’ve been going through a journey of self-mastery for quite a while now. In 2021, I had a strange occurrence where the day following a party, my vision on one eye blurred out and I got in a state of unexplainable confusion, where my thoughts were hard to think about and I generally couldn’t form thoughts properly except from what’s going on. Since that day, I’m not sure if something changed with my brain neurologically, or psychogenically, I started noticing negative changes to how I think and perceive reality. 

I started noticing that particularly socially, my conversations started to get more bland and I found myself lost for responses and ideas. This increasingly grew, and the brain fog started getting really bad. Soon, this brain fog was the only thing on my mind throughout the day, and every small stimulus could bring me back to the thought loops that something is wrong with my body. Thoughts just didn’t want to stem out and connect with other neurones (eg. If I look at a tree, I’d just think tree, and it was an effort to make the mental connections)

For almost 2 years I was convinced that this was some sort of brain abnormality, and it caused my subconscious to grow this monster of negativity and anxiety, constantly thinking that it can’t think. However, a few months back I started to find answers to my questions and clarity on my situation via the wisdoms of self-mastery, which included being aware of my subconscious activity and understanding why it works the way it did. Prior to this, I only really felt like myself a few times a year; clear-headed and articulate, confident and happy. After learning about myself and finding wisdom about how the mind works, it felt like a breakthrough and transcendence. With the amount of valuable information I’ve learnt on how to live life happily, I was seeing myself be in my best forms multiple times a week. 

To make it clearer, I think of it in a way like this. My negative (default) state, is how I usually am - foggy thoughts, bottlenecked personality, low memory and recall etc. Then I have my positive state, where I feel like the a decent amount of the wisdom I need to incorporate into my life to make it good is available. Then I have my perfect state, where it genuinely feels like all the wisdom is available to me, starts to make sense on chasmic levels beyond basic words, and all of it feels like the final puzzle piece was put it. During it I feel euphoric and unstoppable, and I realise that anything in this world is possible and I can be and do whatever I like in the perfect way. I feel so intelligent and positive and all my doubts and questions feel insignificant, and I know that if I make this way of thinking permanent I will live the best life I could imagine. I feel safe being mindful and thus my head is filled with perfect ideas and principles of life, and it feels like I’m in full control over my thoughts and reality.

However, these states keep fluctuating. Maintaining these positive and perfect states is difficult, because I find myself forgetting the wisdom I need to incorporate and it turn it reminds me that I’m not that perfect envisionment of myself. I’ve learnt that I’m a toxic perfectionist, and while I understand that true perfection isn’t possible, my ideology of perfection is achievable. My goal is to reach this state at least 90% of my days, only feeling negativity when it’s truly justifiable and valid. My purpose in life is to impact people in positive ways, be that by making them smile, laugh, motivate or help, as it works symbiotically with my happiness. When I feel like people see me as a positive impact, it brings a positive impact to me too.

Now, since the last few days I’ve been trying to microdose shrooms to assist me in this. I’m not sure whether this is caused by this fact, but the last few days my thoughts and negative states have been worse than ever. It feels like my mind is so quiet, but my subconscious is filled with negativity, and the fact that I can’t think genuinely leaves me feeling numb and empty. It feels like my subconscious is gaining full control over me and I can just watch it through a glass wall. I really can’t explain it but I feel so out of it, and thinking feels like I’m just reading words out a book instead of formulating them. I can’t focus on anything and can’t stay mindful, as I’m soon reminded that I’m not thinking the way I want to be when I’m in my positive states. I forget the wisdoms or they stop having meaning, and it’s like I forget who I even want to be or what this perfect person is. Reading back my wisdom bank doesn’t help, as my brain needs extensive algorithm style evidence to prove it wrong and that I’m fine and already this perfect person deep down. I don’t think the fact that knowing that this perfect state of me is possible, as it makes me crave it more when I can’t even remember what it is. It’s really started to drive me mad and I’m hoping that this isn’t me losing my mind. What can I do to help me ground myself?",mentalhealth

1697223800.0,Help me understand,"I am in a bit of a mental pickle and it's not something recent. 

I don't know where to start but in short I struggle to keep my mental health stable. Sometimes I feel manically amazing and start doing stuff I would never normally do like wasting money or other really impulsive actions. Then suddenly I will lose whatever I felt. I'll go from feeling near superior to everyone else to feeling like I'm at the bottom of the food chain.

I've tried loving - and that's what I struggle the most with. It's not like I'm not sexually or mentally attracted because the times I have been in a relationship I've been very active. But then suddenly out of literally nowhere it feels as if I can't love anymore. It's not a feeling of losing emotions for someone but rather a feeling that I can't love.
In the two first relationships I ignored this as the the love feelings would come back after some days or hours. In the third relationship I broke down crying to my s/o because I felt the love loss feeling again and I started apologising to her as I explained the entire thing.

I hate this. I want a future with children and a loving family but I can't seem to be able to love properly as I don't want to hurt anyone.

It's not just love being affected but also friendships. I feel I can enjoy a person for so and so long and then suddenly something changes inside of me and I feel I don't want to talk to them. But then I am suddenly okay with them again - and as you can figure this has ruined a lot of friendships.

I have sort of neglected this for years, but did actually seek help when I was younger. My psychiatrist shrugged it off as hormones but now I'm older and I only feel it getting worse.

It might be worth noting my mother is disgnosed bipolar - which might be inherited.

After half a dozen sessions over a few months I feel like I talk in circles, and the few therapists I've seen try to deflect my concerns. They diminish my concerns. They assume I'm being dramatic. After explaining my situation for a few sessions only then do they concede that I'm not making this up, and by this point I've lost interest in talking to them. My most recent therapist actually said something along the lines of, ""Oh, that sounds serious. I was assuming this was going to be a non-issue, but I see this is a real problem."" This is the second therapist who's told me something like this. At that point I'm like, ""Why am I even here? If you don't believe me, why am I even here?""

I've only tried one type of depression med, but cost is scary for me. The one I tried made things way worse. I spoke to the doctor, and he said he was going to prescribe me something new. I picked up the new script and it was the exact same thing as before. It kinda turned me off the whole thing, but honestly I think it will help me.

1697222890.0,Ended long term relationship now struggling with purpose,"32/M I just got out of a long term relationship. We were together for 3 years and lived together for over a year. I wouldn't say it was a ""toxic"" relationship but it was not good for my mental health. I would street more about going home than I did going to work. I stayed with her because my luck with finding women is very low and my rationale was it's this or nothing so this is better than nothing. 

I got promoted to a new department at work and there is this woman who was super attractive and very fun to be around. I've been cheated on so I would never do anything like that. So I practically blew off the woman at work I may poke fun and do ""light flirting"" but nothing crazy. Well she was the catalyst that convinced me that I'm not stuck there is a chance for me to find someone else. So I ended my relationship with my girlfriend and asked her on a lunch date. She denied me because her mom was out of town for her birthday and she was going to celebrate now that she's home. I just played it cool and said we'll maybe next time.

The next week I was going to play things by ear to see if maybe I was picking up her just being friendly as flirting. Well she came back even stronger with flirting. If I was resting my foot on my knee she would slap it off, my other co worker hid her drink and chips and she went to me and started choking me, so I tickled her and she smiled at me. So I'm thinking hell yeah things are good. 

It's now Thursday (the last day of our work week) and there is a happy hour, I talk to her and let her know I'm going (in hopes she goes too). When I show up everyone is talking about relationships (every single person is friends with her which I didn't know yet) one dude keeps talking about how good his lunch date was that he went on... Well it was with her. And they went at the same time I asked her to go out and have lunch. So her name is every 3rd word out of his mouth and I play it cool and stay for a while. Apparently, she was going to show up to the happy hour but ""had something come up"" so she didn't go. 

I get home and text her and basically tell her that I knew they went on a date and he seemed head over heels about her, and I just got out of a long term relationship and not looking for a serious relationship right now. If she's wanting something serious that we should stop flirting but if she isn't looking to dive deep into a relationship that we can go get Friday the 13th tattoos tomorrow. We'll she left me on read so I'm assuming that our tattoo date is off... No biggie

He prefers big tits, big butt. He's called my breasts ""grapes"" and my butt ""egg"". To be fair, I wasn't working out when he first met me, but I've been consistent and in even better shape than ever before and I'm 6 months postpartum. I workout 45-60 min at least five days a week, eat well and not out of boredom. I know it will take time to grow muscles, and I'm trying to advance in weights lifted etc, so maybe it's a time thing, but he always said when he was younger he went for a guy's ideal. And then when he met me he tried caring more about personality, which, is a huge slap in the face to hear. As far as I know, every girl wants to be a guy's ideal, or maybe that's just me. He said their personalities weren't great, and he was just being vain.

He said he can ""like cookies but not have them in the house"" as a metaphor about it, but it's a huge deal to me to be my guy's type. I wouldn't have even entertained this relationship had I known that, but we're deep in it now. Build wise I'd say I'm like average to athletic.

We do plan on having more kids and we're not super well off financially so I can't just go get a b\*\*b job which is the only way to fix that issue. And all I can do with the other is just keep working out hard, which I do at home but he keeps saying I should do at the gym, but with what time? I take care of our baby, clean, cook, work, etc but still make time for workouts that are very intense.

Idk, this is kind of a rant but this is making me incredibly depressed. Of course I want to be the ideal, but I'm afraid I never will be, or worse, that I'm just lazy and am not putting in the work. So like I said I'm trying to push myself even harder with workouts and do more leg focused and glute focused with heavier weights, but in the meantime I feel like crap.

Self love is so difficult for me. I dyed my hair red which was the most selfish thing physical look wise I've done since I was previously blonde and I know he prefers them. On top of this, he doesn't think I'm good intimately. SOOOOOOO, I'm feeling low.

I'm fucking scared that I'll never be able to feel happiness sober again. I haven't even tried substances yet, so I'm also scared they can't fix me. At this point I'd do anything.

Sometimes I do self destructive behaviors just so I may even worse; it's honestly better than the hollowness. Sometimes I stop eating/restrict a lot, then I binge eat, sometimes I cut myself.

I'll do everyone a favour, and tell my (sob) story succinctly.

I went to pilates classes
I ate healthily and well

There are multiple reasons why my stress has got this bad, I won’t get into them. But it’s been a downward spiral since January. 

I’m a very vocal person. I don’t hide away my pain or mask it. Every issue I’ve had I’ve shared it with my fiancé, I’ve screamed and cried. I’ve cried about my period being late for weeks. I’ve showed him the broken skin on my fingertips. He knows I’m not showering. He sees the unpaid parking fine letters keep coming that I’m not paying so the fine keeps increasing
He sees the thousands I spend on clothes then don’t return and every week I say I need to return them but I can’t do it

He knows my problems. He sees it all. 

He gives surface level comfort but he doesn’t do anything 

It’s not his job but why doesn’t he DO anything

I’ve been breaking down about it. How is he asking this? He must know? 
After those 5 minutes he went ahead and decided to make himself a plate of leftovers whilst still asking me what’s wrong.  

I’m on the floor, shaking, mute. And he’s fixing himself a plate of food?

I then go upstairs and he follows me. This time he’s getting a bit bothered. He kept asking me what’s wrong. He kept saying the same thing. He kept probing. I was frozen I couldn’t say anything. I gestured to him that I couldn’t speak. He understood then proceeded to keep asking me what was wrong. Then he said “it makes me feel helpless when you’re like this”

1697218368.0,Struggling with Indecision and Apathy,"I've been wondering whether to post this or not; I don't even know if this is a real problem. But for the past few years, I've been living in a state of constant uncertainty, and I need some insights or advice..

It's like I'm living in a perpetual state of 50/50, where I no longer feel strongly about anything.Whether it's a significant life decision or even the simplest daily choices like what to eat, I often find myself stuck in a perpetual state of indecision, as if I'm perpetually balanced on the fence,  and it's even causing me to lose touch with my own values and principles.

For eg- On my birthday, everyone was eager to go out to eat, and I was simply going along with the plan. However, when one member of the group couldn't make it due to illness, the thought of canceling the entire party crossed my mind, and surprisingly, I felt quite content with that idea, equally okay with celebrating or not.

 I've been a vegetarian by birth, but now I feel absolutely nothing when it comes to the idea of eating meat. It's like, ""Eh, it's okay if I try it, and it's also okay if I don't."" This indecision extends to my college classes as well. I attend most of them, but some days I just feel unmotivated or lazy, and I don't even feel guilty about missing them.What's deeply concerning is that it got to a point where I had studied diligently for a midterm exam, but on the day of the test, I just couldn't find the motivation to take it. I was fine with both taking the exam and not taking it. My family was planning a vacation to my favorite resort, and I found myself completely indifferent about whether we should go or not.This might sound stupid, but sometimes I see a homeless person, and part of me wishes I could be in their shoes. Failing out of my engineering degree or living as a homeless person doesn't seem to bother me much.

This constant 50/50 feeling has drained the joy out of everything, and I don't want to keep living like this. I'm 21, and I wish I could feel more strongly about things. Have any of you experienced something similar or have advice to share? I'd really appreciate your insights.",mentalhealth

I need therapy. I can’t afford therapy. Wife’s insurance won’t cover therapy, my job doesn’t cover it. I grew up being beat, manipulated, relatives trying to sleep with me, dealt with addiction, got chastised by parents for having suicidal thoughts (in my teen years), almost have gone through divorce, lost our house, lost my grandparents who were my saving grace in 2018, lost both of my parents this year- mom took her life and blamed me but thanked those most toxic to her, I feel ill never get closure with my parents and our horrific relationships, I keep ruining shit in my marriage, my adhd is taking over full swing and I no longer have the mental fortitude to fight it, my depression has taken over to the point where I’m just here. I don’t care about anything anymore. I’m going through the motions of life, causing irreversible rifts in my marriage. I think that’s over. I’m burnt out with work, I’m burnt out with school. I’m burnt out. I don’t have friends, don’t have time to do anything, nor money. I sleep 6.5-7 hours a day but am constantly so exhausted I fall asleep standing up. I can’t keep going like this. I don’t want to. It’s not fair to me, my kid or my wife. I’m at a total loss of what to do. I once again royally fucked up with my lack of communication, wringing out the last droplets of trust my wife had in me so she isn’t talking to me. My baby needs me so I know I can’t go anywhere. I feel so trapped in life. I don’t want a divorce, I don’t want the anxiety, I don’t want the depression, I don’t want the dissociation, I don’t want myself. I want a reset. I want out of this mess if I could only keep my kid.

Life is too messy. It shouldn’t be this difficult. I’m sober- 7 years. I have a career I’ve been in for a decade, I’m in college. Shouldn’t things be looking up? I’m not even 30 yet and I’ll never own a house, probably never get out of debt, probably be a single dad working jobs he hates to stay afloat in life and still provide a happy childhood for my flesh and blood.

1697230319.0,I am lonely and I miss my family!,"This just me complaining about missing my family, I am happy about any supporting words.

I moved out of my family home (mother, father, two siblings and three cats) a year and a month ago now, to go study, about four hours away by car, 6 by train or bus, to go study in a different country, as I also want to build a life there, because ours is not that well off. I am the eldest daughter. I really love my studies and everything I do here, I am also moving in with my lovely boyfriend soon, so I am really doing well. Sure, I have a LOT to do, I work and study full-time, but it is working. However, I just really, really, really miss my family.

I used to live in a pretty big, but due to the weird layout still cramped apartment with my family, and I really liked it. It was never really quiet and there is always someone to talk to and spend time with. I loved being given tasks like doing the laundry, cleaning the kitty litter or the kitchen, taking out the trash...I loved watching movies and shopping for groceries with my mom (who is more like my best friend), cooking family meals and discussing pop culture with my dad. Not to mention spending time with my annoying, but lovely siblings, who would play stupid songs on the guitar with me and play videogames as a team. I would always buy or make them lunch and hug them every day after school, help with homework, etc. And the cats would follow everywhere I sat, to cuddle or get their daily 14:00 snacks.  I went from a bustling household, to living pretty much alone. 

Nothing quite feels the same and I miss them all greatly. I understand this is a sacrifice I have to make for my studies, but I am so sad. Genuinely so so sad. I call with my mom and dad every few days and I always call first, but my siblings don´t really bother. They are unreachable. The worst thing is the realization that I will probably never live with them again, unless everything goes to shit here and I lose my job.  I have friends here, I have lovely people around me and still I miss my family so intensely. I just want to go home, but now when I go it feels like their lives have gotten easier without me. No, they are not financially supporting me in any way at all. I just miss my family and I wanna go back to the way things were. And I am sad because I know that will never happen again...

Even though I’m aware at the back of my mind it is. I sometimes get the urge to make a loud noise, do something to grab their attention, because I feel what I’m experiencing is fake.

It is about my husband who is diagnosed with schizophrenia (I wrote about him in this subreddit 3 weeks ago). He has been in the hospital for a month right now. His current delusion was getting worse, but somehow it overlaps with the things he wants to do when he's normal.  
  
I heard the latest from his mom that he said he wanted to start a new life. Quit drinking, smoking weed, cigarette, everything. Hence he asked to be placed into a rehabilitation clinic. This is something I have heard from him before his relapse. On our holiday he told me that he wanted to quit weed and he wanted to seek help when he's back. When he still talked to me in the hospital, he also said he wanted to quit cigarettes but he knew he couldn't do that when he's in the hospital. For context, we live in the Netherlands. He wanted to make everything new, but he said he doesn’t want to go back home. He said that him and me are already over. He also said to his mom about the marriage, “I don’t promise I’ll be in it forever” or something like that. It really hurts me. So it feels like his reality is somehow twisted, or that his brain still cannot comprehend that in his “old life” he also has some good things like a wife and getting married. It’s like he generalises everything in his old life as “bad” and he wants to throw them all away.  
  
I feel so hurt and heartbroken. I know this is his psychosis or delusion talking but still I feel so sad that he can say those words to me. He's everything for me.

The doctor was very young (92) and asked me a few questions first about my family and then about me, eventually prescribing me sertraline.
Reading on the internet I had read that in the first psychiatric visit they usually ask you to do a questionnaire, which however was not done to me... also because I suspect I also have ADHD

1697206464.0,I did so well today - controlling my tears in public,"Ok so I don’t advocate in the slightest bottling up emotions. However sometimes crying in public can make us feel worse in the long run. 

So last year I was in active trauma at my work. I would get to the point where I would start crying and when I start crying I can’t really stop. Whether that’s because I’m neurodivergent, have complex trauma, or both, who knows.

Today I went into a training group for a new job. I asked a question in front of everyone and the man answered, very passionately, quite forcefully about why we don’t do what my question was about. I don’t know if it was because I struggled to read him, felt triggered because of trauma from many authority figures in my life, feelings of humiliation or all of these together but I felt my eyes sting and start to tear up. I didn’t initially want to leave obviously because the training hadn’t finished yet, so i focused on my breathing. But it wasn’t helping and at this point I couldn’t focus on the training so I excused myself to go to the toilet. Took 5 minutes in the toilet, let myself tear to an extent while I just continued focusing on my breathing and telling myself I’d been triggered unintentionally, felt embarrassed and told myself I was going to be ok. I knew my face would go red as soon as I was tearful because I get rosacea and eczema so I was scared about going back into the room. I put cold water on my face and it didn’t make much difference but I managed to stop the tears and walk back in with a smile on my face. I apologised, explained I was hot and felt my rosacea flaring up, and had to go put cold water on my face. Not a total lie but just lied about the reason my rosacea was flaring up. They were cool with it and I managed to complete the training. 

Of course I cried more on the way home, but I told myself my adrenaline will be going for about 90mins and something about understanding the physical aspect of being triggered emotionally helped me from going into a spiralling.

As I said I don’t advocate bottling up emotions. However I’m sure most people can appreciate that crying in certain places just attracts attention which makes us feel worse in the long run. I do feel I was able to do this because I’m not in an abusive situation anymore whereas last year I just couldn’t stop crying when I started whatsoever. 

Obviously if you are at your wits end and can’t take it anymore, just cry where ever and please get help from someone. Im just now in a better place so feel more able to do it now than last year. 

So yeah I feel I’ve managed to win a recovery challenge so to speak. I guess we can’t really recover if we don’t get a chance to practise recovery. It’s almost 90mins up after the trigger now at time of posting this and I can feel the adrenaline has almost gone. Yay!",mentalhealth
1697189400.0,I don't feel love for friends: is this mental illness/trauma?,"I am unable to feel love for friends: is this normal?
I am able to love, but I am only able to love romantic partners. The sheer force of the love I am capable of having for a partner is immeasurable, it's something that consumes my entire being, it's like a constant high (not talking about honeymoon phase, but the love itself). They are... everything. But friends? I feel nothing.

I was always like this. I had 0 interest in friends growing up, I longed for romantic love before I even had even lost all my baby teeth. I would avoid people and sit by myself in school. My teacher wanted to send me to therapy but my father refused. I just... did not want them.

Now, I do want to say, I was isolated from kids until age 8, no siblings, and that I faced heavy bullying, so that probably skewed things, but even with that, there is simply no innate desire in me for friendships.

I have ""friends"", and it's not a matter of finding the right person at all for me. I have ""friends"" who consider me one of or their most closest friend. I know every inch of them as people. I have known one for 7 years and by all accounts we are ""best friends"" and close. But I don't feel anything for her? If I could get a free burger by throwing her under the bus, I genuinely would. The only reason why I have ""friends"" is because I see the benefit. I see someone who will do things for you and give you free stuff and possibly be good for job opportunities. But I don't feel anything for them. I cried with them, they cried with me yet even then my heart is stone cold and my emotions were because of social protocol and because it feels like I am a main protagonist in a movie. I have had periods where I force myself to maintain these relationships (tired me out, 0 emotional benefit, only because I stand to gain material things) and periods where I just ignore everyone until, frankly, I have a use for them.",mentalhealth
1697227187.0,What's wrong with me,"This isn't part of my question, but I think it's useful context. A few years ago I started to faint fairly regularly after taxing my body too hard, but I was told that thus was pretty normal for teenagers and after a few tests it was determined that nothing is wrong with my body. 
I also always got a really weird uncomfortable  feeling when watching films where people take drugs, I noticed how I felt the need to scratch my arms and I got weaker in my hands when watching scenes with drugs, but I have never taken any drugs (except alkohol). 

Now to the important part. One and a half years ago a police officer came to our school to give a presentation about smth, I don't 100% remember, but there was a part in his presentation where he talked about drugs and described their effects. While he was describing them I felt the effects he was describing a bit and then slowly felt tingling in my arms and got tunnel vision. Before I could talk to anyone I fainted. This was while sitting down and not after any physical activity. 

Since then I haven't fainted anymore, but about half a year ago when watching a youtube video about someone who had a bullet in his brain and you could clearly see, that he was in great pain, I got the same feeling when watching drug scenes, my arms began tingling, I had to scratch my arms, I got tunnel vision and on top of that I started hyperventilating. I stopped watching the video and got in my bed and tried to calm down, but it only got worse. I started shaking and loosing control of my body. I only lost complete control over the top half of my body, and I could still move my arms a bit, but my hands were completely locked and I was shaking on my whole body. In the end the only way I could alert my parents was by breathing so loud that they heard me. It got a bit better once they came, but they still had to call the ambulance to check up on me. The doctors still said that nothing was wrong with my body. 

Since then I get these kind of panic attacks? pretty regularly, about once or twice a month. They never got as strong as the first time, but they got pretty close. I have to fear that it might happen every time I watch something related to drugs or pain or smth that reminds me of it, it happened even once when I was just listening to music that reminded me of it. 

Does anyone know what is wrong with me? I have an appointment with a psychiatrist, but it will take another half year till that.",mentalhealth
1697199692.0,Am I mentally healthy enough?,"TW: mentions of suicidal thoughts 

Hi guys, I (f,22) have been struggling with mental health since I was 12. I started seeing a psychiatrist and gotten meds when I was 15. Since then i’ve been on different medication and now I see my psychiatrist every three months for a check up. 
I’ve also had therapy before but have been without it for 3 years now.
 
Lately a lot of my friends have been stressing out about their futures - getting more education, getting full time employment, love life and such whereas I don’t worry about the future at all. They praise me and tell me they love how chill and nonchalant I am about it all but the truth is: I don’t worry about my future because I always see suicide as a second option.

I would say I’m ‘passive suicidal’ (thinking of dying, suicide, just not actively planning it) most of the time, I do not intend to do it but whenever I think of the future and stress that maybe I will end up really lonely, without family and/or jobless, struggling financially “I could always just kill myself!”

This is, of course, not ideal but as someone who has been dealing with suicidal ideation I can not imagine myself ever not being suicidal and truly wanting to live. But is that enough? Should I settle for this or is there really a possibility of me willingly wanting to live through good and bad, nor matter what?

Are there any of you (or someone you know) that have struggled with suicidal thoughts for a long time and have completely ‘recovered’ from it? If yes, where did you start? How did it happen? What did you have to do? 
I am torn on whether to keep fighting and striving to get even better or to just accepting this is how I will always be.

1697222849.0,What is this feeling called?,"I’m not sure whether to call it derealization, or dissociation or depersonalization or something, but it’s a weird phenomenon that happens when I think about things a little too hard.

For example, one time I was in the midst of kissing my girlfriend and suddenly just felt like I barely knew who she was. I knew what was happening, and I knew it was real, and I knew she was my girlfriend, but I suddenly felt so disconnected and was just wondering “Who is this.. girl? What are we doing?”

It was like she became a stranger, and while I knew she wasn’t, it was just really disorienting.

It’s a bit of an uncanny valley feeling, almost like tripping on acid, and it can make me feel disconnected from anyone or anything for a moment. Sometimes I’ll be with my mom or siblings, and it’s like “Why am I close to this person? Am I actually?” All my past experiences and attachments and memories of this person feel kind of abstract, and they kind of just become this person who I know is my family member, but something is just off and I feel like I have no connection to them anymore.

It’s very brief, and I can just act normal during it, but it’s a weird feeling. Any advice?",mentalhealth

1697190906.0,Social media is harming my mental health. What should I do?,"I've come to realize how my mental health switches due to what I surround myself with, not only in real life, but mostly on social media.
I've come to notice how I follow some people that constantly make ""hate"" posts (usually hating on someone, sharing personal information about people, pictures and messages and making fun of them constantly), that simply talk sh*t about other people on their story almost everyday and start fights for no reason. And dont get me wrong, everyone is free to do whatever they want with their instagram, but seeing this, over and over, it's so unpleasant and just makes me think that one day these posts can be about me and just gives me anxiety for some reason.
Then I think ""better to just unfollow"", but with this type of people I KNOW it would cause drama if they just realized i unfollowed them. So I dont know if I should just ignore and not see their things or what. Most stupid topic ever I know.

But what should I do? Should I unfollow them even though they and their friends might come for me because of it? I'm at a state that I simply cannot handle drama and stress right now and the last thing I want is having these people causing problems.

1697207543.0,Why am I extremely angry every morning,"My first thoughts when I wake up are anger at somebody, and it’s so random. I will wake up and be angry at a kid in class for some small thing, be angry at mom, my partner, an ex, just all over the place. But before I wake it’s like my mind chooses some random circumstance I could be upset about or have been and fixates on it. I will hit my pillow, sit on the floor and cry, vent to myself with so many words of rages, so many unhealthy actions. It’s been this way for like two years. I used to have horrible night mares/terrors. Had to be on medication (didn’t work) and never wanted to sleep because the dreams. I got lots of help over the years and still get them sometimes, so I get why I’m mad those mornings, but no where nears as often (maybe once a month now), so I don’t see why it’s every morning. My mind doesn’t calm down until I smoke weed, which is probably part of the problem. 
It’s a crazy level of anger, like I could easily message people and ruin relationships things I don’t want to ruin, or say consider quitting school because I’m so mad at a classmate (this mornings angry thought, not doing it, but it’s intense).

1697205929.0,I'm getting homeschooled.,"Since a year ago, my school has really turned to crap. School has been terrible for me and everyone else.

My school doesn't even have enough teachers. Teachers in my school have to teach multiple grades and multiple subjects that they weren't trained for. 

 It doesn't help that my school is very poor. We have to line up at lunch (around 350 students in line) in the hottest part of the day to the ONE water fountain 2 hallways away, where we fill up a small styrofoam cup with a small amount of water. My lunch table regularly finds plastic bits in our fruit or in our sandwhiches.

We have a bug infestation, where there's casually roaches either dead on the ground or under the pipes. 

The principle changed all the routes that the kids who walk home from school are allowed to go. Instead of going the short way, we have to walk around the entire school just to get on the main path. Because apparently the short way is ""too dangerous"" when nothing has happened there other than a few scrap fights and some vaping.

School has been terrible for everyone here, and already over 13 students have un-enrolled in just 4 weeks of school starting this year. I don't want to leave my friends, but I don't want to do it anymore.",mentalhealth

1697218104.0,My partner refuses help and I’m incredibly worried about him,"Hi. I’m really new to Reddit, I just need support and input and I don’t know who to go to. My boyfriend and I are both 18 and in college. We’ve been together for a year. He and I both have struggled with our mental health all throughout our lives. I started therapy a year ago and meds a few months ago and I’ve felt significant improvement. My boyfriend has been on several different medications for several years and tried therapy a few months ago. He stopped attending, saying it wasn’t for him. Within the past month or so, he’s talked about feeling like he is at the lowest point of his life. He has expressed that he feels hopeless, that he sees no point in living, that he finds himself worthless and that there is no future. We have discussed topics like this all throughout our relationship and have given support to each other always. I always want to support him and I tell him how proud I am of him for opening up, because I know it’s hard for him. I’ve suggested several times that he tries therapy again, saying maybe his first therapist wasn’t a good match for him as I know a lot of first experiences with therapy sometimes do not turn out well. He talks about feeling like these outlets are fruitless and won’t yield any results. He talks about waking up every day and wanting it to be over. It worries me so much for him because I love him so much and I hate to see him struggling like this. I also know that it is hard to consult another person who has/does struggle with their mental health, and I worry the suggestions and advice that I give him is not the best that he can receive, which is why I’ve tried to encourage him to try therapy again, but he refuses and says that they’ll just tell him what he already knows. He says the medication is unhelpful too. He’s expressed thinking he is helpless and that nothing he does will ever improve the state he’s in. I understand it’s hard to feel hope or motivation in such a state. I’m just so worried to lose him, that he’ll decide it’s not worth it and that there’s nothing I can do to help him anymore. He is the best thing that’s ever happened to me and I love him more than I’ll ever know how to express. What should I do? What can I do?

Like Im here but Im not here. I don’t know how else to describe it, but that’s the best way. It’s not that everything doesn’t feel real, and it’s not that Im viewing myself from outside my body, so that’s why Im not sure if it is derealization. 

However, regardless, it is terrifying. Does anyone know how to get this to stop or if there’s anything I can do? These feelings will last a day or two and then go away, they also are most prominent when Im not distracted with something else.

When i woke up at 5am to go to the gym, I was afraid to leave the house because i was convinced i would be seeing what i saw i my dream, Or that something bad would happen.

I love true crime but have not been watching for the past few months because of this paranoia.

of the symptoms i’ve had are getting worse. I have dealt with depression/anxiety for my whole life but the older i get the more paranoid i am (sometimes nearing debilitating levels), i have noticed more OCD tendencies, and physical reactions to stress(twitching, nausea, dizziness, disassociation)

Recently I've been more sad then anything, and I used to enjoy many things. But not now. I do think of hypothetical scenarios on how I could of been a better person overall in the past. But I can't change the past. It's something I have to live with until the day I end up in a cemetery. 

I also have fake thoughts of having friends, happiness, having a good time,  a good life and job. More then anything, I don't really want to make friends or communicate with people anymore. It's not like I had anyone to communicate with, other then one person. I would end it, but I won't because I love my family.

I started working in late 2017 and my routine adapted to it: I used to wake up early to do my bed and clean up before going to work, so I could relax in the evening and enjoy my days off. 

I kept doing that until October last year. I vividly remember one day, I woke up at 5am (I leave for work at around 8am) and I felt super tired. ""I'll do it tomorrow"", I thought. I've never considered cleaning a chore, I liked the results so much that it almost felt relaxing to me.

1697207623.0,caught my bf lying several times,"My boyfriend and I met online. We talked and fell in love. He usually likes to talk about his life - ups and down. I’m the type of who likes to listen and encourages him when he feels down. Our relationship consists of phone calls for hours talking about life - our past, present, and day dreaming. We also watch movies together while we are on calls. 

I have a hunch that some information he is sharing with me are modified but I’m puzzled to why he would do that. 

First - Age. I understand that he gave his age younger than his actual. He gave 27 instead of 33. I was 29 then. He let me believed he was 2 years ago for several months. As my curiousity grew, I discovered online that he is older than what he says. He pretended to be that age while I knew in the background. One day, I confronted him about it. He was very sorry and said he trying to find a timing to say it. 

Second - Old Habit. Please don’t judge me but lend him almost 2k usd without seeing his face and meeting him. This is big because we lived in third world country. After, 4 weeks, he confessed that he lost money of 4k usd from online casino. His capital was 400 usd. I got angry because he could have paid me but guess dopamine pushed him to give more. This is lying to me because along those 4 weeks, he kept to himself and asked me some money because he doesn’t have any. I can’t remember his reasons why. 

Third - Employment History. For some reasons, I am really good at uncovering information from the internet. I asked him where we previously worked (where I have information to validate it). He chose to lie. Now I don’t even know whether the present employer is even what he says it is. 

Further info: 

There were also some information he shared that matches the info from the internet.

We haven’t seen each other not even via video call. I have been flying to his city 3 times but he said he doesn’t want to meet me at his financial state. 

I noticed he likes to use dummy account because for some reasons he still doesn’t want to connect to main account — he had so many bad relationships

I love him. I always want to keep him safe because he has no one. He has depression. 

I developed anxiety during the course of our relationship. Partly, I am worried he won’t pay me back but he promised he will. He is very sensitive and cries a lot when subject are discussed.

He spends a lot of time with me and even a great primary support when I have big problems.

I can’t tell my family and friends because I cheated for this guy. Eventually my other boyfriend left me after 4 months of confession. I’ve been cheating for 8 months or so. 

Im the type who likes to fix people. I probably need help

Questions

1. Is he authentic about our relationship?

2. Any red flags?

3. Im at this point of deciding of breaking the relationship but I am worried that he won’t return my money back plus he doesn’t anyone. 

4. Should I see a psychologist now?",mentalhealth
1697205393.0,"Going cold turkey on medication, need advice","Hello. Im 23 year old man and Im diagnozed with unspecified schyzoprenia. I suffer from blunted emotions. I think i don't value my own experience too much and i fantasise about vanishing from space and time. This discreditation of my own experience results in my poor memory. I rarely experience positive emotions. I sometimes cry just to make myself feel alive. And I sometimes take enjoyment out of that, contradictory. I feel like a mess and i can't communicate it clearly to the outside world, and when i do i feel misunderstood. 

I sometimes wonder if I have unspecified schyzoprenia at all. It started when I was teenager and I started taking antidepressants for depression. I was very closed off and isolated. The antidepressants started my psychosis which started as a result of me not being able to sleep by taking them. I started having panick attacks and fear of the present moment. I wonder if this wasn't a signs of unspecified schizophrenia but simply sleep deprivation.

Maybe the the proces of me being in the mental hospital under supervision of doctors made me beleive i was actually crazy or there is something wrong.

I feel excluded from expering what it means to be human. I want to feel alive again, experience joy, excitement, laughter and pleasure and sadness at appropriate times. 

Could someone tell me if its a good idea to go of the meds completely cold turkey?",mentalhealth
1697204644.0,dropped out of highschool and don't know if i should go back???,"hi guys im looking for some advice, ive already talked about this topic before but i got logged out of my old account so im asking again

im struggling with figuring out what to do with my education

im 17 turning 18 early next year and i am meant to be in year 12 this year. last year i was in yeae 11 and i only got 1 term in before my mental health declined extremely quickly and i wasnt able to attend anymore, for half the year in 2022 i was trying to get help in order to go back to school, and was still getting suppourt from my school in hopes of being able to go back, but i didnt get better and had to leave my highschool. the rest of last year was spent in one of the darkest periods of my life, i was out of school and hadnt seen any friends and didnt leave the house more than an occasional appointment with a new therapist that would eventually not work out.

at the start of this year, i went to a new school and was going to redo year 11. i ended up not attending again. i tried my hardest but i still failed and i only went for a few weeks before i nearly had to leave.

then after a 2 week break i got given a second chance to come back for term 2, i was lucky enough that the previous 1 term of yr 11 i did complete in 2022 could be transfered over, and i was so happy. this was a miracld to me because i genuinely thought it was over and i ruined my life and i was a dissapointment. 

anyway i went to an appointment with my principal and he said that in order for me to go back to school, i would have to prove i could attend, meaning for the next 2 weeks i would have to come every single day. immediately in that moment i knew that i had no chance, i couldnt do that, but i told them i could. 

tw/ SI OD

on the drive home i was planning my attempt and oded and was in hostpital for a few weeks. after that i got given a new therapist immediately and the rest of this year was spent waiting for the days to pass untill i had my appointments. i had another od in this time, but i didnt get as much suppourt as before.

so a few months ago i stopped seeing this therapist because i stopped showing up to my appointments, i just couldnt bring myself to do anything, so for the past 2 or 4 months up untill now ive been without suppourt and its been horrendous. 

my parents are trying to get me another one but its too hard because ive already seen all of them near our area. im so sad i wish i opened up to any therapist, because maybe then i could have gotten some real help and been better by now, but i was so closed off and scared. now i wish i had someone to talk to, i have zero suppourt and i really need it.

im struggling with the idea of studying because my parents are thinking of online school next year, but i dont know if i want to go back to redoing yr 11 and 12 to graduate, or if i should just try doing something else. im so confused and just need someone to ask about all of this. ever since i was little ive been so smart and gifted and always put 100 percent into my studies, and the years where it actually mattered i failed. 

ive lost contact with alot of friends from school but have recently been reconnecting with them, but its so hard hearing about all their goals and aspirations, and soon they will all graduate together, and it hurts so much knowing that i wont get to graduate with my friends. im not going to be there with them, im not going to be there with my class, the group of people ive been with for years. it really hurts i wish i could turn back time and force myself to get up and go to school. but i cant. they are all doing their exams now, and it sounds silly but i would do anything to be sitting with them in class struggling with the same exams as them. they are all so busy with life and i wish i could say the same

i feel so behind not only education wise, but in every other aspect, everyone else my age is doing imporant things for their future and have actual lives but im just rotting away in my room. they are talking about the colleges they are getting into and im so happy for them but im also really jealous, i wish i could be normal and functioning

if i want to graduate highschool it would take me like 2 years, and i would graduate at 19, whcih i know isnt bad but it feels so embarassing and i feel so lonely and different, so by the time i graduate all my friends will probably be 2 years into their college courses, maybe moved out, working, travelling idk but i can barely take care of myself without help.

i keep telling myself i need to graduate in order to feel important, to have accomplished something, ill be nothing without a diploma, ill never get far in life without that, it will be so much harder to do anything without it and ill have to prove myself way more to get into courses and other things. i dont want to say im a highschool dropout, it feels terrible. but i know that its not something to be ashamed of and everyone goes at their own pace and im not behind, but it is really hard not to think that. 

also if i do enrol next year it will be in april, so what am i menat to do untill then? just sit here should i get a job? the idea of working makes me want to throw up i cant even cook without ruining it, i feel like a 12 year old in an adult body. im hoping this online school couse is flexible

why cant i just smash out all the important assignments and exams and do both yr 11 and 12 in 1 year why does it have to be like that, why cant i just sit and take exams over and over why is the school curriculum like this im so mad at how much a want a stupid piece of paper that says i finished highschool. the only reason o want it is so that i can rot for like 5 years and i someday i do end up getting better i can just go to university or something but if i dont get it soon, then in 5 years it will be way harder to want to go back again ahhh idk 

sorry im just so confused and i just wish someone older and wiser could just help me and reach out a hand and pull me from this hole im stuck in. sorry this is very long and very messy to read and theres probably alot of typos but i just had to get it out. im not even sure if this will reach anyone but if u have read this far, genuinely thank you it means the world to me

thank u so much stay safe <3

It caused me to have severe debilitating anxiety and fear about being in public about the possibility of having another mental breakdown in public almost to the point of passing out. Honestly, the best thing for me was to be left alone in my house and not hang out with anyone. My family didn't understand this and always begged me to do things with them. I said no many times and they looked down on me. My brother for two years has been begging me to go to the gym and do a boot camp program. I told him I was not ready a thousand times. I work out at home and lost 70 pounds. I’ve gotten a lot better about being in public and I talked to a church friend about going to a gym and trying the bootcamp thing.

1697202434.0,i hate one part of me,"⚠️slight talk about sexual assault ⚠️


im 19f and i love myself but also hate apart of myself alot, for the past couple years, i have been so unbelievably angry for how i am, and it always loops back to, if god actually created us i would be so mad at him and upset because i just hate who i am and he made me this way even tho i dont want it, im not a very sexual person and identify as demi-greyace, and dont want to take part in it unless i really love the person, and i prefer the romantic part of relationship more then anything and even if i did want to have sexual stuff with them, it wouldnt be much happening, and very rare, but i have this hatred for it, i always ask why am i this way, why am i broken and so useless and ugly,  i understand not everyone needs sex in relationships and stuff, but i grew up thinking that and its hard to get out of the mindset when all i have been proved is right, and no matter how much i get told that ill find the one, or it will pass or a man saying ""i dont need sex"", it never helps, it never does anything, or it ends up the guy needing/wanting something from me, and thats okay if someone prefers to have sex/same sex drive with someone, but i always i go back into this knoted ball of anger, and dont understand anything, because i know how much more difficult it will be for me to find love. to find just someone, and have them truly understand how i feel and respect that, and my past with sexual assault definitely has to deal with this hatred and my sexuality, and my last relationship, 

the whole time i knew if i didnt do the things for him, i wouldnt be fully accepted, and loved and, i would be left in the dust, and i hate that, i hate it so much, i just want to be less different, and be able to believe i can somewhat be loved by a person, mostly a man, and i cant physically or mentally do anything about it, its just me, and i have accepted its how i am but i havent been able to love it, and i dont think i can ever love it, i wish i was more sexual just because i want to be ""loved"" and have a higher chance to be loved. And i used to sexualize myself on my own and think how my body is the only thing really going for me, and i should put good use to it, and how no man could ever look at me in the face and see into my head and love me, only there to love my body, and its to the point i have to check my outfits to see if the right places are out, and look good and im trying to tell myself it doesn't matter, and it wouldnt be real love if my body is the only good thing, but it still breakes me down, and im just fighting with myself. 

and i believe making love is a very beautiful thing to experience with a partner, and i enjoy some parts, but knowing and feeling like 99.9% of the men i will meet will with out a doubt want/need/end up wanting to have sex, and not be able to be with me, and me just not being able to give that, is so hurtful to me, because i feel so out of the loop, i feel broken, and of course they can still have feelings for me, but i always feel like i get curbed stomped when having to get told or thinking about getting told, yeah this would be a great relationship but you cant fuck, sorry, and i know love isn't just to have sex with your partner and i know the love i want but, i always end up blaming and hating myself because im not the normal one, they are, they have the ""normal"" instincts and i dont, and it just breaks me. and its no ones fault in the end, and people want what they want, but why do i have to want different things. it makes me, the person who loves romance, and just love, and experiencing it SO MUCH harder, and again i know what i want in a true relationship but i always have my doubts it will end because of me not being sexual. and scared that will shoo every man i meet away to the point i will change and force myself to do anything. i just want someone to admire me the way i admire them, and just love. without sex. and im at a war, and idk if true me will win. because i will and have put myself through situations, example with my ex because i know he wanted it and i did it because i loved him but i thinks its ruined me more than ever. We dated for 2 years and he wanted sexual stuff, even over the phone, and i did them but i truly didnt want to and ofc there's other reasons why we broke up but i know one was because i wasnt sexual. and it hurts, and call me out for wanting ""shallow"" love or whatever you want to call it but i hate this part of me so much, its better to act normal then be myself just to feel something from someone and feel useful and not a broken shell, but of course no matter what that feeling is always there. idk anymore, i just have been accepting ill die alone.",mentalhealth

Ever since I have started college ive started college ive had no appetite to eat anything at all and when i do i get very nauseous and feel like im gonna get sick immedietly even tho what im eating might only be small or else it will take me forever to slowly get through the food. I have a feeling that this may be some sort of symptom of social anxiety or something but i would consider myself socialable person and i think that subconsiouscly i have this issue. Ive always been a very self consioucs and iver think everything and have struggled with this. Over the summer i was very much on my own as i live far away from where i went to school so rarely got to do any activities with my friends. A reason that may have caused this sub consioucs feeling was from my irish equivalent of prom, One of my ""friends"" was drunk and spent alot of the night abusing me making fun of my weight appearance and how no one wanted me their. i fear that this has had a negative impact on how i feel in college. To some it up im just wondering how i can try to reduce this feeling of nauseous i get when eating food and sometimes just feel anyway while in my lectures where im around people.

Luckily, my son slept through the whole thing and was quickly taken out of the house by his father while I called 911.

Felt like a disappointment because I dropped out of college, worked as a personal trainer at a gym where I was taken advantage of and forced to work 16-17 hour days for pennies. Lived in some slummy apartments with no AC and barely had any grocery money. I usually bummed pizza from local Pizza shops at the end of the night when someone hadn’t picked up a carry out order.

1588697499.0,I think that “13 reasons why” is a very bad way of “spreading awareness”,"As the title suggests, I think that 13RW is a very bad portrayal of mental health, suicide, depression etc. and it shouldn’t be promoted as a show that “raises awareness”, when it’s just harmful. It portrays suicide as something “beautiful” and “meaningful” and not what it really is. And the whole “blame it on other people even though they tried to help me” thing? Nope nope nope, that’s so toxic. Idk if I just feel that way because of my PTSD (an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because I didn’t “help him enough” even though I did everything I could and was only 13), but it’s just not really how suicide should be portrayed, in my opinion. Also, the way they show flashbacks of Hannah Baker from when she was alive makes it seem like she’s still alive in some way. They reeeeally push this harmful “suicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people” agenda, when in reality, suicide is often the exact opposite. 
Idk, personally I really don’t like that show, and i think it’s harmful. I once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend, and she was all like “who made you feel that way?” like it was other people’s fault. Like sure, trauma and toxic relationships with people can worsen suicidal thoughts and depression but I just don’t feel like the show portrayed it in a helpful way.",mentalhealth

Then one day out of the blue, my boyfriend went into my closet and grabbed me one of his t- shirts, (my) underwear, and (my) shorts. He propped me up and undressed, then dressed me while my eyes swelled up. He didn’t even ask. He just did it.

1607228909.0,"Just had my cousin's memorial on Zoom, and it was atrocious.","My cousin recently killed herself. We were close when we were growing up. Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. 

I'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she ""succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19"" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to ""heaven"" and not ""hell"" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed ""sin"". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.

I posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying ""Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not."" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. 

They fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. 

I'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the ""eyes of God"". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.

I feel so bad for her. If her parents made \*me\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them.

But in the past I hated myself and attempted to end my life on a handfull of occasions, getting always closer to breaking and doing it.

Maybe three month ago I was approched by a social worker and he helped me find my way to a home for young men in rough situations in just a couple of weeks. It is still hard to belive how easy that was. For about a month and a half I just kinda houng out and got acclimated but kept some of my old habbits up (not drugs, just kinda being aimless). With Corona crashing the party, I spend all of my time at home and lazed around.

But this week I started to work in the extensive garden. Planting crops, installing watering systems and stuff. Today I planted 100+ onions, waterd some salat and cleaned up a volleyball field. I felt good doing that. Then I had myself a nice cold shower and sat down to write this. Im happy right now. Im happy that I enjoyed work. I put the fear that all this shit in my life was because Im just lazy behind me. I enjoy working. Im crying.",mentalhealth

1656227088.0,My cat stopped me from committing suicide.,"Today something very weird happened. I began to have very suicidal thoughts, but my cat stepped in. You may think i’m making this up but i’m not i swear.
Tonight I held a knife to myself, and my cat ran to my side. At first I thought he was just trying to cuddle or get me to pet him, but I then noticed instead of rubbing into my hand, he was pushing the knife away. I broke down into tears and he immediately climbed into my lap. I moved and he laid beside me, and now refuses to let me out of his sight. His little paw is sitting on my arm, and when i move he moves. This is insane, but he stopped it, if it wasn’t for my cat i’d be dead. I can’t thank him enough, he’s my angel baby. I love him so much.

Update: I’m better, I decided to stay for him. Mentally I’m not okay, but I’m working on myself and I will get better soon. Thank you all for the love and support! Ive been getting more love from strangers than I get from friends and family. It means the world to me.❤️

Edit: I will not be showing pictures of my cat. Not in a mean way, but in a way for my privacy. I came on here to be “anonymous” in ways, just so if someone i personally know comes across this they can’t tell it’s me. Thank you for all the support, it means a lot. I just wanted to share what saved my life last night.

Another Update: Hi! so I wanted to come back on here and give y’all a new update. First off, thank you ALL for so much support and love! It means the world to me, for a few weeks I kept coming back to this post. Basically, I’m doing amazing. I have new school opportunities, a new relationship, new friends. My life has truly turned around. I got out of my toxic relationship, healed, found to love myself again, and now I’m loved by the most amazing guy. Thank you all, you helped me all through a very hard time! If anyone feels the way I felt in this post, please, feel free to reach out to me, call help, trust me on this. I’ve had to do it, it’s not scary trust me. But my messages are totally free for anyone who needs anything! Much love!",mentalhealth
1605618561.0,My mom broke up with me for Donald Trump,"About a week ago, my mom told me she wasn't interested in corresponding any further after Trump lost. I'm a gay trans person so I obviously voted Biden.

It really sucks that my mom has abandoned me for a cult.


EDIT: Thank you to all the kind and supportive people. This really hurts, but your empathy is a comfort.

To the folks that think I'm exaggerating or leaving something out, I implore you to drive to a small town, then take in the Trump bumper stickers on every car and Trump banners beside every house. I've driven by multiple Biden road signs with bullet holes in them out in the middle of nowhere. 

I have been trying to get my parents to stop berating me with Trump news for more than four years now. They have ruined dinners out, caused friction in relationships, and generally made my life stressful since the day he decided to run for office by talking about him constantly, aggressively, and refusing to listen to what anyone else has to say. This is not on me or for lack of trying to understand their POV.

I really don't think I'm exaggerating or being rude to state that this is cult-like behavior. A cult is literally defined as ""a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object."" This definitely fits the bill for a lot of small town Americans. Especially if you live in a city, take a look outside the concrete jungle and it's not hard to see why rural folks initially get sucked into this shit.",mentalhealth

1590612861.0,Does anyone else get angry about how much effort you have to put in to stay stable?,"I woke up exhausted, feeling like sand was holding me down. 

But I knew the sand wasn’t real. I was capable of being a function human, so I decided to be one. I got out of bed, showered and brushed my teeth, I put on clothes and left the house briefly to shop. And then I binge ate crap food, drank vodka, watched 10 hours of tv whilst taking lots of pain meds for back trouble. 

I’m not really sure what I’m trying to say. I guess I want people to know that I tried. I fought back at my body and forced myself up, forced myself to do the bare minimum of existing and damnit - I was so proud. I want the satisfaction of ‘doing the healthy thing’ even though it was hard, and then I want the reward to be a sudden ability to live easily. 

But it didn’t come. I gave in to the dull ache of sadness and consumed sugar, salt and digital crap until I felt sick. I’m back in bed now thinking about every mistake I made today and how I wish I was stronger. 

I know that a path back to a healthy mental space/ lifestyle is going to be a long, hard road after neglecting it for so long. And I know I have to do it, and do it now before it deteriorates further. I just wish it wasn’t so intensely challenging. I wish that I didn’t have to eat healthily, exercise, keep a tidy house, be social JUST TO STAY AFLOAT.

Missing a run means missing on the happy endorphins I rely on to keep me going through the day. Having an unhealthy meal makes me sluggish, that in turn makes me feel that tiny bit worse which is enough to make me not do chores. I hate being in such a fragile state where i’m not quite mega-depressed, just always on the verge of not leaving my bed for 48 hours.

I'm. Not sure if it's even this subreddit but I'm trying my luck. 

I lost my old account and don't remember it at all, because I changed my phone alot within those times.

I was a 16 years old male with Bulimia Nervosa, I opened up here about my issues and alot of you good folks helped me. 

A random user reached out to me and started helping out, by giving me advice and opened up to me about her own problems. She gave me a place to vent and someone to reach out to. 

Now I haven't been bulimic for the last 2 years (20 now), I did it solely from education and will which I'm proud of, because proper therapy is not accessible here. I started exercising, and educated myself alot about nutrition and physical health, I sometimes relapse, but very rarely (once a day every couple of months or so). And she definetly helped me alot. And I want to thank her, and talk to her. Oh Boi do I have alot of stories to tell her about (unfortunately not all are good). 

She is a married middle aged woman with kids, she is Pyromaniac, would talk to me about it and  about her daily routine of how she handles it.

1605033470.0,Adopted a cat during quarantine and it is unbelievable how our bond together has helped ease the pains of isolation.,"So long story short, a couple months ago I was losing my mind feeling trapped inside my apartment with very little to do. Like many of you, probably. It was just me and my roommate going about our usual routine, and life just seemed so... bleak. Then my friend asked if I could babysit his kitten and it was a game changer. I found out cuddling, nuzzling, feeding and caring for a cat was so rewarding and realized how special the bond between cats and humans are. So I adopted my own kitten a few weeks later, and we fell instantly in love with each other. I have so much time to appreciate the little moments between us, to watch him grow, and to witness our bond grow stronger everyday because we spend so much time together. Not only that, but I feel more confident in reaching out to my friends and family on social media/phone again because I don’t feel alone anymore. I would say if you are feeling alone or you are looking for a sense of purpose during this time, I highly recommend getting a pet, because this is a rare occasion where your bond with your pet will be stronger than ever. If you want to follow my cat on IG, I post almost every day and you can watch him grow too. @finn_the_feline_._._

1612112590.0,CW: Suicide. I almost took my life. Twice. Therapy saved me. But my therapist didn’t. Here’s what I mean.,"TL;DR please seek help if you are struggling, if you’re unhappy, or even if you’re happy and want to stay that way. There is a light. 

3 years ago, my family home was foreclosed on. 2 years ago my mom had a stroke and was paralyzed and left unable to speak. 3 months ago she passed away after a long battle. I haven’t been able to speak to my best friend for 2 years and now I’ll never be able to. 

Within that time, I had two suicide attempts. I was on pills. I was drinking alone everyday. I was hospitalized. I was uninsured. I was homeless. I thought I was beyond repair. 

For two years now since then, I’ve been in therapy. Every week for two years. 

Now, I’m engaged. An awesome step son. I have a good job. A nice place to live. I’m excited for the future. 

Therapy saved me. But not my therapist. 

My therapist is amazing. He’s smart. Insightful. Knows when to listen. But when I started therapy, I thought my therapist would just tell me what to do. I’d do it. And I’d be fixed. 

That’s not how it worked for me. 

A lot of my friends who aren’t in therapy have been afraid to, or too stubborn to go seek help. 

They think they know better than a professional. BUT HERES THE RUB: My therapist didn’t know how to fix me. 

I did. 

(For me personally) therapy has been about bringing out repressed thoughts and feelings. Things I couldn’t talk to my friends about. Couldn’t talk about with my family.

Therapy also made me take accountability. For all my mistakes, the people I’ve wronged.

I can now accept my past and look to the future. A future I wanted to take away from myself. 

I hope if even one person reads this and feels inclined to help themselves. Because you can. 

P.S. I’m new to Reddit. And I like it a lot. I’ve already made friends. If you need a friend, I’m here!",mentalhealth

A reminder to always be kind. 

“I want to talk about a few months ago when pictures of a noticeably thin Chadwick Boseman were going around the internet. I remember people taking it upon themselves to make jokes, tweets, memes, etc. about the change in his appearance. They called him “crack panther”.

It's literally the same phrases every time. It's like they are a bunch of robots. So goddamn repetitive and predictable.

Don’t give up!","Although I myself still struggle after being raped nearly 2 and a half years ago (and the rape will impact me my whole life) I want to let you know that time really heals wounds.

After, I got raped it was the worst time in my life. There are no words to describe how horrible it was. From a person who was very confident, lived in multiple countries, travelled the world I was afraid to go to my local grocery shop. I nearly had a panic attack when I was alone with a man in a shopping aisle. I had to postpone all my exams, my academic and social life suffered immensely. I had PTSD, anxiety, depression etc. I had very dark thoughts. I considered taking a year out of university because just getting out of bed was a struggle for me. I could write a book about all the negative effects of rape.

But now I honestly feel so much better. Of course, I still suffer the effects. But compared to the past I have made great progress. I am planning to continue my therapy though as I feel like my healing process is not over.

But I want to let you know that things will get better. I have graduated from top 30 university in the world with a prestigious degree, last year I was a committee member of multiple societies at my university. I am looking forward to life.

One thing I would tell you is that don’t put a timeline or deadline for your recovery. And don't compare yourself to others. I used to wonder will I ever get better. Why I am not getting better already? Why is it taking so long? Don’t compare your recovery to someone else. Although I will recover the whole of my life, what I mean is that If you are not getting better/progressing in a certain period of time is okay.

Everyone is different and take as much time you need to heal.

For me, it was also hard to see all my friends enjoying life and this tragedy happening to me. But now I am slowly accepting that life didn’t turn out exactly the way I wanted. And bad things happened to good people.

I am posting this because I felt much better myself reading stories of rape victims that persevered and ‘overcame’ their trauma.

I understand where people come from when they say the first season glorified suicide. Personally, I believe the first season had good intentions, and truly was trying to raise awareness for suicide.

Of course, they completely sabotaged Hannah Baker’s character in S2, which had a detrimental effect on the message.

But Season 4 - oh, it makes my blood boil. Clay’s undiagnosed, undefined “mental illness” - at best described by the show as “trauma” - is used as an excuse for outrageously bad behavior. By bad behavior, I mean locking his friends in a cabin in the woods and clanging an axe against the door. I mean vandalizing his school and burning his principal’s car. I mean waving a gun around in front of the entire student body.

And worst of all, when he finds out his adoptive brother is dying, his immediate response is to run to the police station and yell, “I’ve got a gun!” Why? Because he needed people “to see how broken he was.”

This one really hit me close to home. When I was 6, my infant sister had to spend all 4.5 months of her life on a ventilator in the hospital. When she died - near Christmas time - I did not go terrorize people so that they could see “how broken I was.”

Yet [few people](https://youtu.be/ynewf90xWZc) see it that way. When I say this, 13 RW fans tell me “Well, you were 6. Your emotions were not as deep as our beloved FICTIONAL character Clay.”

I hate what that show became, and the perverse effect it has.

EDIT

Thank you for all of the heartfelt responses and experiences you have shared. I truly had started to believe I was in the minority with my critique of 13 Reasons Why. I’m glad to know there are others who share the same concerns.",mentalhealth

Today is my 24th birthday. I normally live at home with my family but I've had to move out for their safety. I haven't seen any family or friends in 2 months now.

I rang in my 24th today in a room with a baby suspected for COVID-19 who was very sick. I was holding the baby while the doctor was doing a lumbar puncture. Wearing the same mask I've been wearing all day and full gown, face shields, gloves.

I could feel my phone vibrating with messages from friends/family. I'm not even an emotional person but I just started crying silently. Everyone was so concentrated that no one noticed. I went to the back after and spent 20 mins having a good cry while listening to the stable song from BOTW (LOL).

I wasn't sad about working on my birthday, having to wear sweaty PPE all day or even having to deal with a sick baby (I deal with them all the time). I think I was just so overwhelmed the last few weeks and this was the first time I let my emotions out.

1599744998.0,I feel bad for my cat because we don’t have a routine anymore.,"When I had a predictable schedule, my cat would make sure I followed it to the letter every morning.

He woke me up right before my alarm so there was time for me to pet him. Then would hop off and meow until I got out of bed. Then led me to the bathroom, and would wait on top of the toilet until I was done showering. If I took longer than ten minutes he’d start meowing. Then he’d sit on top of my counter and watch me brush my teeth, and try to grab the floss as I was using it. Then he would hop down and strut in front of me, looking behind to make sure I was following, and lead me to my bag. Once I picked up my bag, he’d lead me downstairs to the kitchen. He would then sit on one of the chairs and watch me cook and eat breakfast, and when I was getting all ready to leave, he would wait for me to walk over and pet him goodbye for the day.

When I got home, he’d be waiting for me. He’d lead me back upstairs and stand in the spot my bag’s supposed to go. Then we’d play fetch with toy balls and I’d give him lots of pets until we tired out. Then I would get on the computer for work and games, and he’d hop into his cat bed nearby and fall asleep. When it was time for bed, he sometimes even got up to lead me to the bathroom and make sure I was brushing my teeth, then go back to bed.

Since the pandemic started, I’ve had nowhere to go. Nothing to do. And even several months later, I can tell he misses the routine. He still tries to wake me up on time. He’s been trying different tactics. The most effective one so far seems to be bringing a toy and doing cuddle rolls just out of reach of the bed so I have to get up to pet him. He still meows if I’m in the shower for more than ten minutes. When I do finally go downstairs, he rushes ahead of me halfway down and leads me the rest of the way. He frequently makes circles around my feet as I’m on the computer, asking for pets and playtime. It breaks me heart when he does these things. I know he’s trying so hard.

Literally the most caring individual when it comes to me taking care of myself is my cat. But lot of his effort goes in vain, and it wracks me with guilt and appreciation every morning to watch him try.",mentalhealth

I wrote my suicide note this morning and my plan was to take my pistol and end it all tonight when I got home from work. I had everything planned and I was set. Then this evening I was at work delivering pizzas. I went to this one house and I wasn’t sure if I was at the right address or not but there was a man in the driveway and I asked him if I was at the right address. He said he wasn’t sure because it was his bosses house, not his, and he was only there to pick up his car. Then we started talking and he mentioned how I was smiling. He spoke about how he was 63 years old, he was a military veteran, and how with people my age he doesn’t see people smile like I did. It was a fake smile I put on so when I greet customers it’s a good experience. But he picked up on my smile, we chatted and he was making me laugh, he ended up giving me a big hug and was telling me how I should appreciate my friends, my family, and life. This guy had no clue I was depressed and suicidal and was planning on taking my life 3 hours later, yet he still told me all of this. He ended up giving me some cheese he had (I didn’t eat it) but the reason why he gave it to me is because  the packaging had a huge smile on it and he told me to have it and to keep on smiling and spreading positivity. 

This guy was only at the house to pick up his car, he was only there for 5 minutes, yet in that 5 minutes is when I showed up. If that delivery was 5 minutes earlier or 5 minutes later I would have already taken my life, but the timing was perfect, and I’m still here. I’m not a super religious person, but I truly believe this man was my saving grace, he was sent by god to let me know it’s not my time to go. I gotta keep fighting.

She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open. I bring this up because I cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex. The noises and the shaking.

If they are trying hard to hide it, it's possible they're struggling more since they have to hold it in. Also, if someones symptoms don't seem as severe as your own, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem and therefore aren't entitled to get help. Kids shouldn't need to come out about being depressed by attempting suicide because they have no other way to prove it's a real problem that they deal with. And they definitely shouldn't have to go as far as to commit suicide to show they've struggled.

&#x200B;

I want people to get help without being told their OCD is for attention, and that their depression is just an excuse to be lazy, their anxiety is just an excuse to avoid doing things, or their ADHD is just an excuse to misbehave. If people are so worried over others faking this stuff for pity, then maybe don't give them pity and that's the problem solved then? Instead of giving them the things you think they're faking problems to get, try to push them to see professional help and leave it at that instead of going out of your way to make it worse for them.

&#x200B;

Nobody should be allowed to do terrible things and get away with it by blaming their disorder, I get that. If someone you know is doing that, treat it like the law does: don't punish or hate them, but maybe send them to a psych ward to get help if they truthfully are harming others because they can't control themselves.

&#x200B;

If anyone out there is afraid to come out about a struggle of theirs because they're afraid of being called an attention seeker, don't hold back because of people like this. Know that bottling it up will make it worse over time. Tell someone that will understand (maybe a school psychologist or a doctor) before it becomes too severe to fix easily.

Every day I see posts making anxiety seem like a trendy thing to have, and making it seem like overcoming depression is a necessary factor of a success story. 

And the amount of times I’ve seen people sharing posts about mental health on their stories or pages, things like “make sure you check up on your friends”, now I don’t know about you but practically none of the people who post things like that I have had check on me, whether in person or over message, and nor have I seen them check on others.

earlier this morning my school got shot up. it was the most terrifying moment of my life, i heard gunshots and screams and ran as fast as i could off of campus. i’m safe, and my friends are safe, but multiple kids didn’t. 
i feel like i’m dreaming. i feel like nothing is real and my brain is so foggy. i don’t feel safe anywhere anymore and the thought of going back to school makes me sick. i keep hearing the gunshots over and over again in my head. please give me advice.

1598043950.0,You don't need to have a crazy story to be valid,"I have had an insane life full of dark trauma, abuse, alcoholism, suicide, despair, extreme loss, stalking, harassment, and destitution. For years I wanted to die and I begged my mother for permission to die to end my suffering. I literally got my brain zapped 14 times to fight it (ECT is actually very safe and effective for severe treatment resistant depression). But all those labels don't matter.

So let me tell you a few things: 

1. Your suffering is as equally valid as mine. 
2. Everything is relative. You can have an amazing life and still be suffering.
3. Your suffering does not need justification. You feel what you feel. Screw invalidating statements like ""It's just hormones"".
4. We all have our own journey don't compare your life/struggles to those of others.
5. You deserve growth as a human being even if you don't feel like you do. Our illnesses cloud our perspective of the past, present, and future.
6. Don't believe everything you think.
7. There is no ""cure"". Suffering is part of human existence and by learning to accept it and sit with it we can overcome it.

1573251025.0,Would someone take the time to wish me a happy birthday? I don't have anyone and don't want to feel so alone today.,"Today is my birthday and this sounds pretty sad, but I just want someone to wish me a happy birthday and maybe say something nice. I no longer have any friends or family left and just want some sort of human connection, even if it is just over Reddit, to make me feel just a bit less isolated and forgotten.

I have just endured so much lately and I don't have anyone to talk to or confide in, but I thought I could make it through today just fine. I was wrong. I feel stupid and pitiful while I'm typing this, but I just want to know someone is out there and understands.Getting to this point happened without me even realizing how solitary I had become until I was completely alone. I might as well lay it out, as just the act of typing it might be some sort of catharsis.

So how did I end up here? I started typing out damn near my whole life story, but that made this post so long that if I left it included there was an even smaller chance someone would read this. So highlights then? Abandoned by parents, raised by grandparents, abused by neighbor from ages 5 to 8, horrible abandonment issues, started getting into drugs, dropped out of high school, got a GED, some life happened, was totally Goth, some more life happened, made some music and art, now only Goth on the inside, started college, got married, wife left and grandparents arrested/institutionalized due to Alzheimer's/dementia in the same weekend, abruptly left college to move home to sort everything out, oh hey drugs, slowly watched my only family deteriorate before my eyes until they didn't even recognize me any longer, raging heroin addiction to try not to feel any of this, grandfather died, got in trouble with the law, lost everything I owned, homeless junkie interlude, lost almost 3 years of my life in jail/prison over less than $4,000 worth of bad checks, oops can't get a decent job due to criminal record, congestive heart failure, almost die, start getting my life back together, meet a nice girl, marry nice girl, grandmother dies, oh hey again drugs, finally got off the drugs, surprise wife departure, heart failure keeps getting worse, can barely walk, can't work anymore, no job, no insurance, no access to healthcare.

That about sums it up the backstory. I finally have gotten some healthcare and counseling. Sadly, I can no longer work. I'm trying to go through the disability process, but that takes a great deal of time. It is difficult without proper access to the doctors I need, but I'm getting there. I've also been clean for 4 years and I'm never going back to that dependence. Never before in my life did I ever feel like I was completely done with drugs, but this time it has really stuck. Haven't even had any cravings and now it never even crosses my mind. I'm finally in a good and stable place in my recovery.

Now I have other issues though. Poverty is very real. The threat of eviction looms nearly every month. Being able to afford the 12 different prescriptions I take is really hard and I find myself cutting pills in half because even $70 a month for medicine is a real challenge. I was able to get enrolled back in college and that is the plan of how to survive until I graduate and find work I'm physically able to handle. I'm working towards a career in counseling because I want to be able to use all of these nightmare experiences to help other people. I want to use what time I have left on this planet to help others and hopefully leave it better than I found it.

That is how you end up alone on your 40th birthday, typing on an ancient laptop that you pray survives a couple more months until you transfer schools and can get a replacement with financial aid funds. My family died. Drugs pushed everyone away for years except other drug addicts and an addict isn't anyone's friend. I am no longer able to work, so I don't have those human connections anymore. My wife had been my best friend, so when she surprised me by suddenly leaving the last person I had a connection with went with her. Now that my congestive heart failure has progressed just walking enough to shop for groceries, take out the trash, or getting the mail is a huge challenge, so just going out to walk around and meet people is near impossible. Having zero available disposable income also doesn't help. If I can hold on a couple more months and everything works out I'll be able to switch schools and have more aid options that will take care of my financial and healthcare needs. I'm just trying to hold on and it is so hard.

There is the abbreviated story if you somehow stopped on this post and actually read through everything. If you made it this far, thank you for listening. If you have the time to say happy birthday or say something nice I would really appreciate it. You really don't know how much it would mean to me. No one else is going to tell me today, so you might get to be the only person that wishes me a happy birthday. I don't get any presents or any cake. I don't get a birthday meal or get to do anything cool. I don't get to go anywhere or see anyone. There won't be any birthday cards in the mail or celebratory emails. That's okay though. If one person manages to take the time to read this and let me know there is someone, anyone out there then it'll be alright.

&#x200B;

Edit: Update - Thanks so much to everyone. I barely have any words. Just thank you all so very much. You did bring a grown man to tears, but the best kind.

1682901107.0,Saw someone die yesterday,"Yesterday while I getting on the bus after work , a boy that was getting off stepped into traffic without looking and got hit by a car that sent him flying in front of the bus. It happened so fast that I didn’t even finish paying for my ticket yet. Everyone came up to try and help him until the ambulance got there but the amount of blood and how far the car launched him, I knew he wasn’t going to make it. The EMTs got there, checked his pulse and immediately got him on the stretcher and used the defibrillators. The ambulance rode off. No sirens. No lights. No nothing. I got up and just walked back to my job in total shock. All I could and have been thinking about is the brief couple of seconds where I was able to see him before he died. Looked like a teenager and he looked like he just got off of work himself. I especially remember his long dreadlocs because some of them had ripped out and was laying in the street. Tried to tell my family what I saw and it seemed like no one cared, especially my mom. She seemed more upset that she had to come pick me up while she doing Lyft. After the shock faded I thought I was okay until I tried going to sleep. That entire part of my day kept playing back on loop. Couldn’t sleep so tried watching tv but I couldn’t pay attention to what was going on. Then I started thinking about all the times I’ve stepped into the street without thinking for hours. My body eventually gave out and went to sleep. Woke up feeling like shit so I asked my mom for a ride to work. During the ride she asked me why I looked depressed. Didn’t say anything. Then she asked me if I was able to complete some chore yesterday and when I said no she started going off on me. Telling me that I’m lazy and I don’t care about anything. I got angry and yelled at her and told her imma still fucked up from yesterday and she told me to “toughen up and leave that shit in the past. You didn’t know him “ after that I asked her to just drop me off wherever because I just was sick of her attitude. I eventually got to work but I had to walk past the spot he got hit at. I cried. Couldn’t help it. Felt like a total bitch but I just couldn’t help it. My entire shift was just me mourning a total stranger. I know it’s probably stupid but it’s just how I am.

1618379328.0,We need to stop calling suicide an “impulsive decision”,"Suicide is so much more than just a “spur of the moment”. When a person has been struggling for months, weeks, or years, it’s not impulsive. When a person has a successful and thought through plan, it’s not impulsive. When a person has reached out multiple times, but they aren’t heard, it’s not impulsive. When a person feels like nothing will ever get better, and death is their best option, it is not impulsive. They have carefully picked out each pro and con and thought of nothing but their death for a very long time. It is not impulsive. Suicide is not impulsive because others cannot see their struggle. Outside sources cannot label suicide as “impulsive” when they do not know the severity and dexterity of the persons situation.

^^ In this post I’m talking about every situation being called impulsive, because there very much is situations where it is impulsive, which is not to say that it’s any harder or easier, it’s just different, and a lot of times non impulsive behaviors or situations are labeled as impulsive, and having been on both sides it can be very frustrating. I’m talking about phrases like “a permanent solution for a temporary problem” or being called selfish, because suicide is very different to how it is labeled. For some it is impulsive, and for some it isn’t.",mentalhealth

1586810845.0,I recently read this and I think it might help someone else too: “Always do your best” doesn’t mean “work until you collapse”. If you push yourself past your best abilities you will do worse. Doing your best means knowing your limits and working within them.,It’s not the literal thing I read but something along those lines and I actually had an “OH” moment that I have extremely rarely. I never realized that I misheard doing my best as I should push myself to be *the* best. But how good you are at something is on a bell curve and if you strive past “your best” you will become worse.

1591478215.0,Stop telling boys that they shouldn't cry.,"When I was around 10 years old, I watched my teenage brother nurse a wound. He was crying as he soaked his scraped knee with water in the bathtub.

I looked at him with disdain. ""Why are you crying?"" I asked in annoyance. I didn't realize it then, but my visceral reaction to his emotional vulnerability reflected something that I had been taught earlier in my childhood: boys aren't supposed to cry. 

When I became a young adult, I had a lot of trouble expressing my emotions. I put on a smile for everyone I saw, and avoided talking about anything that would trigger an emotional reaction. When my emotions built up to the point where I couldn’t control them, I would explode. It took a long time to learn how to share my feelings - something that people still consider to be a sign of weakness in men.

I think I’m one of the millions of men out there who’ve been told, at some point in their lives, to repress their emotions. I now understand how emotional repression can lead to a variety of complications in mental health. I wrote a song to challenge the idea that men shouldn’t show their feelings simply because they are men. Listen link below.

For all the guys out there listening to this song - be vulnerable. Feel your emotions. Share with others how you feel. I think that’s even more manly than being a tough guy.

1618791328.0,Two weeks ago I was almost homeless. Now I got a job and a place to stay and my mental health seems to be improving a lot,"I think is important to share some positive news as well since sometimes we just come here in our lowest times, and I shared here previously when I thought I was at one of the direst moments of my life.

It has been two weeks, I was basically out of money in a new city, have searched everywhere for a job but couldn't find any, so I decided to go to the social services center at the town hall to see if they could help me anyway. Shared with the staff my story and how I was going to be homeless that same day, but since it is a small city, the social worker contacted a friend of hers that owned a place that was looking for a woman to cook, clean and receive guests at a private tourist attraction.  

Although I'm male, she decided to give me a chance, and so it has been two weeks of hard work but everything is working out so far. I actually like the job a lot, and my employer seems to be quite happy with my performance and already increased my salary from past week. 

My anxiety and depression are way under control now.

After a split second of worrying I may be stepping into a domestic violence and, thus, dangerous situation, I knew I needed to help either way. So I ran up and said I could help. That's when I realized she was holding a non-responsive, not breathing baby. Time slowed down. I stashed my dog inside her front door, took the baby, and narrated each step of heimlich, sweeping the mouth, etc. I was eerily calm. And the baby started crying! I had to do it a second time when she stopped breathing again. Meanwhile, the woman who was her grandmother was on the phone with 911 and, understandably, in such a panic. The police came first, because neighbors called about the screaming. Then the ambulance a bit after that and a good 5-10 minutes after I got there. I feel so so lucky I happened to be there and somehow remembered lifeguard training from 15 years ago. And I feel humbled in like a pre-social media definition of it.

I don’t have weapons or drugs that could easily kill me, I am not alone, so I will be okay. I’ll try to focus on spending time with myself tomorrow and do something to make myself feel better.

I woke up this morning with an unshakable feeling that today would be the day I finally commit suicide. I figured I could throw myself in front of a train. I said goodbye to my boyfriend and told him I love him. 
I ended up not doing that because I had professional obligations and made promises. By the time it was over, my colleague offered to drive me home so I wouldn’t take the train. So, I got home safe and was able to snap out of it. 
It feels like a bad dream and now I just want to lay down and go to sleep. 
I’ve been feeling horribly inferior to everyone around me. I’m not intelligent, I don’t have any special skills, and I really believe nothing will be lost if I died. I feel as if I should just accept my inherent worthlessness and just save everyone the trouble of me breathing their air. 

I don’t want to reach out to people who know me because I don’t want to worry them. And I certainly don’t want them thinking I’m just looking for attention or validation.

I had this grand plan when I left highschool. I wanted to study outside of the US. It was really difficult to find a way to do it, but I had a dream and I was so determined to accomplish it. But depression hit me bad and I almost didn't graduate highschool, my parents didn't support me and I wasn't able to go to college because of it so I was forced to take a gap year. I broke my foot and was bed ridden for 6 months and became very depressed. Finally got to uni and failed the first year. Just failed my 2nd.

this was just a vent because it hurts seeing him live life happy and free of consequences. I've been through the legal system and they didn't do shit. I'm furious to see him succeed because he doesn't deserve to succeed. I am a victim of something horrible. I am angry and hurt and I'm allowed to be.

I unblocked him to do my yearly ""stay the fuck away from me"" search. he's got a good 250k on TikTok, and all I could feel was anger. he's a rapist and an emotional manipulator and he's a horrible person, and he has all this support behind him. it makes me sick to my stomach. 

I'm not strong enough mentally to actually speak up about what he's done and in Australia you can get sued.

Let me fucking tell you something. I am so sick and tired of hearing people say that suicide is selfish. You want to know what's fucking selfish? Expecting someone else to live for you. Expecting someone to put their own personal pain to the side for your fucking happiness. Expecting your relationship or companionship to be that saving grace to pull anyone through a deep depression. THAT is the epitomy of selfish. It is no one's responsibility to do anything that makes other people happy or comfortable. You are not owed any of that. You don't get to tell someone who's suicidal that they're selfish for considering it and that they should think about others egos before their suffering. You don't get to call someone selfish after they commit suicide because they didn't think about everyone else's feelings when they obviously couldn't even handle their own. On top of the fact that it's disrespectful to speak ill of the dead. How selfish do you have to be to have the audacity to call someone selfish when you are the one who wants a dangerously depressed person to continue suffering just so you can continue to ignore all the symptoms but hand them a god damn gold start sticker for being alive like it fucking helps anything? And before you even bring religion into the conversation, news flash, Not everyone believes in your God so telling someone ""God doesn't make mistakes"", ""Suicide is a sin"", ""God only gives us what we can handle"", or some other idiotic bullshit, doesn't bring everyone comfort and sometimes it makes things worse. And that's not your opportunity to tell them all the ways they need to find God. Because again: Not. Everyone. Believes. In. Your. Fucking. God. End of. Telling a suicidal person that wanting to end their pain is selfish will only tell them that they cannot confide in you and it marks you as an unreliable support system. It will more than likely make them pull away from you and make them feel even more isolated. YOU'RE NOT HELPING! And don't use the excuses ""I've been through worse and I don't want to kill myself"" or ""Other people have it worse"" because you obviously don't understand what mental illness is. Being depressed about a situation is so much different than being clinically depressed. Situational depression lasts through a particular struggle. Clinical depression is being sad for almost no god damn reason. Don't compare the two because you're only making yourself look like more of an asshole.

I was 19, heartbroken, homesick, lost, and very confused. I remember the sharp air that rushed in the room when I opened the window that very cold and snowy February night. It felt like little needles on my skin; a stark contrast to the hot, salty tears streaming down my face. I was in trouble for drinking on campus...again.  However, the drinking wasn’t just purely fun and games. I was using it to cope with a lot of uncertainty and hopelessness. My on again off again boyfriend told me he was dating someone else. He lived with my best guy friend at the time so a lot of “sides” were taken in the whole mess. And somewhere along the way my roommate moved out. I was alone. 

I spent the remainder of the week at the hospital under psychiatric care. The days I spent there blur together now. I was in such a haze of numbness. 
My entire life was uprooted. I got kicked out of college and I had to start over somewhere new. The next several years were spent kicking my ass into gear to show myself and the friends who abandoned me that they didn’t get the best of me. I pushed and pushed myself. I started looking forward and not backward. I learned to love myself again. Slowly. Very slowly. 

I graduated from a new (and better) college with honors two years later. I took a chance and bought a one way ticket to NYC and began living the life I used to only be able to dream about.

10 years later, I am living proof that things get better. Depression and anxiety are challenges I still deal with occasionally, but now I know how to handle it. 

Right now I’m sitting in the house I just bought all by myself. I’m reminiscing about the years I spent living and working in Manhattan, where I had an incredible job and amazing friends. Most days, my life felt like a happy movie. I recently decided to re-locate, slow things down and enjoy the present. Now I’m in the process of renovating my house from the inside out. I volunteer with an organization that raises funds for underprivileged women and children. I carve out time for my hobbies, friends, and loved ones. I’ve truly become a better person. I can now enjoy a glass or two of wine without overdoing it just to cope. I can take a deep breath, a small sip, and appreciate how far I’ve come.

I still have a long way to go. I’m still a work in progress. I haven’t found love yet but I look forward to the day I do. In the meantime, you can catch me cultivating my new herb garden and reading a good book or two. 

If you’re going through what I went through 10 years ago, my best advice is to hang on, know it does get better (and no this isn’t something that people just say. It’s true). You’re not alone. You’re loved. And you’re stronger than you think.
Take a deep breath, be thankful that you are able to do so, and repeat until you truly believe better days are around the corner.

TLDR - I’m 10 years post-suicide attempt and better than ever. I wanted to share my accomplishment with you all and hope this story might help someone.",mentalhealth

1638625610.0,"How I became a happier and kinder person, and accidently started liking myself a lot more","I did a random experiment on myself a few years ago. I did not read about this anywhere, I just thought of it and decided to try it.


I forced myself to think nice thoughts about every stranger I see. When I see someone on the street, I think of something nice about that person. Like ""their hair look so good"", ""what a nice smile"", ""those legs are great"" etc. In the beginning it was hard. Like, the first thought that popped up was something mean, but then I followed it up to find something good about the person.


If I don't find anything nice to think about their appearances (it happens), I don't force it, instead I make a nice assumption about them. I think ""she probably has a great sense of humour"", ""he is probably a great dad"", ""this person could be very creative"" etc. Just whatever pops up, and the great part is, it doesn't matter if it's true or not. I just form a nice assumption in my mind. 


In the beginning I had to consciously make the decision to think something nice. After a while it started automatically happen. It's been years, but now every time I go out I think mostly kind thoughts about people. This lead me to think more nice thoughts about myself. When I see myself in a mirror, I'm no longer trained to search for flaws, I automatically think nice things about myself aswell. I'm a much more confident person due to this.


If you want to try this, I recommend starting with strangers. When that becomes natural, apply it to everyone. Your classmates, your colleagues, your friends. Force yourself to focus on the positives. If you think something negative of someone, thats perfectly okay, but follow it up with something nice. Now I have an easier time giving people spontaneous and genuine compliments, because that's how my mind works. I'm a lot happier and calmer around people when I think kind thoughts about everyone. And this is not something that happened naturally, I had to train myself to do this, and it worked!

I want to add, that I've had some friends that were the opposite. The kind that thinks it's fun to roast everyone they see and say mean things about strangers or acquaintances. I talked to them about this, talked to them about how I'm changing my mindset and asked them to not behave like this around me. Some changed, some I am no longer friends with. Not a big loss, in hindsight. People that act like that was a negative influence in my life anyway. 


If you try this, good luck, and please let me know how it goes for you :) It will probably feel super weird and silly in the beginning, but try to stick with it for a while and see what happens to your thought patterns!",mentalhealth
1609997732.0,"Has anyone else lost ""friends"" that made it seem like your mental illness was a bigger inconvenience for them than it was for you?","I use the word ""friends"" loosely, because they no longer hold that title.

I went through a pretty rough phase of about six months. My depression and anxiety were at an all-time high. I won't go into all the details, but I just needed someone to be there for me.

I was told, by two friends of 10+ years, that my depression was ""too much,"" and that they ""couldn't handle it."" They told me that I needed to ""own up to my actions"" (being depressed, I guess???). Then, they just deleted me from everything and stopped talking to me. Some friends, eh?

Still makes me sick to this day. But perhaps, it's better to be rid of those people.

Don't get me wrong, I know it can be difficult when your friends don't have their shit together. But isn't that what friends are for? To support you and be there for you when you're in a dark place?

1590025748.0,My suicidal thoughts and depression.,"If you're reading this can you please upvote it so others can see, thanks for reading this as well it just helps me I guess.

My names Jack, I'm 15 years old, bi (not come out to anyone), have dandruff, acne, pretty fucking ugly all things considered... And severe anxiety and depression.

I was living great until last June. At the time I had 2 best mates, who I'll refer to as M (funny, kind but not entirely good to talk about mental health and touchy feelings) and K (kindest person ever, used to be able to speak about anything to, but mentally isn't great). K had severe mental health issues and was not listening to anybodys advice about seeking help. Eventually I asked M if I should confront her about it, he agreed, I did it because my other friend who I'll refer to as J (narsasistic, arrogant, but has a soft side occasionally) had been telling me for months she was an attention seeker. I figured she'd take it alright but I was wrong. She trusted me more than anyone (her words) and it was the worst thing anyone had apparently told her.

It bothered me alot and I kept trying to make ammends because I felt TERRIBLE.

I was relatively stable in the grand scheme tho.

2 months pass and August aka summer holidays hits! Worst month and a half ever. J had somehow convinced M I was basically a backstabbing, lying piece of shit and essentially the worst person ever.

We argued back and forth for a while. We fell out hard to say the least.

It broke my heart losing both M and K (I guess J) in such a short time and the misery started to sink in.

HOPE WASN'T LOST. I had 2 friends left B (kind, nice to talk with, quiet) and Z (think J but a geek gamer and a textbook bully) I had a plan to get M K and J face to face (all previous stuff was done by text). Z was on holiday. So I tried asking B to get them together, he said to wait until school but I insisted as K didn't go to our school. I accepted tho. However (according to what I've been told) B lied I think and told Z I had manipulated him into trying to get them all together. Z bullied the shit out of me.

This is where I think my depression sunk in, I couldn't think properly, lashed out in anger out everyone, was bored of gaming, etc. Moral of the story, I wanted to put a bullet in my head!

September hit and school started (year 10). Depressed anxious and suicidal my studies went down and thus my grades.

Then my parents split, IT SUCKED. My father isn't exactly great, he can be abusiveish at times.

Everything started to get worse and I ran away several times, and dragged a knife across my arm alot.

I started to sit in the library for most of the day and still did until corona. Got sent work and it definitely helped with my anxiety as I was bullied and a laughing stock in year 9. Pretty badly. So being out of lessons was alright.

I started seeing the school councillor which helped to have someone to talk to. 

In December the school had no choice but to take me to arrow park hospital as I had massive scars across my chest from self harm. I stayed overnight and my parents ended up kinda talking things out.

I had to go to therapy to say the least. I was still on the edge of suicide.

Started the 8 week course this January and it was alright. Helped keep me positive. 
J and Z made me want to die more as they constantly reminded me of what I am, a monster. Told me I was worthless, should just do it and brought up my Instagram stories (I used to post on them suicidal stuff as a cry for help but was just accused of attention seeking). Worse too. 

Throughout the next 2 months I still stayed mostly the same. Suicidal, depressed, anxious, most importantly lonely. Me and M eventually worked things out because I actually put the effort in a lot over several months begging him and K to help me and how sorry I was. They didn't really want to be my friend. K and I are currently on OK terms I think, imma take it slow with her. M and I talk a lot now.

But... I still feel lonely, have to hide how I feel now. Don't really have anyone to talk about this stuff to. Anymore at least. I still hate my life. Want to die. Does make me wonder if I'm actually really liked by anyone.

But how would I describe myself? Gamer (mk11, overwatch, paladins and smash), want to do well but knows I can't, socially awkward on 1 to 1s, try to be funny, nice to people who I care for and are nice to me, would die for my closest friends. But I'm lonely ultimately, depressed, can't ride a bike, swim, fear of driving etc.

It really does feel like what I imagine abstaining from alcohol or drugs feels like, but instead of that, your abstaining from bad choices. For example, can’t stay out with friends because if I don’t have a regular sleep routine, it will drastically effect my mood. Can’t drink a lot of caffeine because it will effect my sleep schedule and my mood. Can’t drink alcohol because with messes with my medication and my mood. Can’t think those negative thoughts or otherwise I will spiral. Can’t stay in bed all morning, or otherwise you’ll stay in bed all day or even several days.

Edit: oh wow! I did not expect this to get any comments or votes. I have suffered depression for over a decade, staring in my teen years. I did not get the help that I needed until recently, and therefore developed many bad habits to try and cope with it.

1552829913.0,"If you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts, this the wisdom I’ve gathered since my suicide attempt a decade ago.","First and foremost you need some rest. I would say that 10/10 times when I have suicidal ideation it’s also when I am over tired or over worked.

Secondly there are people in your life that genuinely care enough to force you into help. I know it’s scary to reach out to them and admit that you are having a hard time alone but I whole heartedly recommend it. I would not be alive to type this if it weren’t for the wonderful people in my support network. One method my friend and I came up with is that I can kill myself, I just have to get his permission first. This gives me the benefit of having the “option” but also puts the social pressure on me to never do it. 

I know you might think no one gives a shit, but the same people who would be devastated if you died would probably prefer to help you out before it gets to that point. There is something socially validating about suicide in the brain of the suicidal. It feels easier than to admit you are having a hard time. You feel like people will take what you are going through seriously. But plain and simple you will not be around to enjoy that validation because you will be dead. And all the people who would have helped you will be asking what they could have done. Instead of leaving the people you love on this Earth with the trauma of dealing with your death, please reach out to them.

Lastly what you have gone through is not easy. You may feel exhausted, defeated or even angry at others. Self reflection might be productive but you are right to feel angry at how they treated you. What you do with that anger is your responsibility now and it seems like you are just letting it eat away at you. Maybe there is some way to can transfer that anger into productivity or artistic expression. Who knows?

You have real problems. They suck, you’re totally right to feel that way. You should feel no blame that shitty things happen to you. But these problems are still your responsibility. And there are people out there who can help. Again I would not be alive today if it wasn’t for the friend I mentioned above and a wonderful therapist who came in at the right time. You may not have luck the first few times; my first therapist sent me into a mental breakdown. But I promise you that you will find the right fit if you keep trying.

Focus on the problems that you can solve. I think about the serenity prayer they say in AA every day. “Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference”. There are many issues in your life you may not have control over, but there are some that you do. Focus on those. Try to define them as precisely as possible. Don’t say “everybody hates me”. Say “everybody hates me when I ______”. The first is a cry of defeat. The second gives you a concrete area of yourself that you can improve. I always tell my friend “if you are going to hate yourself, at least be more specific”.

There is so much in life worth living for. A beautiful sunrise, your daughter’s graduation some day. Hell even if it’s just a new season of a tv show you love. The future is a mystery, and that’s a good thing. It means that everything is going to change. If things are good they are going to get worse. But that also means if things are bad they are going to get better. Take solace in that during the bad times and prepare yourself what things feel like they are going too well.

Don’t hesitate to dm me if there is anything I can help you with. We’re all on this crazy ride together.

God bless.

Thank you to everyone who shared their stories or sent their kind words. 

I hope that this post does not glamorize suicide attempts in any way. Yes I tried, but that doesn’t delegitimize the suffering of someone who hasn’t. Just because you haven’t attempted doesn’t make your situation any less valid or serious compared to anyone else’s. Remember my words above: a suicidal persons warped sense of reality tells them that suicide is a better option than reaching out for help. It is not. Ever.

Many of you have reached out to me in a PM and I thank you for reaching out to someone. I am always a friend in need to someone but I am not a professional. There are REAL professionals out there making a difference just waiting to be the change you need in your life. Remember the best thing you can do is reach out.

And you can't predict who will pull through whatever, or who will be lost to whatever. And there's no way to really know what happens when we die. 

In all honesty, that thought brings me comfort. I dont think im a bad person. Sure, ive done shitty things, im human, like you (I assume). But this mindset is what has gotten me through some rough shit. 

2019 Is my worst year to date. August 24, a good friend who I really looked up to, committed suicide. I credit him to be a big part in preventing my own suicide. Then in November a great uncle and a high school classmate, both i was very fond of, passed within a couple days of each other. Then December 10, my grandma passed after a stroke the week prior. Her husband, my grandpa passed in May 2020. 

That was a bad time, as you can imagine. I had never lost anyone I was ever close to before then. My friends suicide being the big thing im still struggling with today. But whenever I have a beer, or some liquor, I pour one out in his/their name. 

I like to imagine my friend in Valhalla. As of all the afterlives that I know of, thats where he belongs. As he is a fucking legend. He lost his battle with depression, but he fought fucking hard. I still laugh and smile at the thought of him in any afterlife yelling at whoever is in charge because they don't understand the rules of whatever afterlife Pathfinder game he's running. 

And I like to think that wherever he, my grandparents, my old high school buddy, and my great uncle may be. When I pour one out, a beautiful mug full of that liquid is presented to them. 

Which that thought is made better by the fact that often times, im drinking really shitty cheap booze. And they look up from wherever they are and are just kinda ""what the fuck? You pour one out in mourning and im stuck with your shitty 1 dollar beer?"" 

I dont know, just a thought that may help someone in mourning. Hang in there, stranger. No matter how shitty life gets, it will always get better.  And despite the fact that life will get shitty again at some point, it WILL get better again. 

Hang in there.",mentalhealth
1623829504.0,New job! Still homeless but I got a new job! Mental health is on the uptick!,"I am so fucking excited.   


Story time.   


Before Covid hit I was a leasing agent for a large Canadian REIT.  I was important, I was valued, I was paid very well. I had everything I wanted. I was fortunate enough to be sent to Calgary to launch one of the largest private student housing projects in Canadian history. Was a big big deal in the industry. Then Covid came along and decimated the Student housing industry. 50% of our clients were international and of the remaining 50% being domestic, only a small fraction of those were 'locally domestic' You can imagine what losing 90% of your paying clients can do for a project.  


I lost my job and came home defeated. My mental health suffered. My physical health suffered. My relationship suffered. I wasn't working, I wasn't a partner anymore. My girl left me in Dec.   


Things were hard. I was alone, I'm very much an introvert. The only people I talk to are people via Reddit or random women on dating apps. There's nobody I could call to come over and hang out with. Nobody I could call if I was having a dark moment. And there were many dark moments let me tell you.   


Winter blues is a thing. I'm a huge believer in that. I was living in a basement apartment that my ex and I shared before she left. I was so immobile emotionally and physically that for 5 months after she left I couldn't bring myself to removing anything she left behind. She took the cats, but the cat food sat in its dish for months. Her clothes still hung in the closet the way she left them. Every day was a dark dank lonely sad existence. I knew I needed a change. I had to change my outlook, my direction, my goals.   


I started talking to people on dating apps. I had no intention of seeing anyone. I just needed to talk to people again. That helped. I also started being more active on Reddit, that helped too. I like talking with people, I like giving advice. Small uptick in mental health after this.   
Then the sun started coming out. The grey dirty snow started going away. It was the end of April. Forced myself to go outside, even for a minute. Even for that very short walk to get milk. Instead of ordering it I went and got it. Small uptick in mental health after this.   
I got closure with my ex. Finally. Small uptick here.   


I needed something drastic though.   


So, voluntary homelessness. I left my apartment. I rented a room, and when that went to shit I started living out of my car. Waking up in the bush, next to a river, down by the ocean did wonders. Not caring or worrying about anything. Nothing at all, just being entirely selfish in my needs, my mental health. Huge uptick. I started smiling again. I started feeling better about everything. 

&#x200B;

Was going to spend the entire summer living outta my car. Then one random night I applied for a building manager job. Its become so much more than that.   


I was just given a job offer for a leasing agent role AND a building manager role. For a smaller REIT, but this position will require me to be very mobile. I could be driving 3hrs away to one of our buildings. I will never sit in an office. The company car is my office.   


Its going to be a couple weeks before I can afford an apartment, or I might just continue to live out of my car. Which may be tough because I'll also have a company car. So we'll see what happens there.   


But huge huge uptick. Motivation is high. Excitement is high. Self worth is high. I'm valued again. They were hugely impressed with my skill set, and its feels so damn good to be valued again.   


I wanted to share this because I've said to 100s of people on this very same sub that things can change, but you need to be the catalyst for that change. Nobody is going to come along and place change at your feet. You are responsible for everything that happens in your life, regardless of what has happened in your life. Wake up tomorrow, forge forward, make a small change in your life and allow it to snowball.   


Things are on an uptick now, but things dont get any easier. With this uptick comes a tremendous amount of responsibility. People are invested in me. This motivates me. I'll wake up tomorrow for my first day with a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm but will have to know and understand that a downtick can come at anytime. I'll deal with those when they come, I'm not going to worry about something that hasn't happened yet.   


Forward progress. Be the catalyst for change and personal growth. Have your pity party. Be sad. Have regret. But you gotta get over it, you gotta find closure and move on because the world will continue to spin without you. May aswell spin with it amirite?",mentalhealth
1612262165.0,I dont want to kill myself but I don't want to be alive either. It feels like I'm being forced to suffer and the only things that make me happy are just distractions from getting better.,"I fucking hate myself and everyone around me. I hate my mother, my dad and my brother. I hate my best friend. I hate my fucked up body and being alive is just morbid and disgusting. My mum is refusing to take proper care of my pets which I now have 5 of because she wanted more and will probably try to get more. I do the best I can but she still fucking overfeeds them so my two new kittens are going to be overweight and sick like the rest of my animals. 

If I show any sign of disagreement which is basically fucking impossible because she will literally say ""look how fat theyre getting isnt it cute"" and I cant help but look miserable or telling her that what shes doing is wrong. She will threaten to kick me out to move in with my dad which she has done multiple times before. I cant stay there because the whole house is covered in mould and I have breathing issues because Ive been smoking cigarettes, weed, heroin, pills, suboxone and tons of other crap since I was 12 years old. My breathing is so fucked I am constantly aware of my lungs and just breathing fresh air makes me feel so disgusted to be alive. I have an infection in my mouth and another in my sinus, which I basically have permanently because of the fucked up structure of my face.

Im not taking drugs anymore but I still smoke a cigarette every few days and I am so guilty because no matter how hard I seem to try, I cant even take care of myself. 

I live in fucking sydney where the house and rent prices are so fucked even if could find a trade or work I wouldnt be able to move out. The only person I had that understood and was there with me through all this shit was raped and murdered almost two years. He was my best fucking friend, the only person my age that I had been friends with in 6 years. My other best and only friend is addicted to fucking heroin and has aspergers so he just jumps to conclusions and gets mad at me if I show him any sort of emotion about things that are going on in my life, he just thinks im weak. I stopped seeing him because hes a horrible fucking influence. but I end up visiting him every week because i want social contact, but I just end up regretting it and leaving his house after an hour.

Ive recently been diagnosed with fucking epilepsy so thats fun. I have seizures when I dont get enough sleep, and I cant because my mum is fucking yelling or if im at my dads house he is up all night singing and working. Literally all night he sleeps from 6 am to 4 pm. So im constantly worried about having a siezure and I try so hard to get good sleep. So recently my sleeps been good enough that I dont think im at seizure risk, but still bad enough that my health is on a strong and steady decline. 

My brother doesnt talk to me, hes becoming an alcoholic. I mean hes been drinking everyday for the past year, but atleast hes stopped stealing off me and doesnt threaten to beat me up everytime I make eye contact with him anymore. 

I really dont want to kill myself but I have felt so bad my whole life and I cant seem to turn it around that I think if it keeps going it will be the only reasonable option. This is fucking bullshit. Why the fuck are the people around my happy. They are all fucking kidding themselves and need to just accept the fact there lives fucking suck so maybe they might actually do something to help themselves and inturn the people that care about them.

I hate everyone I care about and it makes me so fucking angry. I cant ever express this anger to everyone I love thats hurting me because they just seem to treat me worse.",mentalhealth

From then on, my next appointment is a month and a half away. Out of all the things to make people wait for, this is probably one of if not the WORST. Does the government or anyone with any position of power understand the consequences of making people who are trying to get their mental health examined wait long periods of time? More funding needs to be put into this. (also I wish society was less toxic and 'edgy' towards each other but I digress)

I myself am doing okay but I can't imagine the pain others go through when they're told that they have to wait several weeks or even months to get their next appointment and how agonizing it can be.

1617639418.0,I found a suicide note my bf wrote last night and I don’t know what to do,"I’ve been worried about my bf. We’ve been together for almost 11 years now. I monitor his search history because he doesn’t share his true feelings so this is how I know what he’s feeling. I went through his searches this morning and noticed him searching last night for “painless and effective methods of suicide” among other things. I went through his phone and found a suicide message written in it. 

I’ve found them before but always months after the fact. The last time he wrote something it was an update saying he was still standing and things were looking up. But this time it was a goodbye note. And that everything he thought was looking up was just a delusion. 

He was sleeping when I left for work today. I don’t know what to do. He wrote the note right before he went to bed. If I admit I looked he’ll be even more secretive in the future and then I just won’t know it’s happening (he’s so good at hiding it, the only way I know is by looking at his search history and he can easily make it incognito in the future if he’s aware). 

I’ve tried getting him to go to therapy and he doesn’t want to. 

I don’t know what to do.

And i recieved a phonecall letting me know that i will be recieving free daycare today aswell.

1585579429.0,I called a suicide hotline recently and was dismissed because I’m a man and I have Tourette’s. 💦🦄😖,"I looked the # up on Google cause I was feeling unstable with signs of psychosis. I know these symptoms well enough after years of dealing with my illness.  I forced myself to remain calm so I could clearly communicate my situation. The woman (her name was Rachel)  speaking with was clearly overwhelmed by how many calls they’ve been getting.  When I told her I was having a mental health crisis she took me seriously enough, but then my verbal tics started.  I could tell that my tics were scaring her so I told her “I’m safe, I just have Tourettes”.  Then I heard the dreaded word come out of my mouth....cunt.  It was clearly a tic, but Rachel’s reaction was to tell me I couldn’t talk to her that way. Her tone went from scared shitless to anger. That was when I knew that there is not going to be any help for me. At least not from a woman.  I realized then that I wasn’t going to be able to get reliable help and to just get off the phone. To be honest, it kinda ramped up my paranoia also. 

Before I got off the phone I calmed myself and quietly told her, “YOU are a mental health professional who has trained for this. When a person experiencing a mental health crisis calls you and uses a word YOU find offensive you need to remember that YOU’RE feelings at that moment are minuscule compared to the pain the person on the other end is going through. Please think about this because you’re hurting some people more than you’re helping them”. 


I am so angry about this. I did everything right. I know from experience how broken our mental health system is, but this really hits a new low.  I took extensive notes because it seemed important and am really tempted to get that woman fired from her job for being so unprofessional, but frankly I’m worried I’ll get a woman on the line in HR and will again be dismissed because of sexism. From now on I will ask for and only speak with men when calling the Suicide Hotline(s).   

One thing I know for sure, I am not calling 911 for a trip to the psych ward anytime soon. If the mental health system is in this much crisis just over the phone imagine how bad it’s falling apart face to face.

1565027989.0,I got an apology from my old psychiatrist,"When I was 13 (around the early 2000s) my parents got worried as I was making the transition from elementary school to middle school. They had me see a psychiatrist who did no testing or talking with me before writing me a prescription for some SSRIs. The dosage was very high and my parents weren't told to taper me on or off. 


I had intense sleepiness, trouble caring about things, trouble remembering my friends' names. I slept so deeply that I didn't even wake up to my body's signals to use the bathroom; I was a teenaged boy pissing his own bed. My grades plummeted and that made my parents simply insist on higher doses. The psychiatrist I was seeing wrote those prescriptions too, still never looked me in the eye. 


I knew something was wrong, but it was months before I could focus enough to tell my parents. Luckily they listened and I never had to take those pills again. But for the next 18 years I went through life blaming myself for not adjusting to a new school quickly enough or well enough. When I was old enough to make my own appointments, I spent hours and hours (and hundreds of dollars) getting evaluated for every possible mental illness. I even had blood tests. All the tests came back saying I was normal and healthy, but it still tugged at me. 


A few weeks ago I found the courage to find that psychiatrist and then I wrote him a letter asking for an apology. I was respectful, stating the facts of the matter first and then moving on to how it made me feel in the years afterward. I was clear that I only wanted an apology, but didn't want to smear his reputation or harm him. I told him that he could reply or he could not, and if he didn't reply I wouldn't bother him further. 


Today he found me via Facebook and apologized. The relief and the confirmation I felt was nearly overwhelming.

1561349181.0,Why isn’t there a such thing as an urgent care designed specifically for mental health emergencies?,"Why do emergency rooms exist for physical or extreme mental concerns but there is no such thing as a walk-in urgent mental health clinic?

I’ve wondered this for years. I’ve always had a panic disorder. During my first terrible panic attack at 21, I remember googling different mental health facilities in the area and limited info came up. I ended up calling the cops because I was afraid and felt like I couldn’t breathe, but knew it was psychological. The cops showed up and the only assistance they provided was suggesting that I sat in the back seat of their car. I felt ashamed sitting there, and as my panic dissipated, I just remember feeling hollow and empty. They couldn’t help me and unless I was truly a danger to myself or others, they weren’t going to commit me to any psych wards. So, they left and told me some “mobile counselors” would be on the way.

Eventually, I went back home and sat alone for 3 hours, trying to relax. These “mobile” counselors the cops said they would provide me with decided to give me a call and ask if I still wanted help. By that time I was fatigued, so I declined.

That’s when I came up with this question. At that moment I would’ve loved to just walk into a place and talk to a counselor on-call. Not days or weeks of waiting to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist, nor being committed to a psych ward. Just real people with crises that they need help with.

Helplines, in my personal opinion, aren’t the same type of treatment. I’ve only tried a couple though, so I’m not entirely certain on it. Though, in some cases, slight medication intervention might be necessary, and personally I prefer a face-to-face conversation.

To the brain, anything that is traumatic, or causes hurt or pain, is trauma.  


There is no gauge to say how severe a trauma is.  


Don't invalidate your trauma just because you think that it is not as severe as someone else's trauma. It doesn't work like that.  


All trauma is valid. All trauma is trauma.  


There are so many different types of trauma.  


Emotional neglect with a parent working too much during your childhood.  
Physically abused by a parent.  


Both examples above are trauma to the brain.  


But .. regardless of the trauma, you are not broken. You deserve the same amount of love, joy and happiness as everyone else. And you can get it.  


Stop telling yourself that you are not whole, that you're not worthy and drserving. Tell yourself the opposite and maybe you start to finally believe it.  


Maybe you were emotionally abused or physically abused .. and you have been telling yourself every since that you don't deserve love and affection. And now? .. you believe it right? This is your story. Well, change the story. Identify the story that you've been telling yourself, find the lies in the story .. and make up a new one, a truthful one.

1614270626.0,The power of walking,"  

..I saw somewhere on reddit, an advice on going for walks when feeling down.

After a breakup in late January, being a couch potato in the beginning, where I have been feeling like my lowest ever. Feeling sad, depressed, lonely and hurt like hell. While at the same time, going nuts from working from home, and not seeing anyone. Fuck this pandemic, right??! 

I decided, 13-14th Feb-ish to just go for a short walk, every day. Because… fuck it what else is there to do.

I usually walked 20-30 minutes each day at first. Then the last 4-5 days I walked around hour. First it was just a nice break from being stuck indoor. But I have started feeling happier ever since I started walking. I don’t feel like giving up on life as much as I did not long ago. I even feel like smiling to strangers on my walk now... Yeah, I’m weird like that.

But today I walked 13km!! (8Miles, I think) my feet hurt, but I feel amazing, and kind of proud I did it. Also, I really need to get some wireless headphones… wanted to chew that wire to pieces several times today. I still feel lonely, and missing my ex. But one day at a time, I guess.

1612694716.0,Tonight we sat and cried together. I forgot I had the power to help people even when I’m sad. Words aren’t always necessary.,"In my family we don’t talk much.

Tonight was a rough night. As per usual I was sat alone in my crying and melting into my mattress. When my mom came in I didn’t bother looking up at her and just growled a classic’ go away’ in response. 

She asked to borrow one of my books and I peeled myself off my bed to grab it. It was only when I went to tell her to leave did I actually bother to look at her. She looked like she had blown her noise a few times and her eyes were watery. This was maybe the second or third time in my entire life I’d seen this happen and I forgot how shellshocking it was to see your numbed parent like that. 

This lead to a short uncomfortable conversation of me asking if she was okay. We didn’t talk much. Instead I just asked her if she wanted to sit on the couch with me and watch a movie. I got her a blanket and some tissues. The whole movie we just sat there, at first crying and just holding hands by the end.

I still don’t know what happened to make her so sad. She knew better than to dig into my pile of mental issues. But when the movie was over she hugged me and said “thank you. this is the happiest I’ve been in a while. I needed this.” 

It really took me out of my own bullshit for a moment to realize I had done something good just by being there. And she had done the same for me in a way. I could tell we just both felt cared for by the end and in my house that goes a long way. 

Don’t forget how powerful small things are. Or that the people around you are often suffering too. You don’t need to be in perfect or even good shape to be the support someone needs.

In my opinion, I think with the amount of people in the world that struggle with some type of mental illness, kids should start learning about them at a much younger age so that their world doesn't fall apart one day and they have no idea why or how to deal with it. So many people are also too afraid to ask for help because they are embarrassed, scared of being judged, or don't have the money/resources for help.

1600884732.0,Last month I attempted suicide for the 4th time. Today I was promoted a week into my new job. It does get better.,"I have struggled with mental illness my entire life. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as a child, depression at 14, ADHD at 16, and bipolar disorder at 20. The first time I seriously considered suicide was when I was 10. Needless to say, it’s been rough.

The pandemic hit me especially hard. In June I quit my job of 6 years due to the effect it was having on my mental health. I was supposed to work at a summer camp in July anyways, but the governor decided the day before I was supposed to start that residential camps would not be running this year. Due to me quitting my previous job I wasn’t eligible for unemployment, so I was no longer able to afford a therapist or my medication.

I found a new job in July but my mental health had declined to the point where I was completely unable to do it. It also involved driving to a different facility every day, which would cause me to vomit with anxiety before every shift. After having a panic attack over parking in Boston, I ghosted them and decided that this was the end for me. I couldn’t do something as simple as sit and stare at a pool for 8 hours, even if the alternative was an empty bank account and a rising self-hatred. How would I ever be able to function independently?

That night I attempted to hang myself. Obviously, it didn’t work, and I’m still here. This frustrated me; I felt like such a failure that I couldn’t even succeed in dying. I ended up relapsing with self harm, and I spent the weeks after that consuming any substance I could get my hands on to numb the pain, waiting for the courage to try again.

After the very much warranted disappointment from my parents, I ended up applying for an overnight warehouse job for an online retailer. From the rumors I’d heard I expected it to suck, but they were right, I needed a job.

They hired me, and I started last week. Turns out it doesn’t suck. And I don’t suck at the job either. Within three days they asked me to apply for a promotion, and today I got a fancy new vest, my shift differential was bumped up by $1.50, and I finally have some hope for the future. I also found out if I stay for a year they can help pay for my education, so for the first time in forever I have a long-term plan for my future. Best of all, I can afford to get help again.

I know I’m going to feel shitty again, but it’s going to get better again after that. I have trouble remembering times like these when I’m really going through it, but for the first time in years I feel capable. I feel like I can take it. I’m a hard worker and I’m no quitter, why would I give up on life like that?

I guess my point is that no matter how dark it seems, how hopeless it feels, or how incompetent you think you are, there’s always a chance for it to get better. I’m moreso making this post to look back on the next time I’m suicidal, but I’m hoping my message will help others a little.

1598097660.0,"For the first time in my life, I talked with a professional about this and was told that I was downright abused and it's like a weight has been lifted off - It wasn't my fault. I wasn't a troubled kid.","\*\*\* please read the edit \*\*\*

For a brief moment in my life from ages 15 to the summer before I turned 17, I lived with my dad and his girlfriend. My dad was a passive, quiet guy that wasn't around much. He didn't want custody, but accepted to take me and my brother who was 12 at the time to live with him while my mom was in Europe taking care of someone. The whole situation was odd. This woman, let's call her C, had an 11 year old son and was not happy about two more kids being added onto her plate. My dad promised we were no trouble and that I was old enough not to need babysitting.

I was rebellious, like most 15 year olds. I was energetic, popular, and sporty. I had just broken up with my boyfriend, and I was just starting high school. Things are already horrible, and to add a stranger to the mix was ever more shitty. After we moved out and went back to live with my mother, I was never the same person. I told my therapist that I wanted to go back to that 15 year old girl again. I was so happy and fun. He asked me to describe when things changed, and this all came up...

This woman legit abused me, and nobody said anything. Nobody defended me, and I blamed myself. I thought I was troubled, that I was difficult, that it was my fault, that my dad didn't like me.

I bleached the lower part of my hair and colored it hot pink. When she found out, she dragged me to the bathroom and locked the door and stood in front of it. She didn't let me out until I cut the parts I had bleached. My hair went from almost above my bra to shoulder length. It looked horrible too. All the while, this large woman with shaved tattooed eyebrows stood behind me and yelled at me.

*Your father will blame me for this! What an idiot! I should just make you cut it all off! Either you do it or I'll do it for you!*

I clearly remember shaking and cutting my hair. She made me clean the bathroom, explain to my dad that I had made a mess of my hair and had to do this and apologize for it.

She convinced my dad not to let me go on a 3-day school trip because she thought I must be grounded for a month because I had stolen her wifi password. Her stupid 0000 wifi password. She said that I couldn't be trusted, and how could my dad let me go on this trip? So, I was grounded and not allowed to go - and I was the ONLY freshman not there.

She took my phone and only gave it back when I called my mom crying about it and she had to have a fight with dad from across the world. Finally, my dad decided my phone was out of the question.

The worst thing, aside from the hair, was when my friends and I decided to go to a party when I was 16. We got ready at our place, and were just leaving when she stopped us yelling and screaming.

*Why would you think it's ok to leave my house looking like a whore? get back here!*

And then she dragged me back to the house and pushed me to my room, legit attacked me and took off my clothes and made me wipe off my make-up and change into something else. My friends were frozen out of fear, I came out looking beaten (she didn't actually hit me, though) and miserable and crying. I just told them to just go - and we all ran out of that house. I was humiliated. I wanted to die. My friends didn't know what to do. One of them asked if she always treated me like that. ""What a bitch""

That night, she came into my room to let me know she only did that because she cares about my dad and what he thinks of her. Also that she doesn't want her son to see these things at his age!

She did that a lot. Randomly talking to me about what a great person she was and how wise she was. Once she sat me down to tell me I was acting out and that she knew I was a good girl deep down, but trying to fight her and that it was natural. She made me feel crazy and ungrateful. She would play the victim constantly. My dad was barely there, much like before, but when he was - he was yelling at me because she'd told him I was nothing but trouble.

She broke my spirit. I was too tired to fight her. I gave up fighting her, I just legit gave up. When I told these to my therapist, he said that abuse is exactly like this. They close a door on you, but don't teach you how to open another one... so you're just lost. I needed someone to love me, to pay attention, to tell me I was doing a good job getting straight A's in school. Instead, I got constant yelling and criticism and guilt.

I'm 26 years old now... and I've just realized what this monster has done to me. She's the reason my life is miserable now. I wasn't a bad kid. I wasn't a trouble maker. I was just a teenager, and this woman made it her mission to break me and she did. My dad never married her, and I have no idea what's happened to her. I've also never told my mom. I mean, she knew that I was having ""trouble"" but I never told her my side of the story.

I don't know how I'm going to overcome this, but I'm done feeling like the victim. I now know why I'm no longer happy and care-free and energetic. I know exactly when things changed. I'm the same person, I just had a door closed on my face and nobody showed me how to open another one. I'm gonna build one and walk through it now. Fuck you, C. I hope you get what you deserve. I'm sure she kept telling herself she was being ""responsible"" or that was her job - but all she had to do was NOT ruin some kid's life.

IMPORTANT EDIT: I just need to say this, since this is getting some reads... Please please please if you just don't feel good - that doesn't necessarily mean sad or angry, it could just be ""out of it"" - try and find the reason for it. I've tried for years. I've been in therapy since I was 17, and I started cutting myself. I used to think it was because of guys, or because of my parents' divorce, or because of x and y and... I only realized what this was all about when I told my therapist that the last time I was truly happy was when I was 15. He made me write about every single year of my life, and we went through it like a TV show and figured out what exactly happened. I didn't even think of this woman for much of my adult life. But now, everything's a lot clearer. So - just please talk to someone. Write. Writing is incredible, and it doesn't even cost anything. But if you write and talk to someone who knows what to look for - that's what matters. ",mentalhealth

1577557210.0,It's okay to be a male with mental health problems.,"Kind of an inflammatory title but it comes with a story and a bit of advice so buckle in.

Growing up I didnt have any problems with mental health. I was raised southern Baptist, worked on cars with my dad while still in diapers. When I could walk I learned home improvement, drywall, painting, ect. I was raised to be strong, protect my sisters and my mom. I was raised that men dont cry, men dont hurt. I grew up thinking that I had to be strong in all moments and never let down my guard. 

Fast forward to 2 years ago. I was driving home on the not so good side of town very very late at night when I saw a guy leaning in the window of a car. (Drug deals not uncommon out in the open) He turned away from the car and jerked violently before falling down onto the street. I slammed my car to a stop, threw up the brake and jumped out, not knowing what was happening. 

I always carry a firearm on me and had it on my side. I approached the male laying on the ground when the guys from the car he was leaning in opened their door. When they stood up the only thing I remember seeing was the barrel of their gun. Couldn't tell you what they looked like, what color the car was, hell even if it was a guy or a girl. I pulled my weapon when I saw this and we both paused for what felt like hours, days. I wasnt breathing. We just started at each other while I was aimed dead in that person's chest. 

I didnt pull the trigger.

The person jumped back in their car and sped off after what seemed like an eternity and I holstered my weapon and ran to the guy in the street. He was shot in the lower left of his back, blood pumping out of a small circle wound. Holding pressusre on it with one hand and trying to dial 911 with the other I tried to stop and much bleeding as possible. After hanging up with 911 the wait began. 

I took my jacked off and laid it under him. (With it being cold out and him losing blood you want to keep his core as warm as possible. Help arrived almost exactly 1 hour later. My hand had frozen, literally frozen to this mans skin in a frozen seal of blood. 

Greg was his first name and he made a full recovery.

I moved on from that day different. Over the course of the next year I would have night terrors of the image of that gun, the blood pumping out of his skin, being alone with him desperately trying to keep him alive. I couldn't be in public with out my heart racing and having to leave. I didnt trust new people I was meeting. I was scared to be alone at any times. It came to a head when I tried to end everything. 

With out going into it to much I didnt. I went straight to family for help and explained everything. My mom took me in, I found a therapist that I enjoyed and got put on a medication to calm the terrors. The first time I talked to the therapist I cried. I cried and cried for the first time in my life. Cried like a baby and let all the manly machismo go. I was vulnerable and she held me through it. She understood and didnt judge. She saved me.

One year of therapy later I have a totally different outlook on mental health. After reading through this sub I figured this story could help someone. It is okay for men to hurt. It doesnt make you less of a man to be struggling with something. It is okay to break down and not have the solutions. 

Please, if you are someone who thinks you will be judged negatively for having ""something wrong"" or being broken in some way, there is help. I am forever grateful I found help when I did.

Sorry if the story is kinda rushed or mistyped, kinda a hard subject to bring up.

1623329096.0,I'm sick of therapists using CBT where it isn't helpful,"I'm getting really sick of people who are all about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Positive Psychology and think having a positive attitude is the end all be all of mental health treatment. There are many people who benefit from this type of therapy, don't get me wrong, but the people who are suffering most often see it as writing them off. If you are deep in poverty, in an abusive relationship, jobless, homeless, or preoccupied with messages from voices you hear, these methods do not work. Therapists need to take this into account when working with people who fit into these categories, but also initially with all patients. There should be an understanding that people aren't very open at first in therapy in general and could have any of these things going on and not tell you. Simply saying you need to change your thoughts doesn't work. People may be in situations where their thoughts are about real problems they need to face every day. I understand trying to make it easier for that person and that is what you think you're doing, but really you are just making your job easier. You, as a therapist, would be much better off starting with asking what kind of therapy someone is looking for and describing the different forms if necessary. Different forms fit different people and I'm sick of CBT being the gold standard. 

It really makes my blood boil when I hear someone say their therapist doesn't listen, and most of the time it's because they are trying to use CBT and Positive Psychology where they don't belong. Sometimes life really is hard for that person, and trying to get them to think differently about it is an exercise in futility. People are often quietly in crisis, and I see these approaches as inherently dismissive of this fact. 

I hope someone sees this and knows they can advocate to their therapist for something different, because I have had to multiple times and it is not easy.",mentalhealth

I called all the closest people in his life and they came over and stayed so I wasn’t alone. He was okay with it and told me he needed help, to please help him. We started off going to a voluntary inpatient. He was in the waiting room and it was going well, until he broke. He threatened everyone there and stripped down naked. At that point they called some firefighters to take him to a regular hospital to make sure there were no drugs in his system. There weren’t. He was okay in the hospital as well, until he wasn’t. He got super angry and scared, which is understandable. But he threatened everyone there as well. I know that’s not my husband. But he continued to threaten me and told me he’s going to kill me and that he’s the devil. At that point I had to leave the room, I was legitimately scared for my life. Now we’re at the point where he might have to go to a court ordered treatment. I’m so so scared for him and wish I could take him home but there’s no way I can without getting really hurt or dying. I know treatment facilities aren’t great. But please someone tell it’s okay what I had to do. I really hope I see my real husband again, and when I do I hope he forgives me for leaving that hospital room when he threatened to kill me and “make me feel loved”. I’m not okay, he’s not okay.

She was a warrior. She exuded warmth and light. She saved my life.

I have suffered from OCD, anxiety, and depression for 9 years. It has taken so much from me, but this loss was particularly cruel.

I believe I am speaking through Annika when I ask you to please stay. Please fight for your life. You matter. I love you. It does get better. I have been on medical leave of absence many times, I have seen more than a dozen providers, and I have given up on my biggest dream. I am also first-generation, and I have experienced the stigma surrounding mental illness in my community firsthand. But in this particular moment, I feel peace and love. I could not have imagined that on my darkest day. Your fight is valid and you are strong; please reject anything that suggests otherwise. Please take strength from Annika's words and my journey. Please carry on with the hope that she instilled in me. This life can still be beautiful for you.

And now, I ask that you please help me honor this beautiful soul.

Annika said, 'I admired and adored \[Avril Lavigne\] so much when I was a teenager, her music literally saved me back then.' She had a ticket for Avril’s concert in Germany—it would have been her second time—but it was cancelled due to COVID.

1615673048.0,Abuse [trigger warning],"My dad wanted to sleep with me.
He made me chat with adults on the internet. He pretended that I was his sister. He talked about threesomes with me and strangers. He justified it to himself. He got off to these fantasies, under a blanket, thinking I didn't notice.

He laid on the couch with me. He asked if I was too warm, and if I wanted to take off my clothes. I said no. He touched my stomach and told me I was soft. He told me I was beautiful, that I had a soft back. He asked if I wanted to take off me clothes. I said no. It felt like forever before he gave up.

1621517338.0,Why are people like this allowed to be psychiatrists?,"I went to a psychiatrist for the first time today. I had quite high hopes because he has an incredible reputation and lots of good reviews online. I was sent there by my psychologist because she couldn't quite figure out what was wrong with me.

I had prepared quite well for the appointment, I had brought a list of the maybe-diagnoses my psychologist had given me and the corresponding symptoms. (For context: she diagnosed a medium depression, depersonalisation- and derealization syndrome, hallucinations and possibly psychosis)

When I said I brought a list, he said he'd rather I tell him about it myself. Fair enough, I tried to. He interrupted me before I could get into the second diagnosis on my list, telling me not to use words like ""depersonalisation"" for myself. Those words are for people that are really sick, not people like me. 

He kept asking me what my boyfriend does and if he's mentally stable, if I'm happy with him. The appointment was supposed to last an hour, we were done in 15 minutes because he didn't ask me anything about me. He dismissed everything I said I was experiencing, he said I was making myself more sick than I actually was. He said I was a really sensitive, frail person and I shouldn't use medical terms to describe my symptoms. 

He ended the appointment with a well-loved classic, I need to go on runs, it works just as well as an anti-depressant! I have chronic back issues and am not supposed to run. I told him that and got the ""stop making yourself more sick than you are, you're young and healthy"" speech again.

I'm so exhausted, that was such a terrible appointment and I feel so stupid now. I'll never go there again.

The only times that I feel OK are when I'm stoned, like right now. And - rarely- when very comfortable with friends in a loving home environment. I never felt like this once while I was living with my parents.

I gave up a lot to feel better, I even quit my job and left everything behind on a spiritual journey, and yet after a lot of (enjoyable) adventures I still feel the same.

I have always been of strong character and hard working, people who know me would say I'm life and soul, funny, intelligent and strong. Recently though I've found myself slipping into a routine of staying up late and sleeping all day and being lazy. I cocoon myself in my duvet and wrap a pillow around my head and try to sleep as long as possible. I can wake momentarily and remember my dreams quite vividly (they are always enjoyable happy dreams) I can then just remember the dream and slip back into them. 

It's like I'm addicted to my dreams and as soon as I wake I try and try to enter back into that world. Sometimes I'm successful but after 12 hours sadly I am in the real world. 

I am in danger of losing my job because of this now which worries me even more. It's quite apparent that I must be depressed. I have so much to be grateful for but it appears the big D has taken over my life. Can I regain my normal life? This is the first time I've ever spoke about it to anyone, probably the wrong place to seek help, I have no idea. I need to sort my sh*t out before I lose my job and subsequently my house then I shall be at rock bottom.",mentalhealth
1558639977.0,"High schools need therapists and real resources for suicidal students, not just non-suicide contracts","First time posting here, please don’t mind the rambly-ness of this. Today I was thinking about something that happened years ago that made me realize schools don’t do much about suicidal students. 

When I was in high school I was severely depressed and going through a really difficult time in my life due to my parents divorce, particularly after being sent to live with my neglectful and abusive dad. I was self harming, battling an eating disorder, and was barely sleeping at night. I was absolutely struggling pretty clearly on the outside. I had a teacher tease me for looking so miserable at school every day and I got in trouble for being inattentive or dozing off in classes among my high-achieving peers. It was a rough time. 

I remember changing a password to something I accessed at school to iwannadie. It must have been flagged because I was sent to my guidance counselor, who really only ever gave people advice and help with applying to college, and she basically got me in trouble and threatened to tell my parents, and made me sign a contract that I wouldn’t kill myself. It totally cured me of all depression and I was never suicidal again! /s

Anyway, it upsets me that they didn’t do anything more about this. They didn’t mention it to my parents or anyone else, they never followed up again, and didn’t have a therapist or a professional to refer me to, in school or out. 

Schools need to have a resource for students. I was so vulnerable and depressed and I was shamed for it rather than helped. Guidance counselors don’t really have time for this, which is understandable, but they MUST have someone else there to support students during tough times if that’s the case.",mentalhealth

I sleep all day, I never join the family to eat or watch a movie, I spend all of my time in my room. I failed my classes, although I used to get straight A’s. I never go out anymore, I haven’t hung out with any of my friends in months. I don’t even walk my dogs. Or at least that’s just what it looks like right?

I’m not lazy. I hate it here. I’m miserable, my mind is in constant pain. Everything feels so heavy and difficult. Why do I have to participate in a life that just causes me so much pain? Why do I have to get a job, when doing so causes a massive downward spiral in my mental health? Why do I need to keep going to school when it makes me feel totally and utterly filled with dread and fear? Other people want me here more than I do. 

I feel like most people are given a shiny, fun, new toy, and some of us are given old dusty broken shit from the thrift store. And they wonder why we won’t just “play with it, live a little, have fun! Be happy with what you’ve got! Enjoy it!”  Like, I’m sorry for hating it. I’m sorry for hating my life. I’m sorry my brain doesn’t do shiny, fun, cool things, and it resembles the broken toy a bit more. People who have never experienced serious mental health issues have no idea what it’s like for us. If their toy gets a scratch, they can polish it. My toy is way too broken to even bother trying to polish it. It’s so invalidating and exhausting to even exist near people who don’t understand because I can feel the constant judgement. 

When normal people feel sad, they can watch a movie or call a friend to cheer themselves up. And it genuinely works for them. I can’t escape the brokenness of my mind even when I’m “happy”. It’s always there, and I can always feel it no matter what. Lately, the weight has been too heavy to bear. So I know it looks like it, but I promise I’m not lazy.

1592811682.0,"I tried so hard to love this country, but after all of the racism and indifference I’ve faced, I’m happy I can finally leave.","I’m from an Indian (India not Native American) family. They were born in India, but I was born here in the United States. I’ve lived here in the Southeast for my whole life. I’ve always faced so much racism. I’ve been called a terrorist for my skin color more times than I can remember. 

The media so often uses us as the butt of jokes (looking at you Disney Channel) and even some politicians do too. Joe Biden made a joke about Indians being gas station owners (my parents are lawyers with American accents). Nobody cares though. I’m just expected to suck it up. 

I tried so hard to look at the bright side. To look at how much opportunity and financial success this country has provided, and that is something I will always be very grateful for. I tried so hard to love this nation, but I just can’t. I’ve been told to “go home” by some people. Despite being born here and living here my whole life, I’ll never be seen as a true American. 

Despite that I just can’t stand it any more. It’s not the racism so much, but the indifference and invalidation. That’s the real depressive thing. 

Anyway, this isn’t to say that all Americans are like this. I’ve met plenty of fantastic ones who understand and sympathize, but there are just too many of the bad apples in this country for me to want to stay. 

I was lucky enough to intern in, and get a full time job in London. I’m so ecstatic to move there. The fact that I’m ethnically Indian won’t be my defining factor there like it is here. At least there I’ll be “the American” and not “the Indian.” 

Systemic Barriers like racial preferences in college admissions don’t exist at top universities like they do here. I went to college at UVA, and while it was leagues better than high school in terms of overt racism, the invalidation and indifference of overt racism toward ethnic Indians was still 100% there. So if I have kids, they’ll grow up in a country where their skin color isn’t their defining factor. 

I don’t mean to offend anyone with this soapbox. If you’re an American who gets what I’m saying, then thank you, and I am grateful that people like you exist. I acknowledge you and will never lump you in with the other people alluded to.",mentalhealth
1620221048.0,Best friend took her own life: the aftermath and everything else,"November 2020 my best friend(17F) committed suicide. It was honestly one of the most traumatic things I've ever had to go through, and my boyfriend(18M) and I also broke up about a week after her death. (Just to clarify, he didn't break up with me because he didn't want to deal with me going through my best friend's suicide. Our breakup was a long time coming, it just unfortunately happened at a really bad time).

November through January was the most difficult time of my life. I struggled so so much. I think I had so much trauma from that time, that I literally cannot remember a single thing from those two and a half months. I just remember this constant feeling of numbness and having a breakdown every couple of days. I missed my ex-boyfriend and I missed my best friend so so much. Somehow I've lost my two best friends, the two most important people in my life only eight days apart. It was awful. 

I'm doing much much better now. I've made new friends, I've kissed new boys, I'm going to social events with my friends (Covid is currently under control in my country, don't worry xx). I've realized that breaking up with my now ex-boyfriend was one of the best things I've EVER done for myself. Please don't get me wrong, he's a phenomenal person with a beautiful heart. I still have so much love for him, but we weren't meant to be together in the long run, and I've realized that now. Our relationship became toxic, not because either of us were toxic individuals, but because we weren't good for each other anymore. 

As for my best friend... Zara my beautiful beautiful angel. I miss you every day, but I know how much pain you were in. This world didn't deserve you, sunflower-child. I still feel you everywhere around me. I feel you when the sun hits my back when I'm laughing with my friends at school, I feel you when I'm making out with younger boys on golf courses and I know you would've approved. I feel you around me when I'm drinking beers with my boys and dancing with my girls.  You're always around, I know it!

I miss you so much, but I know you're in a place where you're happy, and that you're finally at a place where you don't have pain and where you can truly be yourself. I love you, you selfless and kind person.


To the people who read this post, I truly hope that you are doing well. I wish you the best. I just really needed to write my feelings out and hit post. To send it into the universe. Please remember that things do get better ♡

1692390332.0,I got sexually assaulted 2 hours ago and my parents blame me for it [F19],"On a 1-hour ride in a crowded bus an older man kept touching my breast and offering me money after I repeatedly refused and raised my voice and tried to protect myself. The bus was so crowded I couldn't get away from him. Everyone noticed and did NOTHING said NOTHING. Other older man started watching and seemed entertained. I live in a third world country. After the man got off the bus some people started talking that it was very disturbing what he did  but NO ONE did NOTHING to stop it.

I got home crying and told my parents what happened. They blame me and tell me that it's because of the way I dressed. That I deserved it for not dressing appropriately. That it was my fault. I was dressed In a short large dress with no cleavege (I'm petite) and it's not even a dress, the skirt part is actually shorts.

I was trying to explain how miserable I am but they kept interrupting me, shouting ""you should have done that, that"". I told them about another situations that happened 4 years ago where I was also sexually assaulted in public. But that time I was dressed with a lot of clothes. They told me my fault that time was that I didn't scream or say anything. So again it's my fault. 

!!!!! They said that it's my fault that he thought I was a hooker (this hurts SO much my heart aches)

It's my fault for what happened today implying that I deserve it.

There are no words to describe how I am feeling right now. I am a very sensitive person in general and a lot of things affect me deeply.

I am crying my heart out right now in the corner of a dark room praying for someone in this world who would come right now to give me a hug and actually listen to me and understand me. I want to overcome this (I have 1 week until uni starts, idk how I'm gonna do that) but at the same time I cannot believe these are MY parents and this is what they told me and think of me. 

I am so traumatized and crying incontrollably right now that I feel like I'm gonna explode. I feel betrayed and unprotected. 

*The point for this post is that I DO NOT want to go mentally insane from everything that happened. I do not want to wake up one day in the mental hospital. My mental state is very shaky right now. Please help me , I don't know how but please help me. I don't want to lose my health*

My father left us when I was young, and I haven't had any contact with him for years. My mother's severe mood swings resemble extreme bipolar episodes, but she refuses to seek any help, making my life even harder.

It’s such a blur. But what is clear are the moments I was able to sit with her before she was taken away. The quiet in her room was deafening. I wanted it all to stop. I wanted to turn back the clock. To have one more chance. As I sat there the realization hit me like wave. Everything had changed. I couldn’t stop it. Nothing would ever be the same again. My niece... she was gone. 

It’s been sixteen months and no one has “moved on”.  It’s something we carry with us every day. It’s part of all of us. That loss, the grief, the anger and disbelief. It makes every step harder to make and every breath harder to take. 

My niece was in pain. Blinding pain. I sat on the front steps that morning and read the note she left. 10 pages of writing as the drugs took effect. She was more afraid of waking up then dying. Those were her exact words!  She was only two months shy of 18, yet she couldn’t see the light her future held. Any hope she had gathered over time had slipped through her fingers. She couldn’t hold on any longer. 

I’m grateful that her pain has stopped but I wish she could have seen or felt the love she was leaving behind. The devastation that has ripped through our family is the result of the tremendous love we all felt for her.  She was our light. She brought so much joy to us all. Yet she struggled to feel any herself. 

Life will never be the same. People tell you that things will get better in time. A big part of me wants to scream that I don’t want everything to be ok because it’s not.  We’re not and never will be. We’re all a mess. My kids still struggle every day.  She was a regular part of their life. She loved them unconditionally and them her. How do you explain why this disease could take her away and why we couldn’t help her.  They are too young to have to deal with anxiety and depression, and loss. 

What I wouldn’t give for another chance to reach her. Knowing the pain she was in crushed my soul. She had the most beautiful heart. If only she could have felt how loved she was. 

If you are struggling with depression or thinking about suicide, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE reach out for help. You are not alone. You deserve to feel love and happiness. You might not feel it or see it right now but there are people who care, who see your worth, who understand your pain, and want to help.  You can even confidentially call or text counselors who can help. I posted the link below.

1686266074.0,am i in the wrong for reporting a consensual sexual encounter?,"so basically i (21f) was baker acted (for those who don’t know it’s a mandatory 72 hour hospital stay for mental health) after, in my case, a suicide attempt. the hospital brought me to the psych ward, and i was put on suicide watch overnight there at 10pm. the guy (27m) who was the one watching me immediately started flirting, making super sexual comments, asking to see my body, etc. he was hot and i was in such a dark place so obviously i played along. like when he came in i was crying and saying how worthless i felt, etc. anyways, he started saying how much he wanted to have sex with me and how much he wanted to kiss me, so eventually he told me that if i went into the bathroom he would “have to follow me” since that was part of the suicide watch. in the bathroom we made out, and did other things, but not actual sex. this went on basically all night (10pm-7am), having sexual conversations, making out, talking about how we would meet up when i got out (he would get me pregnant and we would run away together), he got my phone number, etc. he gave me a fake name, and i later found out that he was married with a child. 

it was all consensual in the moment, like i never told him no, but thinking back on it i feel like he took advantage of the mental state i was in, and his position of power to get what he wanted. it feels like when a police officer gets with someone they arrested. 

all that to say, i feel like i did the wrong thing. i don’t know if i’m a victim. i feel like i ruined this man’s life over something that i said yes to.

one of the other patients just called me and said he kept getting into fights today because the nurses kept talking about me and saying that i’m a slut and a whore and would fuck anyone who walked and that i was lying about it. 

he went and talked to a supervisor who said that the actually did do this to someone else like 2 weeks ago during a 1 on 1, and they’re not gonna do anything about it. i feel so defeated.",mentalhealth

1619849331.0,I am one day free of abusive relationships,"So I (27M) moved house yesterday away from my ex girlfriend who was emotionally abusive and controlling since we first started dating 9 years ago and only recently did I realise how bad she actually was. 

We broke up about 6 months ago and have been living together as housemates till now and after finally moving out my sense of relief is so enormous I just want to cry. Even as housemates she was still super controlling and never gave me privacy or respect, she'd burst into my room at random moments without knocking, no matter what I was doing she would sit on my bed uninvited and talk for ages about herself to demand my attention and I was called rude if my replies weren't what she wanted. She'd never let me have a say or input about anything that went into the house, it was all just her decisions and that was final. 

I've just moved into a share house which I was terrified about since I've never lived with anyone else before and my new housemates are really lovely and welcoming and it actually feels like my place aswell. it's a weird feeling not having anyone to ""answer"" to any more but I guess it's the feeling of actual freedom! 

After narcissistic parents who were controlling and emotionally abusive too Its been a weird rough time getting to this point but my healing begins today.

1612372192.0,I keep thinking “I’d rather die than deal with anything stressful” but I don’t want to actually die.,"I always feel like anything I say or think is “being dramatic” like in dealing with Jeckyl and Hyde in my head.  I worry and stress about things that have happened, will happen, might happen, might not happen, or surely won’t happen.  My day is consumed with these thoughts to the point where I get a migraine, cry it out, hold it in, get mad.... I’ve been on anxiety medication... all of them, off and on for years.  At the point now where I’m too anxious to take anxiety medication because I’m anxious to get side effects.  Backwards I know...  I’ve seen a therapist before but not for awhile.  I always felt like I was bothering them.

But I feel strange for being like this because I am 33, I’m married, have three kids, a house, a job, a nice large family, lots of friends and cousins and a dog etc and there’s no issues... but most days I end my day thinking “I feel like if I just were to die, I wouldn’t have to deal with these feelings anymore, and I’d be free.” And that’s in regards to my irrational worry and negative thoughts that I alone put in my head.  But I don’t want to die.  I’m afraid of dying actually.  

I’ve been fine my entire life except for when I had my second son 11 years ago.  He was born with club foot.  I spent all my maternity leave going to Children’s hospital for castings, surgery, etc. He had an MRI last year and got orthopedics.  He’s fine and happy and healthy.  But since he was born I changed and I’ve developed panic attacks, anxiety, depression, IBS that put me in the ER 4 times, ulcers.  I worry that bad things will happen to me or my kids non stop.  I can’t stop the play button.  

So yes this is kind of venting but I’m at a loss and I try not to talk about this with anything because I feel like I’m being too whiny and dramatic.  Everyone’s response is always your son is fine now, basically get over it.  But I’ve always felt like I had some sort of PTSD (I don’t know if that’s actually what it would be) after my sons situation because I’ve never gotten over what he went through and what I went through mentally and financially because of it.

1606058931.0,I Dealt with a Dental Emergency All by Myself,"Basically I’ve been having unbearable tooth pain for a couple weeks.

Already, my pain is completely gone.



I’m in my (very) late twenties and have never made any kind of appointment for myself without my mom’s help before this due to my extreme anxiety. I have been doing an outpatient psychiatric program for months (which she also got me into) that has been helping me take little steps when I can.



So many of the things I had to do yesterday would’ve completely thrown me just a few weeks ago. I can’t remember ever feeling so competent and independent. I would say a lot of it was purely born of desperation from the pain in my mouth, but I’m proud of myself anyway (and mom is too).

They won't tell you not to cut and they won't call the police unless they seriously need to, they also can't see your number. They can simply listen and offer an ear. I spoke calmly about my struggles and my life and he listened for like half an hour. I honestly nearly cried he was so reassuring and spent so long with me even though I wasn't in desperate need. I came away feeling a lot better and promised to call next time i feel like cutting.

I've never called a helpline before as I thought it would be very scripted but he just got me talking about family, my partner, my house and other things. Really got my mind out of a bad place so honestly just give it a go. The worst that can happen is you feel no better

I know so many people that advocate for mental health but in reality they are just doing that to make themselves look good like they don't actually care. Those same people complain about their friends that are being ""too negative"" , those same people brag about dropping certain friends because they spend too much time alone and  never want to hang out, those are the same people that are embarrassed to be seen with their friend in public because they have self harm scars and are wearing short sleeves. They literally think that depression is just being sad and anxiety is like just being nervous about an exam. They have this version in their heads of what mental illness is that's so far from what it actually is. They kind of glamorize it in a way but there is nothing glamorous about having a mental illness. 

Again I'm just speaking from experience but i know so many people like this and it really pisses me off, they advocate so much for mental health yet they know nothing about it. They don't even try to empathize or provide some support instead they actually want nothing to do with a mentally ill person, they judged you and they just try to push toxic positivity onto you. I recently got diagnosed with depression, general anxiety disorder and CPTSD. I've had friends call me gross because at one point my depression got so bad that I didn't showed in 4 days, I've had friends that called me dramatic when I almost had a panic attack in public, I've had friends that got angry at me for not wanting to watch a movie because certain scenes triggers my PTSD, I've had friends that judged for having suicidal thoughts and they told me that ""I should think happy thoughts"" or ""You shouldn't be so negative all the time"" or ""You should be grateful because your life isn't as bad as others"".

It wasn't simply just a ""chemical imbalance; end of story"".

(Please google CPTSD if you haven't already heard of it.)

I'm gonna vent about this because I know I'm not the only one. This is something that I just recently realized and it takes a lot of weight off my shoulders to finally know why I am the way I am. This was really an eye opener for me. This is my story. *TW*

The worst part about child abuse is for a lot of us, we are too young to understand that we're even being abused. Especially in terms of emotional abuse. We don't know any different. We grew up being treated like this, and we know something doesn't feel right, but we decide it must be a problem with us. ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" 
Thankfully I did know that the physical abuse I was receiving was not okay, but honestly it took me 24 years to fully realize that I was emotionally abused as a child. 24 YEARS.

I was emotionally and physically abused by my parents and other family members (mostly my mother) starting as a very very young child, possibly infant. Of course as a child you are incapable of understanding that you are not to blame. Because of this, I believed that I was broken, horrible, and stupid. I thought something was wrong with me. Why else would my parents not love me? In my own eyes I had to be at fault. Something was wrong with me. Even as a preschooler and kindergartener I have memories of thinking ""why do I have to be me?"" and ""what's wrong with me?"". My self esteem was non-existent. 

I remember going to my pediatric doctor due to a skin infection I had as a kindergartener. I had to see this doctor weekly, and because she was so kind to me (as a doctor should be, or any adult honestly) I started to see her as a parent figure. She made me feel loved and safe when my own mother did not. I remember I brought her a picture of me that we got from school picture day. She told my parents that I must have asperger's because of how socially awkward I was and how I acting around her (the doctor.) This later proved to be false, but again added to my feeling that I was broken and bad. We stopped seeing that doctor and my parents were furious at me. Why was it not clear to this doctor that I was insecurely attached?

My self esteem and hatred towards myself only got worse as time went on, and by 4th grade I was having full on almost passing out panic attacks. Started as hypochondria, but quickly became social anxiety. I could NOT function in school because I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin. Nobody wanted to be my friend. Nobody cared about me. The teachers HATED me. And then at home, nobody loved me. When people would look at me I wanted to just disappear. I made myself believe that I was incapable of making friends or being likable which in turn basically made me be unlikable. Ironic. Nobody wanted to be around me because my anxiety made me very awkward. I viewed myself as lesser than everyone else which would follow me into adulthood. Eventually I could not talk in front of the class. If I even knew I had to say a single word in front of the class or have everyone look at me I would literally run out of the room. Complete full on flight mode. Instead of being diagnosed with ANXIETY, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I couldn't focus because I was probably always disassociating. School was not the most important thing in my mind because at both at home and at school I was trying to survive. Why on earth would school be the first thing on my mind? 

Of course I fell behind in school and struggled to keep up with assignments which in turn made me feel even more stupid. When they had psychologists coming in to my classroom to study me, it only worsened my hatred towards myself. ""They're only watching me and studying me because there's something wrong with me."" I started seeing the school psychologist, therapist and social worker weekly. I was put into remedial classes and on an IEP. I was placed in some classes with children with severe behavioral and intellectual disabilities. I was forced to take IQ tests. In 6th grade I was literally forced to STACK BLOCKS while a psychologist watched. I'll never forget seeing the notes the psychologist wrote after that. ""Lots of nervous laughter."" No shit. I'm 12 and you're having me stack 5 blocks in a specific pattern. This is after they found out I had an average IQ, mind you. Everything that they did, whether they were trying to help or not, made me feel worse about myself. ""Why can't I be like the regular kids?"" is all that went through my brain. Every single thing that happened to me only solidified the belief in my head that something was wrong with me.

I was embarrassed of my own existence.

When I'd go home and try to explain that I would shake and be so scared that I couldn't even think straight in school my parents would just scream at me. I remember getting punched in the stomach and told to suck it up after just trying to explain what was going on. I had no one to turn to. 

By 7th grade I could not go to school. If I knew I'd have to work with other students or even be looked at in front of the class I would skip school. And honestly, it wasn't that school itself was a problem. I liked school itself. I couldn't function with my low self esteem and hatred towards myself. I constantly felt singled out. I felt bad that other people even had to look at me. I was too young to put this into words, and all I was able to say to anyone about what was going on was that talking in front of the class makes me scared and shakey. 

After I started getting in trouble for missing so much school (after the school social worker and principal drove to my house to talk to my parents and do a wellness check on my family), I went with extreme measures. Even running away from home and hiding which ended up with the police looking for me. All because I didn't want to have to panic. I tried to explain my anxiety in the best way a child can without even understanding what anxiety is. I was treated like a delinquent child instead.
Ended up in court after missing hundreds of days of school and had to do weeks of community service. AT 12 YEARS OLD.

I was showing so many signs of an abused child and I had definitely brought up my family physical abuse multiple times to adults at school and nobody heard me. Nobody. I was not a delinquent. I was suffering so noticeably yet somehow nobody noticed. 

By high school I refused to wear my glasses so I wouldn't have to see people looking at me in the hallway. I was still in remedial classes all those years later, which were mostly for kids with behavioral issues.  Kids that would kick, fight, scream, do drugs, you name it - this was not me at all.  I think I gave up trying to speak out because I tried so many times and I couldn't get anyone to hear me. I ended up dropping out of high school.

Fast forward to three years ago when I was going to pursue my dream of studying and then hopefully teaching abroad in Japan. Saved up for three years for my student visa and relearned everything from the ground up to get my GED. Did both things, got accepted and started my Japanese school in Tokyo. Never in my life had I been so proud of myself. I didn't even believe I was capable of accomplishing anything in my life. The moment that plane landed I cried my first ever happy tears.

Two weeks into language school, we were going around the table of probably 20 other students learning verbs at a very fast pace. I remember time slowing down while I was waiting for it to be my turn, then I blacked out. When I came to I ran out of the classroom. I left school and walked around Tokyo sobbing. I had gotten that far and somehow completely forgot how bad my self esteem and anxiety are. My dreams completely clouded out the truth. I knew I couldn't continue with school so I dropped out, then impulsively blew all of my tuition money that I saved for years on bullshit. After coming home I hit rock bottom and was hospitalized. Once again, the belief that I was broken was renewed in my mind.

At the hospital I was told ""you're not severe enough for inpatient treatment"". The doctor spent a total of maybe 4 minutes with me. Asked me a couple questions, checked me for head injuries, and left. I went to the hospital because I knew that if I went back home I was going to end my life. I was so used to stuffing my emotions down into myself at this point in my life that even if I was on the edge of ending it all - I looked calm. I even explained to them this. After waiting 6 hours after seeing the doctor, they sent me to a place thats only purpose was to keep you from harming yourself. Great, but when I went back home I learned nothing. No coping skills, didn't talk to a single mental health professional, nothing. I was back at square one. I reached out for help for the first time as an adult and was again, failed.

Inside my head was still the once tiny little girl wondering, ""what is wrong with me?""

Memories of my childhood were again, flashing back. I sat in my room for months. I couldn't leave the house. I had no desire to exist. I ripped up every baby photo I had with my mother in them. I honestly thought I wouldn't live another year. I was going to end up killing myself. I lost all of my hope.

Now, a couple years after that I'm finally now just getting the real help I need. I had to be the one to keep reaching out. It was very hard, but I am so glad I did. I had to keep picking myself back up, again and again; If I hadn't I would not be alive. I'm so glad that I chose to fight for my life. I searched for a long time for a good psychiatrist and therapist. I finally found someone who heard me. I have even been able to forgive people who abused me. Of course I still and always will have scars, but now I am able to cope with them. 
I now know I am not broken. I am a survivor and I have been and was just trying to survive. People are now shocked when I tell them I have ""social anxiety."" Eventually I will go back to Japan when I am actually ready. 

Learning about CPTSD and realizing WHY I am the way I am has been extremely important to me. Just like I'm finally connecting the dots. I'm finally starting to love myself. The little girl that once felt so unloved is finally healing. 

I encourage all of you to learn how your trauma affects you, and know that you can also heal from it. 💕 I hope someone out there will read this and feel like there is hope. I truly hope this inspired someone out there that is in an awful place like I once was. Do not give up on yourself.

Please remember: You're not broken. You're surviving.

The cycle of abuse ends with us!",mentalhealth
1601512195.0,Threw out a self harm tool.,"Today I threw out an object that I knew I could hurt myself badly with. It was extremely hard, but I did it. 

I’ve been self harming since 2014, however, i’ve gotten clean and relapsed many times since then. I recently have been self harming on and off since December, and today I took the object I had been using, that i knew i could do a lot with, and threw it away outside of my home. I did this so I can’t go back and get it. It was really hard, but I knew I could do a lot of harm with it. I hate hiding self harm, but it’s an addiction I deal with.

1614865391.0,My experience in a psych ward,"Last Saturday, February 27th, was the one year anniversary of my ex cheating on me, I had really bad thoughts about harming her, like if I could end her life all my problems would be fixed. See, she was abusive to me and her cheating on me broke me mentally and sent me into a downward spiral that I thought was bipolar disorder. 

I had spoken with both my family doctor and a psychiatrist, and they both agreed that it seemed to be type 2 bipolar disorder. So, I started taking medicine for it. Now, let's jump back to last Saturday.

I realized these thoughts I were having were dangerous and that I needed serious help immediately, so I told my parents to take me to the hospital, being a bit vague on the details, and they did. I got to the ER and told the nurse everything that had been happening and I was sent to a bare room with only a boxed-in tv on the wall as an SIHI, meaning I was both suicidal and homocidal. 

The doctors at my hospital evaluated me and sent a report off to a bugger hospital an hour away that had a dedicated psych ward for patients like me. After 4 hours of waiting, I got the news that this better hospital would accept me as a patient. So, within 15min, I was in an ambulance and on my way to the psych ward.

When I arrived, I was immediately taken to a room where my vitals were recorded and my possessions were taken away, and I had to sign papers agreeing to treatment and their policies. Once I had completed the paperwork, I was made to put on a pair of no-slip socks for safety and was shown to my room. 

It was a fairly bare room, with just a desk to store what few clothes I could bring and two beds. I had to share my room with a nice old man named Arthur, who was there for mild schizophrenia. We also shared a simple bathroom with a toilet, sink, and shower. 

The operation of the psych ward were fairly simple. Meals were at 7:30, 11, and 4:30, and snacks were at 9, 2, and 8:30. We had ""group,"" at 10, 3, and 8 where we learned coping mechanism, positive thinking skills, and did occupational therapy to learn healthy hobbies and habits to give us an outlet for stress and creativity.

 They didnt force you to eat or go to group, though. Some of the patients only came out for meals and slept the rest of the day. Most of us stayed in the common room which had a water fountain and tv. We ended up watching HGTV or the Food Network most of the time. We did watch some Star Wars, too,  which was nice

Each shift change, a new nurse was assigned to you, and they were all very nice in my experience. They brought me my daytime medicine right around 9am and my nighttime medicine around 8pm. Every morning and night your nurse would come to you and ask you questions like how your day was, to rate your anxiety and depression on a scale of 1-10, and so forth. 

Your doctor would come around every morning as well to discuss outpatient plans with you to get you set up for when you leave the hospital, as well as discuss or change your medications. My doctor ended up changing my Lexapro for Prozac, upping my dosage of Lamictal, and adding Remoron to the mix. 

Alongside the doctor, I also saw a psychologist who gave me a thorough evaluation. He let me sit down and talk to him about my life leading up to how I got to the psych ward, and he filled up 3 pages full of notes. Afterwards, I took a 567 true/false quiz called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the Rorschach Test. 

I was in the psych ward until today, March 3rd. Before I left, I had one last talk with my doctor, who gave me a briefing on the psychologist's report. It turns out, I have autism. Specifically, I have Asperger's, so that was a pretty big shock to me. 

I think the biggest thing I learned in my stay at the psych ward was that the other patients are just like you and me. They're completely normal people who just need some help. None of them were mean or psychopaths. They were all just average joes with bad anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I thoroughly enjoyed talking with and getting to know them. 

So, thanks for reading about my experience in a psych ward. I will be more than happy to answer any questions you have",mentalhealth
1558466008.0,My depression is lifting. I haven't felt this happy in 3 years.,"My depression and anxiety had its up and downs ever since I first started working. It went downhill in March when despite having a great therapist and taking meds, I got very suicidal. I was on the edge of the subway platform. I felt like a failure.

&#x200B;

I've been on sick leave since then. I thought I had disappointed so many people in my life, but my therapist has helped me in forgiving myself and moving on little by little. I decided not to go back to my current teaching position for the next school year, which will cause financial instability, but I'm in such a better mentality. Being close with my mom, she has noticed that I smile and talk more, and that what she thought was ""normal stress"" was me barely managing my depression the past three years. I was desperate to ""fix myself,"" and to just ""suck it up because everyone has work stress.""

&#x200B;

I have so much respect for teachers. I am interviewing for other schools, but I will most likely do a mix of tutoring/sub work/reception. I am still sad that I couldn't push through another school year, but I am feeling happier that I don't have to go back. I have options. And maybe someday, I will go back to the classroom in the future. I'm working on hobbies I've completely abandoned when I was working. Teaching is a huge commitment. I have mixed feelings about my ideal work situation, but I'm glad I'm taking the time to reflect and slowly plan my next steps.

1641566578.0,Taking vitamin D pills cured my depression,"Just putting this out there. My therapist thought I had depression. I thought I had depression. My friend made me take vitamin D pills as a test. 
I'm not depressed anymore and actually wake up with energy and excitement now. 

Vitamin D supplements are super cheap and you can even buy them on Amazon. Consider giving it a try. I noticed the change after only 3-4 days already.

But if you take any meds, check in with your doctor or at least Google to ensure it's safe for you to add the vitamin D supplements (there's like three meds that you'd have to be careful with, as far as I know). 

Additionally, if you're vegetarian/vegan or just don't eat a lot of meat, an iron deficiency could also be a reason for your depression. Iron supplements are also on Amazon for little money.

Hope this helps someone out ❤️


Edit: 
As this is getting a lot of traction: What this post was about is that my therapist as well as I thought that I had depression. But taking vitamin D solved many problems for me. A vitamin D deficiency can cause many of the symptoms depression does, up to the point of a misdiagnosis. That's why this post exists. Some people may be misdiagnosed, some people may not even have a therapist to diagnose them so they did it themselves and rolled with it. 

This post is a suggestion to consider the possibility and try something new, to raise awareness that something that looks and feels like depression doesn't have to be exactly that.

1588288197.0,Was anyone else called a spoiled brat growing up (or anything close to that) but now realize it was a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues?,"TLDR at the bottom. 


Growing up, my mood was unpredictable. It was a constant state of anger, immaturity, anxiety, and fear. My parents gave me stuff I wanted but were pretty ignorant when it came to my mental health issues. They thought I would outgrow my behaviors or treat me the same way they treated my brothers. Thinking about it now, numerous reg flags were there. I was very defiant and scared of a lot of things. Many of them irrational. I remember being in like junior high and my mother telling me to get something from the car while we were at a family friends party. It was dark already and I took one look outside, saw the car parked across the street and got scared. Idk of what but my mind told me to be scared. I asked my friend to come with me but she didn’t want to and I think she was scared too because it was dark. I go back to my mom who is talking to her friends and tell her I’m scared and “(friend) doesn’t want to go with me.  I don’t want to go to the car” (friends mom was in the circle of friends like 10 of them and I was hoping she would make her go with me (I know subtle tattletale, in junior high too...currently cringing)) and my mom ended up going with me to the car. I didn’t think much of this but the next day my dad told me that one of the parents called me a spoiled brat as soon as I left with my mom to the car. Looking back I should have told my mom personally but I didn’t think it would matter since the people we were surrounded by were childhood friends who knew me at a young age. 

Growing up in my house was overall not good emotionally. Lots of instability with my father’s moods and sometimes my mother’s. I ended up being a rude child and would get angrily reprimanded by my parents (sometimes physically even if it didn’t hurt...it still did...if that makes sense). I remember saying goodbye to my parents friends (at their friends house) by just waving the off in an “eh” manner (I tried to be cute and joke with them...also I was half tired) my parents pushed me to hug them and kiss them (cultural thing) but I was just like “meh” and didn’t. I didn’t realize I was embarrassing my parents and their friends. I came off as rude. I was like 12 or 13 at the time. As soon as we got into the car my dad exploded in anger and shouted at me to never do that again. He said this while also putting his fist to my knee banging on my knee every time I didn’t give a coherent “yes” to him when he told me to never act that way again. I was in tears. I really didn’t think anything of my actions. Looking back, yeah it is rude of me but I don’t think they was the correct parental way to go about things. 

There were many instances like this. Where I would come off rude and anxious especially when I didn’t get my way with things. Forcing my friends to play with me when they didn’t want to. Telling on them to their older siblings hoping they would make their sibling play with me only to be told “she doesn’t want to play with you. That’s not my problem”, picking fights with my siblings, screaming and shouting loud enough that the neighbors can hear me... 

I was recently diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, and ADHD. In addition to my MDD, OCD, and GAD. I feel like a light just switched on this year and made me go “oh wow I really wasn’t a normal kid”.

tldr: to a lot of people growing up I came off as an annoying and rude immature brat but after analyzing a lot of my behaviors and my upbringing as an adult, I now realize it was possibly a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues.",mentalhealth

1592706236.0,Why does my (20m) mind immediately default to suicide when something bad happens to me?,"(I meant 20F and now I can't change the title)

I am very prone to spiralling, or snowballing, when something bad happens to me. 

Recently, I've been getting into arguments with my mum and it's been making me feel like shit. She tells me I'm brainwashed, makes me feel stupid, and a lot more. When I brought it up to her she denied the lot and the only apology I got was a 'sorry you feel that way' 

This isn't something small, I don't think, but i also feel as though I'm overreacting, but that just makes me feel worse, and so the spiral begins.

And it always ends with a 'you should just kill yourself'. Almost always followed with a 'no you retard thats a bad idea' 

Because other than little things like that, my life is fine. I have friends, a loving partner (long distance atm), a roof over my head and hot meals. I'm fine. Yet I'm not. And, again, it makes me feel worse that there are people who have it so, so badly, and yet I have the audacity to feel the way I do?

I do not want to bring any of this up to my mother. She would just gaslight me again. My partner knows, though, and is as supportive as he can be in the current situation. That's all I can ask for, right?

I’m also not strong for simply just not killing myself, every time I hear that shit it’s always from someone who has no idea what it’s actually like to be suicidal 100% of the time. I *want* to kill myself, there’s no part of life that I enjoy or that I feel is worth sticking around for and yet I still can’t bring myself to *actually* do it.

I guess that to me, hearing that shit is just a reminder that no one fucking gets it, like 99% of people will just never understand and so they say stupid shit trying to be helpful and don’t realise they’re only really telling you how alone you really are. There’s nothing fucking strong about a man who’s terrified of everyone, who’s constantly suicidal but is too afraid to act on it, and who will never even get to see his own adult body not covered in deep self-harm scars.

1610737811.0,People in their 20s: Ever feel like running out of time?,"I always try to stay positive in front of everyone I know and most people around me thinks that I have my life all figured out. But what they don’t know is that once I’m alone, I get sucked into this deep hole of anxiousness and overthinking that keeps me up all night. I tried seeking professional help but none of it helped me. 

I kind of had my 2020 planned out but the virus ruined everything for me. I wanted a career change because I no longer want to work for a job that was way too far my major (plus it’s draining and it’s not really my passion) and I’ve always wanted to leave since the last quarter of 2019. I had no other choice but to stay within my present company cause I can’t afford to lose a job during a crisis. 

But I made a promise to myself to really stick to my decision and find a job that I’m really passionate about once this year starts...

However, job hunting isn’t really going well for me and to top that, I’m doing awful at my current job (maybe because I just don’t find the joy in working anymore + i just can’t seem to focus). Also, I started a small business just last year and it’s also not doing well as of the moment.

Everything’s all piled up, I don’t what to do, I can’t seem to find something I’m good at, I want to leave but I don’t have the courage to do so. I want to do a lot of things, but I feel like I’m just so lost. I don’t know where to start, how to start.

I can't get over the mistakes of my past, where I did or said mean things in the heat of the moment, or when I did or said things that were cringy or stupid.

Sometimes I feel like I might have been toxic because I sometimes default to sadness when I wanted attention from others. I put myself down a lot, now I realize I do that so people would lift me up and I would feel good (sometimes people would agree with me tho lmao). I hate that i did that and some people might potentially see me as a manipulator, even if I hate that and wouldn't consciously seek to do that...

1570566864.0,I finally shaved!!!,"Before anyone asks: I am a girl.

I haven't shaved in months and if you're grossed out by that, stop reading now. 

I haven't shaved anywhere. Legs, armpits, pubic area. It just seemed too overwhelming. My boyfriend doesn't mind, so my sex life didn't really get worse because of that and I live in a colder climate, so wearing long pants during the summer was completely normal.

To be honest, I kinda liked how things were. Less waste, more time, less skin irritation and stuff. But I knew it didn't come from my worldview, but from my depression. Shaving is the least important, as I could go days without eating, without brushing my teeth and showering. 

So before I go on: shaving isn't necessary, showering is. So if you're a male, female, whatever, just don't shave if you don't want to. It's not a part of hygiene. You won't ""sweat more"" because of some hair. But take a shower from time to time. Not a full-on spa singing one hour shower, but get in there for a few minutes. Even if it'll be just standing under pouring water. 

But if you want to - just like I did - go for it. I shaved my whole body today, I used some coconut oil on my legs and scented oil under my armpits (zero-waste deodorant!). Apart from that, I also did a full on skin care routine and brushed my teeth AND flossed. Wow.
I'm sure most people do it regularly and it grosses them out when they have a single piece of salad between their teeth after a meal. But for me, it was a huge milestone. I hope to do it again tomorrow, without forcing myself. I haven't felt this fresh and sexey in quite some time. Next goal: laundry!",mentalhealth
1556203566.0,"Mental illnesses do not affect us in equal ways, but they all suck.","My sentiments are based on being subscribed to the sub and seeing a pattern in which posts make it into my feed. This is not an attack on the sub, it's a suggestion to represent all the colors of the rainbow here.

This sub seems to mostly pay attention and support people whose mental illness makes it difficult for them to perform basic functions, like getting out of bed. I understand that life with mental illness is like a 10k race. For those struggling with the basics, every day moving a yard feels like a war against yourself, but what about those of us who are sprinting? 

I leave my house daily for work, social gatherings etc but I face many difficulties each day stemming from mental illness. I come here and I make posts about it. Hoping to find someone who feels the same. Who lives that struggle. Just one person who relates and reaches out and says yeah I'm drowning in my own thoughts too. Or hey I used to struggle with that here's what helped me. 

But I get nothing. And I see no posts on my feed from others who live a similar struggle. I'm sure they're out there, but their posts get buried or if they're anything like me, they delete them later because if no one feels the same, what's the point. All the support goes to the ones who seem to be struggling the most outwardly.

It reminds me of when I was a kid, and I had a troubled sister. I went to school, had poems put in the newspaper, great grades and had a few short stories published in books, but no one in my home paid any mind. When I left for college I asked my mother why she left me to my own devices so often. Why she didn't put so much effort into me like with my sister. She replied; ""because you've always done so well on your own, I didn't think you need me."" That has stuck with me even to this day,and that's how I feel about this sub. 

The support isn't shared and I think we all could do more to make sure there's a variety of lifestyles affected by mental illness getting the attention they deserve. No struggle is worth more than another, but they all need some help.",mentalhealth

Everyday is still a struggle but, I’m at peace with that and just take things as they come. 

The problem I have is that I sometimes feel like I don’t deserve to have a mental illness. If that makes sense. I had a rough childhood, but when I start to have a break down or anxiety attack, I always think something along the lines of 

“There are definitely people that have had it worse than I have and they are just fine.” 
Or
“Whatever is happening isn’t as bad as what other people go through and I should just suck it up” 

My rational healthy brain tells me everything is relative blah, blah, blah. All the logical things a normal brain would think. Then my unhealthy brain just yells over the logic with intrusive thoughts that I don’t deserve to have these mental issues because my life “isn’t that bad”

1663026768.0,To the teenagers behind me at the store,"I'm sure you thought the comments you made about me were clever, that must be why you said them loudly enough for everyone within 20 feet to hear. I assume it was super amusing making fun of me based on the giggles and laughs from your group behind me as I used the self check out for the few things I was buying. Since you lot are obviously comedic geniuses I thought I'd share your wittisms.

""Omg why would she ever leave her house in shorts?!"" Said by the pretty blonde girl whose shirt I internally admired earlier. 

You were pretty spot on since I'd hadn't worn shorts outside my home in almost 2 years. I had finally found a pair that fit well and were long enough so I thought they looked ok. Thank you for disabusing me of that notion.

""She probably doesn't leave the house often anyway. Maybe she's afraid she won't fit through the door one of these days."" Said from who I assume was blondie's boyfriend. 

Well, you were wrong about the door thing, that's a full on exaggeration because even I know I'm not that big. However you were right about me not leaving the house often but it has nothing to do with weight. It's because I'm still severely depressed over the unexpected passing of my fiancé less than 2 years ago.

""Look she's buying spinach! I guarantee it's not for her!"" This was from the brunette with blue highlights. 

Sorry to disappoint but it's totally for me.

""Why doesn't she just get that weight loss surgery? She would obviously qualify."" From a different brunette. 

Well actually honey, I already had it when I was 17 and barely qualified. This was in the very early days of bariatric surgery and I obviously didn't have ideal results. What's even worse though is it's left me with multiple, life long health issues and chronic pain. I've had to have several additional surgeries to try and correct things, with little success. A lot of those health issues mean medication and many of those medications have weight gain as a side effect. I also have Hypothyroidism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome which both can cause weight gain. As can depression, which I mentioned earlier.

""I'd kill myself if I ever got that big."" Said by blondie. 

I guess it's A: good you're not because no matter how horrible your comments I would never wish for you to feel like you needed to die and B: I guess I'm mentally stronger than you. That's probably because of all the shit I've been through but believe me there are often days when I think I'd be better off dead. And I'd be lying if I didn't say how hard it was after hearing your comments to just make it to my car before I broke down crying. 

I don't know why you all felt the need to be so cruel but I hope eventually you learn to have a little more empathy. You don't know me or my story, but you judged me based solely on my weight and found me lacking. Therefore I was worthy of your scorn. 

Your comments hurt, and I imagine they will stick with me for awhile, but they won't break me. However, someday, if you continue this act you might end up being the last straw that does break someone. I hope you never have to realize that your comments pushed a person to end their life and I also hope you never have to feel the way you made me feel today.

1623792334.0,It's been a month since I decided not to kill myself.,"A month ago I jokingly told my online friend that nobody would care if I died (not directly but it was obvious I was talking about that) and she said that she would cry if I died. That's what broke me. I never cry but that was the first time in months where I cried for real. It was like something hit me. We aren't extremely close but she unknowingly got me through the hardest time in my life. I owe her everything. 
That was when I decided I will not die. Ever. No matter how unappealing the concept of living became.

It's been a month. 

A teacher at my high school helped me realize what I achieved and that I should be proud of myself. I'm not a native English speaker but I taught myself English in 3 years and by the time I was 15 I was at level C1. She showed me that it's OK to be proud of the things I did. And for the first time, I believed her.
After starting my antidepressants everything slowly got clearer and brighter. 
I even got a friend at school! An actual friend that wants to talk to me! She sometimes laughs at the fact that I say ""thank you"" every time she agrees to go somewhere with me but I'm just so happy and surprised that I'm talking to people.
I never thought I could be this happy. I feel like I'm 12 again, happy with friends, going out. I never thought it was possible to get out of the lowest of the lows.

It's still not perfect but it's definitely enough for now. I'm still not in a safe situation when it comes to my sexuality, but I have support from my roommate, who likes to give me tough love from time to time, from my English teacher who's an absolute sweetheart, my friend from school who likes me for who I am, my online friend who's probably reading this right now (love you bitch) and my cats who are the sweetest and most annoying creatures ever.

It will be my first time to put pomade on, shirt covered and tie cuffed, and walk into a room where people will talk to me, judge me and compare myself with others. I am feeling excited. And although I am still not in the best shape in terms of the professional knowledge, I am more than willing to give it a go. In the end, there are still people out there who would like to talk to me and maybe, by a slight chance offer me an opportunity to work.

The world may look grim to you, my dear friends, but there is always light somewhere ahead you. By all my heart, I wish you a good day, and a better tomorrow.

1692892513.0,"How do I explain my burnout to ""youre just lazy"" people?","Not only burnout, I also have depression. I'm 23.

I don't have a job. I could theoretically work a job, but I would not perform well at the job at all and possibly get fired for being unproductive, it would also do more harm than good to me. But the main reason I don't have a job is because a job would drain my time and energy, which I desperately need to work on my physical and mental health and also my to-do list at home, I just cannot handle any more responsibilities currently. Its too much, im already fighting a battle 24/7 and I do not wanna attempt to work even harder than what is physically possible.

So now I often get judged ""you are 23 why dont you have a job??"" or ""you should be studying""

""you should"" ""why dont you"" but when I reply that I don't have time and energy for a job or whatever they want me to do, they reply that I'm just lazzy and privileged.

I guess that someone who has always been mentally healthy cannot understand what it feels like to be unmotivated, to be physically tired or mentally, to have a brain that does not function well, to wake up tired even after 9 hours of sleep.

How am I supposed to reply to those ""you are lazy"" people?",mentalhealth

I can attest that it felt really good. And I’m very proud of myself taking this one step to help myself.  And this was after more than a year of literally just staying home. Wearing pajamas.  Feeling like I lost myself. But after today, I can see a glimpse of the woman I want to be.

1606424634.0,Self-care is not participating when you don’t want to.," There  is power in standing up for yourself and sticking to your personal  boundaries regarding how you participate in life as a trauma survivor. I  hate the constant barrage of showing up because of obligation. Fuck  that. I mean, when I think about the fact that people will shame you  over not doing something that you don’t want to do, I get irate. I think  about how many times in our lives that we are put in the position of  showing up due to social constructs, and I want to smash my face into  the wall. **You don’t owe anyone your time or sanity.**

I  implore you to please take care of yourself over the next few weeks  starting today. The number one thing that people healing trauma can do  is to say no or to say nothing at all. You don’t have to go to family  gatherings and events where past abusers are present. You don’t have to  go to work get-togethers because you are in recovery, and Tom can’t have  just one drink. You don’t have to go to the hundreds of things you are  invited to. Why? Because you are a goddamn adult, and you have the  choice here. No one is going to force you into a car, to put the key in  the ignition, drop the gear to D, and hit the road. If I’m wrong about  that, we have much more severe problems on our hands.

Creating agency as a trauma survivor

Look,  here is the deal. We are used to putting our needs secondary as CPTSD  survivors. At some point, our needs got put on the back burner as a  survival mechanism. That is OK. We can acknowledge that. However, as we  move forward, we must follow our gut instinct and listen to what our  soul tells us. If everything in you is screaming, **don’t go,** then don’t go. And don’t tell me that it’s easy said than done because you are in control. Y-O-U.

You  have the power here, and look, I know that is scary, but it’s true. You  can step into your personal boundaries, and your right as a human being  is that you only have to do what you want to do. I trust that the truth  of our healing journey recognizes that we are allowed to have agency in  our lives.

I challenge you to  continue to double-down on your personal boundaries and your right to  say no. Hell, start today. No law states you must suffer through another  family thanksgiving with your narcissistic mother, verbally abusive  step-father, racist grandmother, or anyone in between. Today, if you  need to say no, please say no. Order Pad Thai; it’s better than turkey  anyway.

Until next time my friend…

1613954556.0,How do I(22F) get over the trauma that a kid(9F) put me through?,"I know I sound like a wimp, but keep reading.

I am an mental health tech, and my job is to basically be a glorified babysitter for special needs kids. I'm good at my job, but something last night makes me start shaking when I think about it. 

One of my clients scares me. I don't know her exact problem, but her father told me that her mother had done dope and drank alcohol when she was pregnant with her. 

This girl was throwing a tantrum after we left a pet store. She insisted that she held cats (which we couldn't because covid.) First she whined, then she cried, then she snapped. I had to call her mother, and we stayed on the phone with her to get her to leave the pet store, literally one step at a time. 

When we got to the car, she began *screaming* at the top of her lungs that she wanted my tablet to play games on. I wouldn't let her, because she already threatened to break it. This lasted for twenty minutes. I drove with her, another client, and my shadower(new hire in training), to the highway. The girl suddenly stopped screaming, unbuckled herself, and got up next to me while I was driving 70mph. She leaned against me, and told me that I was ugly, had no friends, deserved to die, and would kill me if I let her. She began reaching for the wheel all slowly and dramatically like she was going to yank it into the oncoming traffic from my left side. The shadower yanked her back, but she kept lunging for the wheel, trying to make us crash into the other cars. I eventually pulled over on the side of the highway and called her mom. The girl then opened the car door and tried to run out into the field, saying that she was going to get us in trouble for losing her. We dragged her back into the car, and put on the child lock. She didn't like that, and tried to fight us once we got settled again. When her mom finally came, she started acting all nice, denying everything that happened. She took the child home, and we took the other client home.

I forgive this girl, because she has a mental illness and couldn't control herself. Yet, I can't stop shaking, and I couldn't sleep that night because I kept dreaming about deadly car crashes. Car crashes are one of my biggest fears, I cant help but feel terrified when I even think about getting in one. I get genuinely scared when I picture her in my mind, and deep down I want her dead. 

I will have to see her again, only time I will be prepared. How do I get over this fear that causes me to black out, start trembling, and cant form words correctly?

1607191990.0,"If your compassion doesn't include yourself, it's incomplete - be as kind and understanding to yourself as you would be to a friend who is suffering","Compassion is something we find easy when we think of someone we love. But what about someone you find annoying or don’t like? If you think about someone you’ve met who wasn’t very nice to you, or someone that was rude or did something you didn’t agree with, you might ask the question why would you feel compassion for someone who behaves this way. 

The importance of compassion isn’t only to relieve suffering and make the world a better place, it’s to free yourself from your own suffering - your sadness, your anxiety and particularly your anger. When you see the suffering of others in their behaviour it helps to reduce your own resentments.

But where we can really struggle is feeling compassion towards ourselves; when we’re suffering we sometimes punish ourselves more for not being good enough. Compassion begins with yourself - when you let go of the idea of who you think you need to be and accept yourself as you are it’s an act of kindness that allows you to start to let go of suffering.

1575154056.0,Has anyone else had depression and other mental illnesses for so much of your life that you feel like it's part of your identity and as much as you hate it you can't imagine yourself without it?,"I'm 29. At age 13 I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and about six months ago I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I also get anxiety attacks sporadically but never been diagnosed with anxiety to my knowledge. The first time I had mental health problems I was four or five years old. I got put into a psychiatric hospital for a week when I was five (don't want to get too much into why I was put in but basically I had extreme trouble regulating my emotions), and it was at that point that I internalized the thought (or message I thought I was getting) that I was bad and wrong and messed up. A year later my mom died from cancer and I thought I had made her sick because I stressed her out too much from being ""bad"". So again my vision of myself as a bad person was heavily internalized and confirmed. Then I went through bullying and teasing at school from age 8 to 12 because I was fat (from comfort eating because of losing my mom) and awkward and every demeaning thing the bullies said just confirmed my belief in myself being a disgusting ugly embarrassing pathetic piece of trash. Around age 10 was the first time I wanted to die. Age 13 I was hospitalized again for being suicidal. I've been on about 10-12 various medications (at different times) since I was 13 trying to treat my mental health. I have done probably 10 years of weekly therapy appointments. And despite all that nothing helped me 100% or even 50%. I still was depressed and anxious, I developed an eating disorder that went in and out of my life for 10 years, I still hated myself and had very low self-esteem and self-injured and felt suicidal and just...dark.

At 29 I still feel like I'm just destined to be this way. My biological father died from alcoholism after having it for about 35 years and he also had been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder recently before he died. My mother's side of the family had depression and anxiety and food addiction. I just feel like I'm destined to be and stay mentally ill. And I feel like it's part of my identity. Ever since my mom died I've gone through life feeling isolated and different from everyone else around me. I feel I'm just a broken person and I've felt it so long I really internalized it at a very early age. I know it sounds ridiculous but since the dark, self-hating, self-sabotaging thoughts are all I have known for practically all my life, they are.... comforting to me in a strange way. It feels.... right? to just wrap myself up in a blanket of sadness and turn my back on the world. I can't see myself being any other way. I feel like it's formed my personality? I'm not really sure. I just... at this point in my life I can see how not fixing my depression and other issues will leave my life in ruins and possibly end with me dead by suicide or reckless behavior, or long-term hospitalized. Obviously neither of those I would like, but another part of me feels indifferent to that happening. Like, ""...meh, you're a piece of shit and so messed up anyways, you're just another human out of the billions of others contributing to the demise of this planet so it really wouldn't be a big deal and would be better in the long run.""

I'll end here before I continue rambling on. Basically, I feel like being mentally ill is embedded into my DNA and is in every part of me and I can't find the motivation to try to change it or even the belief that I deserve that change or that it will even ever happen. Additionally I feel like I have no idea who I would be without it. Has anyone felt this? Can anyone relate?",mentalhealth
1569544837.0,"Six months after my suicide attempt, I’m traveling alone and loving life.","Almost exactly six months ago, I tried to take my life. I was misdiagnosed with MDD but after my attempt and hospitalization was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was put on new medication, started therapy, moved to a new apartment and generally hit the reset button on my life.

Now, I’m traveling Europe alone for the first time. I’m doing what I want when I want, meeting new people, seeing things I never thought I’d see, and loving every minute of it. Every second I think about the fact that I could have not had this opportunity. I could have cut my life short and never been to Europe, never felt the freedom of standing at the top of a waterfall in Iceland or on the River Thames in London. 

I’m so thankful that I made the call before it was too late, and that I had people in my corner when I woke up in the emergency room that cold March morning. I’m glad that I chose life, despite how hard it can be, how cloudy and dark and hopeless it is at times. I’m glad that I sought help and got the help that I needed.

I still feel hopeless and lost and miserable sometimes. We all do. But I want every person here to take a deep breath before they consider ending their short, beautiful life too soon. You never know what more there is to see and feel and experience. I love myself now, and I love you all.

Cheers xx

Edit: Thank you all for your support! I wanted to clarify that I wasn’t meaning to brag or seem like I just dropped everything and hopped on a plane. I actually planned this trip back in January, before my attempt, which perhaps makes it even more profound. I was tempted to cancel the trip during my treatment and recovery, but after six months I’m finally trusting myself again and feeling connected to myself and the world around me. Getting on the plane felt terrifying, but I’m so glad I went through with something that is good for me mentally, emotionally and spiritually. It’s a chance to sit with my thoughts and take in the world around me. My Eurotrip can be your anything—going somewhere new or sitting in a park you pass everyday.

1588772128.0,We need to change the way we talk about anxiety and depression.,"
I think we need to change the name of anxiety and also depression so that they sound as serious as they are. So many people just completely brush off these serious mental health issues because they are so common. Thinking that ‘feeling depressed’ or a bit ‘anxious’ is the same as a full blown mental illness. Telling someone you have depression or anxiety feels like it has the same impact, as telling someone you have a cold. 
It needs to be talked about in a more serious manner so that people suffering from these sometimes life ruining mental illnesses don’t have to be ashamed. 
Pretty much every person i have spoke to who has or did have clinal depression (including myself) say that they often feel guilty, they have thoughts similar too “other people have it so much worse than me” or “im just over exaggerating.” This is not how things should be. People shouldn’t have to feel bad for being in pain. Think about it this way, you dont see a guy with a broken leg feeling guilty about having broke his leg. No, he goes to the doctors, gets help, lets it heal and will likely receive get well soon letters from family or friends. Why does the same not happen with a broken mind?
If everyone in a community can realise how serious anxiety and depression actually is, then they can empathise with those who suffer, helping MILLIONS of people who’s lives are a constant struggle, to at least feel a little bit more understood, accepted by their peers and less guilty. That to me, would be a massive step in the right direction ❤️

1594815208.0,"Being lonely in the 21st Century where we are living in a super-connected world is fricking hard, mentally taxing and it burns me out","To avoid getting into the details, I have to build a thick wall around myself because I have been struggling with multiple mental health issues for pretty much all my life.

But slowly and surely, I have been gathering strategies, techniques and other methods on how to deal with them, even though the amount of effort and time that it took me was way longer than I waited for them to be and I still have a lot stuff to delve into in order to master these strategies.

Over the years, I have been learning how to break that thick wall that I built over the years and slowly creep into the dark unknown and face these demons and even face the real world due to that my experiences has left me with a scared and scarred image of the world.

But for some reason, dealing with loneliness is perhaps one of the most exhausting, nerve-wrecking and humiliating war that I had to fight through.

I am well aware that loneliness is not easy to deal with - it is a mentally tricky thing to face and counter and can lead to so many other traps and other complications and difficulties that you sometimes become stuck in a maze or a in a super-thick and sticky web of different threads with different poisons slowly sucking away what is left of your blood, soul and health.

It is a double-edged sword that you want to get out of this invisible prison but at the same time, the prison is also your only ""home"" and walking out of it is very scary and the fear of being rejected, even if you try to be as friendly as possible, is very tough to overcome.

&#x200B;

The person few years, I had to really pull myself from my bootstraps to overcome the traps of loneliness - the fear of being rejected, the neediness of attention and the appropriate social skills for different situations.

Yet for some reason, as much as the world of today *should* be able to allow me to use the resources that we use today like social media to my advantage to reach out but in reality, it is often the opposite!!

&#x200B;

I know that social media is a big joke and a trap of itself where behind every smile and photo of the last party, dinner or get away that you want to hides a dark thing that you do not want to share to the rest of the world.

Yet at the same time, seeing the sheer amount of photos and posts where I see smiles and even laughs with other people, friends or even random strangers, it makes me feel angry and pathetic with myself, desperate to do something about it.

I reached out plenty of times with other people but more often than not, communication in the 21st Century makes us more alien than connecting to one another.

It is super easy to ghost someone nowadays or leave a seen without even giving a clear reason why or giving the cold shoulder because the person you are talking to is simply a stranger or you do not like for no reason whatsoever. I constantly feel that I do not know where I am with another person. It is humiliating and nerve-wracking and it burns me out. It makes me feel pitiful, petty, little. It makes me feel less of a human being and like I am being passively-aggressively bullied.

&#x200B;

Yet it is also pretty hilarious that the technology of today is supposed to make us more connected yet it makes it too easy to push people away. 

Why is it common to leave only seen almost after every message? Why not just speak from the heart? Or just say a word? Anything

I feel humiliated and angry and constantly going through a thick and mighty storm every day to keep myself sane throughout this process and it feels like I am going around in circles or walking inside a maze where I have no idea where I am going.

I know that loneliness is also in my head (even though my mind and body have real reactions to the feeling) but this feeling is incredibly overwhelming and when I try to reach out, nobody is available or I have to be very careful of what to say to others as though I am walking on eggshells because of random excuses like being busy or unavailable and/or whatever excuse they can think of to avoid contact",mentalhealth

1597772760.0,The medical system in the United States is awful.,"I have been diagnosed with seven different things throughout my life.
Borderline personality disorder, anxiety, depression, insomnia, EDNOS, psychosis, and most recently ADHD.
I had most of these conditions for all of my life, but due to my parents never believing i was ill, and the shitty medical system in America, i haven't gotten the proper treatment.
My ADHD is my biggest struggle right now. It's only gotten worse and worse as i've gotten older, and now, the hyperactivity and inattention is destroying my life and makes me feel like i'm crawling out of my skin daily. 
I was finally able to start looking into therapy and medication options for my ADHD all the way back in March. It's August, and i still have not been put on medication. I did start therapy recently, and it can be helpful, but seems like she doesn't give a fuck about me most of the time. 
My treatment has been consistently put off and scheduled to a later date. Obviously, due to my mental problems i'm very impatient, so this has made it ten times worse.
It's like the fucking medical system is mocking me.
""Oh you have a severe case of ADHD, as well as other unmanaged mental illnesses? Let's make you wait over half a year to get treatment, that'll be great for you.""

1630429717.0,I don’t give a shit if someone is “faking” anxiety/depression.,"Disclaimer: this isn’t targeted at any one individual or group, but rather a school of thought that seems to have penetrated everyday discourse surrounding mental health. If I say “you” or “you people”, I’m referring to people who subscribe to the bullshit thinking I’m about to outline. This was meant to be posted to r/unpopularopinion but got deleted, so I figured y’all could appreciate my sentiment instead.

It seems like whenever I see a post about mental health (outside of subs that are directly related to the concept), the same point comes up.

*”DuH… like 90% of people who say they have depression are just faking it for attention! All those kids on TikTok just want to LARP as Billie Eilish and pretend they have a mental illness so they can be trendy!!”*

Just, stop. And I say this as someone with *diagnosed* depression, anxiety and ADHD. Here’s why this way of thinking is complete and utter **horse shit**.

First off, depression/anxiety are *incredibly* common, and exist on a wide spectrum of severity. When people see someone who claims they’re depressed, but still manages to go to work/school without many problems, they automatically jump to the thought of “oh well they seem to be doing pretty well. they’re not *really* depressed.”

This is such bullshit because unless you’ve advanced science by 5 decades and figured out how to read someone else’s thoughts, you don’t know what the fuck they’re going through. Even if that “normal” person seems functional, there’s no telling what’s going on in their head. 

You think everyone who has “real” depression is a lifeless sack of garbage who sits in bed crying all day? Guess what, there’s probably a handful of people at your job/in your class that have “real” depression. They just hide it well because that’s what people with mental health issues *have to do* in order to succeed.

Second, on the flip side of the coin, *so many* people assume the complete opposite. “This person has depression and ADHD, but doesn’t take care of themselves and can’t hold down a job without breaking down? God, another faker, huh? That’s not mental illness, that’s *laziness*”.

Like, *what the fuck is wrong with you???* That’s literally what severe mental illness does to you? If “depression” can’t exist if you’re doing well on the surface, and it *also* can’t exist if you’re doing terribly on the surface, then what the hell do you think depression is!?

But even putting aside the obvious lack of understanding regarding mental health, it’s *still* fucked up to call someone out as a “faker”.

Look at it this way, let’s say someone actually *is* faking it. They post on social media claiming they have depression, but they actually don’t.

*WHO FUCKING CARES?*

Even if they don’t have a diagnosed mental illness, they clearly aren’t getting the attention they need outside of social media. And since when is asking for attention a bad thing? Most of the people who receive these complaints are *literally children.* You think that if a fucking *child* is resorting to random strangers online for support, there’s absolutely *nothing* wrong with them? And they *don’t* need people to hear them out? Of fucking course not!!

And here’s the biggest problem. WHO ARE WE TO DECIDE WHETHER SOMEONE IS FAKING OR NOT?

Mental illness transcends class, race and gender. Nobody is immune from chronic depression/anxiety. 99% of the time you *cannot fucking tell* if someone has a mental illness or not. Because it’s a **M E N T A L** illness. 

So why take the chance on saying “oh they’re just lying for attention”, when there’s a strong possibility that they’re serious and you’re just making it worse by making them feel like an impostor?

Seriously, what does anyone stand to gain from calling someone out for “faking it”? 

“Oh, but the more people who fake it, the more stigma there will be against people who have *actual* mental illness.”

Bull. Shit. Where do you think that stigma is coming from? Because it sure as fuck isn’t coming from people who actually care about mental health.

It’s coming from people like you, who refuse to believe that mental illness can affect *everyone*. No mental health professional, or doctor, or caring person is shutting these people down. It’s just people like you. The resources to treat mental health are always available, but people who need them aren’t getting them because they’re constantly told that they’re making it worse for people who have “real” mental illness.

And one more thing.

“Oh you probably self-diagnosed, didn’t you? That means your mental illness isn’t real.”

Oh, fuuuuuuck off.

First of all, how do you think you get a diagnosis in the first place? You think a doctor is gonna come to your house, take one look at you and say “yep, you’ve got depression”. That’s not how it works! You get a diagnosis by recognizing symptoms within yourself, condensing them and narrowing it down to a few possibilities, then bringing that info to a professional when/if you can. This process is known as, you guessed it, **self-diagnosis**.

And what about people who *can’t* get diagnosed? I’m lucky enough to live in a place where mental health is taken seriously and covered by insurance. So, I was able to be diagnosed and treated from a young age.

What about people who aren’t so lucky? In the US, you can pay up to $500 for an initial consultation. Not everyone can afford that. And in some countries, mental health treatment is a fucking joke.  It’s chocked up to weakness or insanity sometimes, so good luck getting a diagnosis in one of those places. And actually getting a prescription for meds? That’s a whole other mountain to climb, even in more progressive countries.

So if you’re in an area where getting a diagnosis is next to impossible, what are you supposed to do? Just sit there feeling miserable and telling no one because you “might be faking it”? Fuck no, you get online and do what you can to find support and raise awareness for others in your situation.

Bottom line, nobody knows what mental illnesses someone else is or isn’t dealing with. And even if you do, why the hell do you care?

You’re not helping anyone. You’re not saving resources for people who “actually” need them. All you’re doing is making everybody feel worse.",mentalhealth

1553617722.0,"Does anyone else hate how people throw around the terms ""narcissist"" and ""sociopath"" on Reddit?","Narcissistic personality disorder is a horrible, painful condition. It's a mental disorder that, just like any, ruins the lives of people who never wanted to be this way. Like other personality disorders it takes away someone's control over their own thoughts and behaviours and twists their perceptions of the world around them. They've quite often been through abuse which has led them to develop their condition, and often they aren't even able to see that there's anything wrong - just like in other psych conditions.

Sociopathy hasn't even been considered a real diagnosis for decades. The closest thing is antisocial personality disorder, which is another horrible condition that people are forced to live with. It damages someone's ability to empathise and feel positive emotions, their ability to control strong bursts of anger or sadness and to properly deal with their emotions, and it makes people struggle to control impulsive behaviour and fit in with society. Someone with ASPD isn't the stoic, emotionless killer from a horror film or the cool, charismatic, cunning CEO. In fact they're very often poor and not too clever, having grown up in toxic environments and never getting the support they need to develop properly.

Both of these conditions are extremely complex and very, very hard to identify and diagnose, even for an experienced psychiatrist sitting across from their patient.

Reddit uses these terms the way people used ""retarded"" a decade ago. People have taken crippling conditions that they know fuck all about beyond watching slasher films and Dr Phil, and turned them into slurs.

It's even worse just how readily people make these armchair diagnoses. Whenever anyone does something bad, they must be a *sociopath!* It couldn't just be that normal people like you and me sometimes do bad things for a variety of very complex reasons - no, they must be a sociopath (and that means monster!)

Whenever a /r/relationship_advice or /r/amitheasshole post describes someone doing something that could even just be interpreted as slightly unreasonable, or a slight overreaction, they're a TOXIC NARCISSIST! No, they didn't just snap because they've been under a lot of stress like any human can, they dont just seem unreasonable because we don't know what's going on in their head and know their side of the story. No, they're a NARCISSIST! And it seems *everyone* on Reddit knows at least one narcissist, usually more.


And how do you deal with someone who has a debilitating mental health condition? You cut them out of your life completely! After all, they're toxic and they'll ruin your life if you let them!

Lately I've been noticing that after social interactions I can't stop thinking about the ways I ""messed up"". And even though I'm able to convince myself logically that it wasn't that bad and that people don't hate me for it, I keep thinking that they just pretend to like me and secretly think I'm a terrible person.

I can't stop beating myself up over minor mistakes and I try to distract myself from these thoughts, but they always come back and then they won't leave me alone. I've talked to others and asked for their assessment of the situation that I currently can't stop thinking about and they reassure me that it's not that bad which helps for a while but then I go back to thinking that I made a horrible mistake and people are lying to me when they say it's okay.

This happens with things that happened years ago or when I was a child, too. It's keeping me up at night, it makes me feel physically sick, it makes it hard to eat and makes me angry because I'm trying to get better, I'm trying to put myself out there and overcome my fears but as soon as I'm alone with my thoughts it backfires.

in the last time I'm again at a very low point of my life and deep depression.

I know it's not always the whole reality they show there, it's only the best part they post often with big theatre to have a worthy post. That's life today. Still I feel so bad seeing other people being with other people together having fun which remembers me that I should do the same but I'm not able to have much joy due to my depression and social anxiety. Then I feel guilty and worthless.

Who else here has the same experiences? Did anyone of you quit or at least ignore instagram for a time and saw definite positive improvements in their mental health?

But that's no problem for me, WhatsApp & Instagram is enough of the always online always having to present the perfect life bullshit.

I would love to read about your experiences and suggestions! Much love to everyone with depression, it's only the brain telling us false things and emotions. It's not reality.

1666045608.0,33 m. I had sex with my therapist after two years of being treated for Borderline Personality Disorder.,"So this is a long one. Going to try and keep it short, and be available to answer questions.

Two years ago, with nearly 20 years of mood swings, sadness, anger, substance abuse, and hyper sexual behaviors behind me, I decided it was time to get help. My wife of 8 years was asking for a divorce, and my life had become unmanageable.

I started seeing a psychologist through the VA. I’m an army veteran. She turned out to be a specialist in BPD and after some time was able to diagnose me. I had always suspected either BPD or Bipolar. 

We’ve worked together for about 2 years and have made amazing progress. She leads a Dialectic Behavioral Therapy group that worked wonders for me. It was life changing. Emotional intelligence, mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, and distress tolerance are all part of my life now. I’m not perfect, and I’m always willing to put in the work, but life is better than ever before. I truly feel like my BPD is in recession. I also recently got sober, which helps a lot.

So this last February my wife and I separated. This is primarily due to my unstable moods, anger issues, substance abuse, and hyper sexuality. I moved into my own place and it took months to stabilize and get into a healthy and productive routine.

My last appointment with my therapist, I mentioned that I understood I was in a vulnerable situation and I was taking dating very cautiously. Being roughly 70 days sober, not completely over my ex, and prone to emotional dependency, I need to really consider my actions and emotions. I’m in a vulnerable place where I could relapse in a few different ways.

Well two days after that she texts me at 11:30 pm and starts flirting with me. She’s never texted me before and acknowledged how risky it was to do so.

She even mentioned the fact that I said I was vulnerable, and stated she felt vulnerable as well.

I at first told her I wasn’t available because I had gone on a date with a new girl and wanted to give that my full attention while I figured out where it was going. Also, I’m not attracted to this woman.

Another day goes by and I can’t fight the curiosity. I started texting her and just soaked up the attention what felt sexually deviant. Asking her about why she likes me. What she’s into. What she would do to me. What she wants me to do to her.

Here’s the thing. I have a history periods of being sexually involved with people who I’m not attracted to because I like the attention, I like being used, and I like things that feel taboo. I almost always end up feeling ashamed and disgusted by my behavior when this happens. And this woman, more than anyone knows all of that about me. 

Well two nights after she texted me for the first time, I went over to her place to give her what she wanted. She didn’t pressure me to, so we were both consenting, but it doesn’t feel good now. I almost immediately realized I wasn’t into what I was doing, but I stayed and kept doing things until I got her off. Then I left.

Looking back on it, it feels a little predatory. Here’s the person I’ve been most honest with about my hyper sexual episodes and how they’ve always made me feel bad. And I end up getting baited into just that. 

I’m not going to report her. At this point I should have better control over myself. But I’m disappointed in both of us.

I’ve since asked her to refer me to a new therapist. She did so happily and respectfully, and the new one feels like a great fit. 

There ya go.

EDIT:

I want to thank everyone for the overwhelming response to this post. I have to admit, I was honestly struggling with whether or not I should feel bad about this situation. It’s pretty clear now that what she did was wrong. Had the cards not been so stacked in her favor, she’s definitely not someone I would’ve been intimate with.

So here’s the update, and I’ll say at the beginning that many people are going to be less than satisfied. I reached out to her and told her exactly how I feel about what happened, how it was manipulative and I’m left feeling used. She seemed to be apologetic and understanding as to why I felt that way. I say “seemed” because to be brutally honest I don’t know if this is a one time fuck up, or a calculated cruel person just doing her thing. Of course when you get called out on doing something wrong, you say whatever it takes to deescalate the situation. So who the fuck knows. 

I want to preface this next part with my feelings of how to support people dealing with abuse, trauma, and the like. I think it’s important to make yourself available to listen, offer support, and support them in finding closure, however they deem necessary. I’ve had friends who were assaulted and didn’t report it, and I tried to understand that it’s their closure to find, not mine.

She said I’d be well within my rights to report this, if I decided to do so. I’m not planning on reporting her. I’m not blaming myself for what happened, but again it’s not uncommon for me to get myself into situations I regret like this. I’ve expressed how I feel about it, I’m choosing to believe that she is sorry and remorseful (choosing because again, I’ll never really know) and I’m moving on. It’s not fair to be taken advantage of, but I also don’t feel like it’s fair for me to be the one who has to report this and take on that process. 

Go easy on me, but this is where I’m at with it. Who knows, I may end up feeling differently about it in the future. Hell even as I write this I’m thinking “did she ever care about my well being? She never contacting me outside of a meeting to check on me. Even after I’d cry in a meeting and tell her I don’t know what to do, and I couldn’t fix my life, I couldn’t control myself. She never texted. It was only when she wanted sex that she went there”. Yeah. Idk. That’s where I’m at. Sorry to let y’all down. 

Thanks again for the validation and support.",mentalhealth

1542903191.0,"Mental illness isn’t a choice, we don’t wake up one day and say “Hey you know what?! I want to start hearing voices in my head. That sounds like a great idea! Let’s throw in some anxiety and a dash of depression while we’re at it!”","Living with a mother who has a mental illness, caused me to have a lot of resentment and anger as a child. It has also caused me to have my own issues with anxiety and depression. 

My mom had her own business and was very successful. When I was 8 we had a flood in our house that completely destroyed her business. I didn’t know it at the time, but she started doing heavy drugs. She would constantly pass out and not eat for days. 

At 8, I was no longer a child but a parent. I remember going into our kitchen to cook food so she would eat and seeing pipes and burnt spoons on the counter. As a teenager she would trick me into thinking that we could practice driving so I could get my license. When in reality, she would be flagging people down the street asking if they had any drugs she could buy. Few years later, she was put in a psychiatric hospital. She had called the police telling them to stop following her and bugging her house. She was arrested and placed in a psychiatric facility and diagnosed with schizophrenia. She was later court ordered to stay in a half way house. After her time was up, she decided that she never needed help and was able to walk out freely without anyone stopping her. 

Anosognosia has serious consequences. I’ve watched my family members step away from her like the plague because they became so angry with her that she wouldn’t admit that she needed help or believed that she was doing it on purpose for attention. They convinced themselves that she would somehow “snap out of it.” 

Here’s my main point in all of this, if a person does not think that they need help they will NOT get treatment. In coping with my own mental issues, forcing anyone to do something they hate is far worse for our mental health. Instead of fighting it, accept it for what it is  Stop putting these expectations on us that are unrealistic. Sometimes we don’t need help in the way you think is best. We don’t need further rejection or guilt. Most times we just need support. We need love.",mentalhealth

Hear me out:

Yes, of course it’s a choice when life is going well for you because your baseline is already happy. It”s actually EASY to choose happiness when you’re already happy.

But when you are facing a hardship in life or you are feeling depressed- You are not waking up to sunshine and rainbows and butterflies everyday. Choosing happiness might not be in the cards for you when you’re struggling just to make it through the day. And that might not seem fair, especially when you see the people around you enjoying life and living so lightly.

But believe it or not, the struggles you are faced with are fair because in the end they are a damn GIFT. It may not feel like it now, it feels horrible and heartbreaking and hopeless. But slowly but surely each day will get better and you will get through it and become a stronger person.

But I am seeing all these perfectly normal individuals talking about their experiences with mental illness mainly because of their family members. What am I supposed to feel?! That our existence hindered their career progression and made their lives miserable? I had enough guilty feeling because of my mom. I can even recognize one of the guest speakers.

When I was released I made a promise to myself if I didn't have my life together or something to live for by my 24th birthday, I would kill myself on that day.
And today is my birthday. I don't have my life together, I live in transitional housing for homeless women, I have a dead end job as a barista, a shit car that is constantly breaking down.

1603159811.0,"After more than 2 years working on a relationship with a person suffering with mental illness, I can say I've reached a place where we both feel deeply happy and in love"," I have a 2 year long relationship with someone diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder. Things have been very hard in the past, but right now, I feel really happy on my relationship and I do envision a long term future with this person. I don't exactly know why I am writing this, but since I feel like sharing a little of my story with the world, I thought it might be useful to someone to read my statement about my experience and journey to where I am now.

Things were really hard in the beginning. My partner was very unstable and deeply depressed, simple things like sleeping or eating were herculean tasks to him that demanded a lot. Huge anxiety was easily triggered, that led to paranoid and intrusive thoughts, specially at night. Sometimes it lasted a couple of days, sometimes it lasted weeks, or a month. I really felt like on the more ""happy"" and stable days I had to take the best advantage out of it so that he felt like ""coming back"" from the pit hole was worth it. I felt like every time we cycled back into a depressive episode he was further and further away from me. I knew I couldn't really do much more than support him and maintain the bare minimum communication he allowed me to have with him but I just kept insisting and insisting because I thought that if I stopped doing so he would just detach completely from everything and everyone.

It was rough. Sometimes the emotional distance between us was so big that I thought I was in love with a man that would never love me. I felt neglected emotionally a lot of the times because I was supporting everything I could but I couldn't really have that back because my partner was living in a ""survival"" mode. When he became more willing to share, our communication also improved, he shared more with me and I learned how to help him better and also how to help myself to not take things too personally sometimes. Also, therapy and medical treatment were of main importance for his progress of course. There's no partner that can cure an illness, it can make it less difficult, for sure, but only the right treatment can really make it better. Fast forward to nowadays my partner works a full time job with quite some responsibility, he has plans for the future with me, he's stable, for the most part, he keeps his medical and therapy appointments on check, and he's happy. I wouldn't be with anyone else but him. I'm more confident than I have ever been, for the first time I feel someone truly sees me. and values me. We're both on our early 20s and starting our careers, I hope we can move in together in the near future, of course there are still bad times, but I do think we are more prepared now to manage the hard times.

I love him deeply, I'm so so proud of him for overcoming so much and that he's no longer suicidal. I am beyond happy he hang on long enough to embrace the person he's becoming and let himself love and be loved too. There's no better feeling in the world than just laying on his chest listening to his heart beating at night before falling asleep, I now it sounds very cheesy, but it's really the truth for me, it does feel like heaven.

If you're on a relationship going with a hard time understanding and dealing with your partner's mental health, I don't mean with this that you should stay and that you should endure all of it because I know how brutal and lonely it can be. Mental illness is devastating for the ones suffering with it, but also to others close to them. On a relationship, it can indeed became unhealthy for both parts to stay together, so, by no means I believe that the answer is always to stay. I only want to say that sometimes, it takes time and work, but things do get better, a lot better.",mentalhealth

She said I’ll never get my licence, have a job or get married because I have learning disabilities

She was my teacher from 8-10 years old.

I had her because I had inflamed ears which weren’t diagnosed until I was 6 and didn’t get fixed until 8 years old.

It gave me learning difficulties as I couldn’t hear and I needed grommets and other ear treatments performed.

I’ll never forget me telling my support teacher “I have sore ears , I can’t read this book” and she said “don’t trick me, you obviously don’t like this book I’ll get you another one” 

When she returned my ears where running blood like a tap as my ear drum perforated.

She was always so mean to me.

Learning this information made me feel really insecure, idk why my mum told me.

I’m now 31, with a licence, two degrees, I was top of the class in my latest degree, have a great job, Im married and I’m pregnant expecting my first child in my own home with my husband.

I was already building the resolve to commit suicide throughout her rant. I got hit with the typical ""you're not depressed, you're lazy"", and all the related tropes about how my situation is all my fault and anything she's doing is just in response to me ""hurting"" her by existing.

I've posted about my situation here before, and to be honest I'm extremely surprised I made it this long. But when my own mother's response to knowing I am suicidal is to tell me not to get the carpets dirty, I'm feeling like it's time to cash out.

We came to the conclusion together, that I am fed up of being judged, and wanna change that and the hypocracy in my family. I just don't know how. We agreed that fixing that will hopefully mean I dont have the need to hurt myself, or lash out involuntarily. But that's only gonna be noticeable after a while. So can't comment on that right now.

I have always found it hard to reach out for help, always worrying about being a burdon to others, even when they said they were open.

Around March I had gotten back from a class trip which I had made some friends, opened up to people, and had a great going social life, something I always struggle with. But as you know what happened in March had some different plans.

My school was closed off, the only way I had contact to these people, I had a couple friends numbers, but didn’t really see them and drifted a bit apart.

I was plunged back into a state of loneliness I felt like I had no one, I still had peoples contact info, but being autistic means I extremely struggle with reaching out. This caused me to spiral

Thoughts of un worth, fear, and trapped filled me. I was a shell.

It came to a head when after long suffering I thought, this needs to end. I walked out of my room wondering the quickest, and painless way to end it.

I looked over and saw something, my German shepherd chilling on his bean bag. I curled up on the bag and vented, cried, and he just listened.

In the end, I left the beanbag feeling as though I am worthy of life. I had already tied a noose, I had access to knives, but little drago was there.

He had no idea, he didn’t pull me out of a fire, he didn’t fight off a bear, but by just being there he saved me.

It’s been over half a year now, I’ve learned to talk more. I’ve even for the first time in a long time, invited someone out. Im now indulging in my love of bikes and engineering. I’ve healed, I’m now even starting to accept my neurodiversity and masking less.

All this improvement wouldn’t happen if the family German shepherd wasn’t sitting on the bean bag that night. He has no idea what he did.

Two days ago I had a phone call with my psychiatrist, she increased my meds again and gave me a few recommendations. Among them, she suggested I see a friend IRL. I don't have any friends in the city where I study, only an acquaintance from my marine biology courses.

Just after hanging up with my psychiatrist, I sent this acquaintance a weird message, proposing her to come over. I'm not really sure why but she accepted, and even seemed happy!

So yesterday, even if I didn't really feel like it, I cleaned my whole appartment, put on nice clothes, and I even went grocery shopping (I usually hate that, it drains too much of the few energy I have lol).

She came on the afternoon. We made some snacks together, and ate them watching a movie. I had feared a lot it would be awkward because we don't know each other a lot, but it was really fun!

I was super exhausted after that (and went directly to sleep at 6pm, oops), but also super glad I did it!

1589281781.0,Driving around for hours listening to Nine Inch Nails and getting pulled over by the military police has been an oddly enlightening experience.,"I'd even go so far as to say spiritual, and I do *not* consider myself spiritual or religious (anymore).

I was feeling like shit today, borderline suicidal, and since I'm living with my parents for the time being, I had to get out of the house to feel through my emotions in private. And it was just... the most compelling feeling of peace I've experienced in a long time. Something about the music throbbing while I drove through a really heavy fog, only car on the road, with the streetlights glowing pretty colors through the mist, just got my thoughts flowing freely again.

I won't jump the gun and say I'm cured, but I did just resist some self destructive habits once I got home, and I'm now doing the coursework that I've been putting off at risk of failing out of school because I *just. didn't. have the energy for it*... So even if I wake up next week and I'm worse off and I feel silly for being optimistic, at least I got a precious window of peace and lucidity that helped me to at least pass the semester.

Oh, and getting pulled over! So, I was so absorbed with my thoughts, I was doing the drive on autopilot thing - see and react to things like red lights and sudden movements, but not really think about where I'm going. I was just navigating by instinct and I ended up going too far on a road and heading for the military base just outside town. Turns out, military cops don't really like it when you suddenly show up to their gates in the middle of the night with a car full of mysterious boxes (haven't fully unpacked yet), then suddenly freak out, turn around, drive on the wrong side of the road for a minute, then correct yourself and try to leave thinking nobody saw you being silly and stupid.

Anyway, the guy that immediately pulled me over was... just a really, really genuine human. He asked me how my night was going and I just explained the whole thing, the need to get out and clear my head, the reason I was too distracted to see the big ass signs about it being a military base (that's also due to the fog, it was incredibly thick, in my defense). Sounded like an absolute nervous wreck. And he listened. And he was really empathetic, just letting me off with a warning.

The funny thing is, I spent a while beating myself up, thinking ""man, this guy must think I'm some huge kind of stupid weak kid. He's a responsible ass adult, working a job in public safety, and here he is, having to chase down a stupid kid with a panic issue. All because *I* can't properly process my feelings.""

But I considered it for a bit, and I realized that this random cop, who doesn't owe me anything, who's shift I rudely interrupted, saw me in one of my worst states and still had it in him to treat me kindly and *listen* to me. Actually *listen* to what I was going through. And I realized that I haven't been doing that for myself.

Guys, see, I need to treat myself with the same empathy and sincerity that this cop treated me with. I need to listen to myself, and forgive myself \~\~even\~\~ *especially* when I'm in my worst states. Because the only way to leave those states is with love and support, and 90% of the time, when I'm not lucky enough to have this cop around, I need to provide that love and support for myself.

My mother is an abusive POS, father was even worse before he was divorced. Routinely, I would go to over to videos on subreddits and just watch some posts there. I recently saw a post about parenting, and people in the comments all had the same general consensus that ""your child, your rules""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Problem is, no one really gets all the possible ways that this could be applied. Sure, it is usually used for logical stuff like what religion the child is associated with or maybe whether the child is a vegetarian or a meat-eater. But have you thought this saying through? You're saying that it is this person's child, and that they should be able to make the rules. You are putting this person on one of the most dangerous power trips ever. Now, what would you do if you found out this person over/underfeeds their child? What if they feed the child too much junk, or strictly healthy foods without letting them have any junk food? What would you do if, whenever the child speaks up, they shut them down and go on a tangent before mentioning ""I'm your parent!""? Now do you see where I'm coming from? Look, that was pretty much my story, so I hope you really listen to what I'm saying. I'm 15 years old and I could tell you that shit is damaging. I don't need anyone going through something similar because people keep using this idiotic statement.   


  
And yes, I know this sounds like a giant hyperbole, but it really isn't. Think about it, if you're living with the mentality that ""this is my child, I set the rules for them and no one else"" you are most likely going to turn out as an abusive/narcissistic parent. It's a terrible lesson to be spreading on these subreddits, and are most of the time not even warranted.

1561633716.0,You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?,"I remember feeling pretty smart when I was a kid. Maybe that's just how all kids feel but that's what I remember – getting better grades than most other kids. During my teenage years I didn't work very hard and still got good grades. I even got accepted into a school that only took on students that got good grades. That's when things started to change. Everyone seemed so much smarter than me and it was really scary. I went from feeling like one of the smartest guys in the room to the dumbest – and I'd let myself know just how dumb I was, beating myself up.

Soon, I wasn't just stupid, I was boring. Then I was ugly and weak and pathetic in the eyes of everyone. I felt like I was getting dumber. A brain fog had permeated my mind – I couldn't think as fast. My grades slipped as I worked even less and started playing video games more. Gaming takes up your attention and the thoughts more or less stop.

I still managed to get into a decent university but I was ashamed of my accomplishment because all my classmates were moving on to much more prestigious ones. I lasted two and a half years at uni before the suicidal thoughts started to become a real plan. Scared, friendless and far from home, I decided not to go through with it one night – the worst night of my life. Instead I called my mom late that night and early the next morning I was on a train home.

Since then, I've been living with my mom. I work as a waiter and the job sees a high staff turnover with a majority of people working there being students trying to earn some money in between their studies. I can feel them judging me when I tell them that it's all I do – I'm not doing this part time while I chase my dreams. I don't have anything else going on. I'm a 25yo man living with his mom and working a minimum wage job.

I got help, of course – talking to some professionals and taking pills – but the thoughts never really left. I know I'm not supposed to indulge them. My therapist told me, *you wouldn't say those things to your best friend so why would you say them to yourself?* I would reply that my best friend isn't trying to sabotage and fuck up my life. But I was never trying to do that and yet I felt like I deserved to hear the the things I was telling myself and deserved the life I now had because of how stupid and pathetic I was.

Recently, after doing something stupid but totally forgivable and human, I googled 'Is it possible to get dumber?' The first result was the question: *Is it psychologically possible to get dumber* on Quora. One of the answers by Norma Pellett:

> My experience tells me yes. I know a woman who was articulate and educated. I moved away and saw her again after ten years. She had no opinions of her own and couldn't articulate a decent sentence.

> I asked other friends if she had been ill or in an accident. No, she hadn't. Then I heard her husband talking to her. He called her ”stupid” and told her what she was doing was idiotic. He berated her for several more minutes. She was so cowed by this abuse that she bought into his assessment of her intelligence.
> She became what he expected her to be.
> I was too young and unsure of myself to call him on it or even to try to find a way to help her. I am ashamed that I didn't do anything.
> I'm not even sure that thirty years ago people really thought of emotional abuse as abuse. There were no bruises or broken bones, but this was much worse.
> Don't spend any time with someone who puts you down — not even if they say, “just kidding” or “can't you take a joke?” Months and years of this “humor” can destroy anyone.

Abuse is a terrible thing and I don't want to diminish it or its victims but I couldn't help but compare the husband to the voice in my head. The abuse I put myself through. I imagine having another person tell you those things is a thousand times worse.

I have always thought that a smart person was smart no matter what. That they may not believe it and people might tell them otherwise but they were, unchangeably, smart. Maybe it's obvious to everyone else but it never occurred to me that people could become the person they were told they are. That their personality could be moulded. What my therapist should have told me is *You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?* Thinking of it that way it's hard to feel like I deserve it. There is not a person in the world that I believe deserves abuse.

So how to stop? It's important not to try telling yourself the opposite of the things you usually tell yourself. I'm not going to look in the mirror every day and tell myself I'm smart, confident, handsome etc. That just feels inauthentic and quite silly. What you have to do instead is learn to recognise the thoughts and externalize them – think of them as not your own but rather your anxiety's or your depression's. Your illness is your own personal abuser. Then the next step will be to stop believing the thoughts by not giving them your attention. Don't think the opposite or try to argue with them (e.g. *I'm not ugly I'm beautiful*) instead, try to refocus on whatever it is you were doing. This is hard but can get easier with practice. Mindfulness meditations help. You can even try talking back to the thoughts as though you aren't taking them seriously, *Thanks anxiety, tell me that again! C'mon that's what you always say. Ha, that's a good one. I was hoping you were going to show up.*

1561297943.0,I think people who make jokes/say that people need to “man up” or “grow a pair” or “be a man” are part of the problem.,"


My friend tried to commit suicide last night. I watched him drive away in his car drunk and he went on the highway/motorway saying he didn’t care if he died. Tried to stop him but couldn’t. That’s not the issue though. 

I had no idea he was suicidal, his family had no idea he was suicidal, his friends had no idea. He’d kept his mouth shut and let these feelings fester. 

The conversation about male mental health is nowhere near what it needs to be. It is heading in the right direction sure, but at the moment it only seems to be a big deal when someone is on the brink of suicide or having severe depression. 

There is no emphasis on normal day to day life, people telling young boys to man up if they are upset. Saying be a man. This is vile behaviour and forces boys to stuff down their feelings and deal with it through anger since they feel they can’t talk it through. Even saying it to girls shows them that this is how they should act and that boys should act differently when it comes to feelings. 

In the US four times as many suicides are by males. 9% have daily anxiety or depression. Of those 9% only a quarter found help for it according to the national health survey 2010-13
Source: https://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/12/numbers

In the UK 76% of suicides are carried out by males and 12.5% men are affected by depression. Of the people that seek help through therapy only 36% are men. Then the most shocking stat from the UK, of all the things that kill men under 45, getting hit by a car, murder, heart attacks etc, the leading cause of death is suicide. I am an under 45 male in the UK and to know that the most likely way for me to die statistically is for me to kill myself is shocking and scary. 

Only 15% of men report they would take time off work to focus on mental health. 34% would feel embarrassed or ashamed to do so for a mental health issue compared to the 15% feeling ashamed for a physical injury. 38% would feel that their employer would look down on them for taking time off for a mental health issue compared to the 26% for a physical.

Even among my friends this sort of “man up talk” happens where if a guy gets upset over something deemed trivial he gets told to stop being a girl. I personally am quite sensitive, when I get super angry I tend to tear up. I hate it because it sometimes weakens my argument but it’s just how I am. When I get angry I tear up. It’s not a “sad cry” I’m just angry. 

 I had an argument with a close female friend and she said “I’m only joking, so stop crying and grow a pair, man up”. That says my feelings aren’t allowed because I’m male, because apparently I’m not supposed  to feel that way. I should be calm and collected at all times. But all that does is make my squash my feelings away and deal with them some other way. 

That other way can turn into depression and eventually suicide. 

We need to change the mental health conversation so that it’s not a conversation about men on the brink of suicide. I’m aware that it isn’t only aimed there but at the moment to me it feels like not enough is focused on males feeling  like they *can* talk their problems through with people.",mentalhealth

1607722945.0,I did something today that I haven't done since 2019,"I folded my laundry.

Just about one year ago, my OCD caused me to suffer (another) complete mental and emotional breakdown/collapse, culminating in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. Being in such an unstable state is one thing, but then being quarantined and unemployed made things...dark. Horrific, really. I spent every waking and sleeping moment in bed, trying to escape the confines of my own mind. I would go a week without showering, wearing the same sweats and t-shirt every day. I very nearly attempted suicide again.

Before the day I ""broke"", I had emptied my dresser and closet, and did a giant wash of almost every item of everyday wear I owned, clothes for all seasons. And for the next year, they lay in assorted baskets strewn across the laundry room, untouched and unexplored. I've started coming around to stability and normality over the past month, and today decided to finally take a step out of the darkness, and fold my god damn laundry.

And it feels amazing.

I don't mean to sound braggy or anything...I guess I just wanna say that things can better and the small victories can be really powerful and uplifting. The dark times seem eternal--but with hard work, therapy, meds, faith, support, family and friends--whatEVER aids your mental health journey--things CAN get better. Even in times such as these.

1604675002.0,My Parents Punished me for Having PTSD," I had been sexually abused by my grandfather for 3-4 years, literally all of my early childhood - I do not have a single memory before him abusing me. My parents found out after constantly punishing me for masturbating (in my room), wetting the bed, having outbursts, etc. There was legal action taken, I was in counseling for the bare minimum time. 

 I had horrible nightmares, night terrors, I sleptwalked. My parents literally punished me for getting out of bed and waking my mom (who was a stay at home mom with all of her kids being in school for 8 hours out of the day) up because I had nightmares that made me feel terrified, paralyzed, and unable to go back to sleep. 

 On one specific occasion, I remember being in the 3rd or 4th grade (only 1-2 years after the abuse had ended) and waking my mom up because I had a nightmare about dolls trying to kill me. My parents were so mad that my dad made me sleep with the light on in an attempt to make it where I couldn't sleep, when I did fall asleep that night he came in and intentionally woke me up telling me I didn't deserve to be asleep, I was going to learn a lesson about waking my mom up, and that he hoped I didn't sleep all night (I had school the next morning). On top of all of that, they made me stay home from a party that everyone else got to go to (my mom stayed home with me). When they got back my sister had brought me candy, he said I wasn't allowed to have it. He also made a point of saying how everyone asked where I was and he told EVERYONE why I couldn't be there, and he made me feel guilty for my mom not being able to go and having to stay home. 

  I confronted my mom about it today (I'm 24) and she just immediately started saying the typical, ""Oh yeah we get it, we're terrible parents, your childhood was terrible."" She then kept saying I never told them I was having nightmares even though I remember ALWAYS telling them about my nightmares and the only time I didn't get punished was the night I had a nightmare about someone shooting my family because that was deemed realistic enough to be afraid. I told her all I wanted her to do was apologize and she full out said she will never apologize and to leave her alone.

  I got frustrated and sarcastically asked if they were never told I would have PTSD after being abused my entire childhood, she said no. So I asked if they seriously didn't have enough common sense to think maybe their child was traumatized and she said no.

well my bpd symptoms got worse. instead of sulking when i am feeling self doubt or low self esteem i immediately project and lash out. this comes from a place of extreme pain and years of trauma but because it is a stark contrast to the inwardness of depression i rarely get the same attitude i did when i didn’t mention bpd symptoms. i see it constantly - no regard for anger as a mental health symptom in support communities, pointing fingers and calling the aggressive psychopathic, etc. 

people will advocate when you’re all cute and quiet and tiny and not making any noise. once your mental illness becomes external and your pain manifests into outbursts and aggression it’s completely dismissed and the person is disregarded and abandoned.

1605775373.0,A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness," 

A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness,

If you are reading this as one of **many** who doesn’t understand what it’s like to deal with mental illness, I am very happy you don’t experience firsthand what I and so many others have to experience on a daily basis because...

**I would not wish this pain on my worst enemy.**

**I am so happy** you don’t have to experience feeling that no one in your life truly loves or cares about you, despite them reassuring you that they do on almost a daily basis.

**I am so happy** you haven’t had to answer any of the further questions that follow “do you feel anxious or depressed?” when visiting the doctor’s office.

**I am so happy** you have never thought the world is better without you in it.

If you have never had to leave a party because of a sudden wave of anxiety or sadness, *I really hope it stays that way.*

If you are able to get out of bed without feeling nauseous with anxiety or the weight of depression, *appreciate it* every single day**.**

**Don’t ever take it for granted.**

Don’t let a day go by without appreciating how *beautiful* life is and can be. Because many of us, myself included, aren’t always able to see that beauty, no matter how hard we try.

While mental illness is something that is so wrongfully romanticized in the movies, **it is very ugly in real life.** Mental illness is not **“quirky”** or **“poetic”** like society makes it seem on social media.

Being mentally ill isn’t *aesthetic worthy,* mascara filled tears with sad music in the background; mental illness is barely being able to keep up basic personal hygiene because it feels almost physically **impossible** to get out of bed. 

**Mental illness makes the world seem pointless.** 

So when a loved one approaches you seeking comfort or a listening ear, please don’t automatically assume it is an annoying cry for attention. Because I promise you, that assumption is our **worst fear.**

**The last thing we wish for is to be a burden on the ones we love.**

Isn’t it ironic that even when we are struggling, our first thought is to not make our loved ones uncomfortable?

And when we cancel plans or fail to stay around the entirety of a social outing, don’t take it personally.Trust me, we already beat ourselves up for it enough already because we finally put ourselves first for once, even though that is what we should’ve been doing all along. 

When we isolate ourselves from you and push you away, don’t think it is us being rude. We are just trying to do what we can to feel like we aren’t dragging you down with us.

Please do not blame us for the cards we got dealt, we deal with them the best we are able to, even if it means pushing loved ones away to avoid getting hurt. 

Most of all, see mental illness as you would any broken bone or any physical sickness.**It hurts just as bad and is equally out of our control.**So, while we don’t wish you would first handedly understand, we want you to **be patient** and understand the best you are able to.

**We are fighting an invisible illness that we aren’t always sure we can beat.**

However, even with this ongoing battle to stay afloat in our own minds filled with endless thoughts, **not every single day is a bad one.** 

In fact, we go through periods of time where everything feels alright again for a while. So when those good days finally come around, we appreciate it and never take it for granted. 

Because to those who struggle with mental illness, it is a privilege to feel the true happiness that **everyone** deserves to feel every day.

Sincerely,

The mentally ill",mentalhealth
1579300993.0,We are asking Congress to take action on the mental health crisis in America.,"Hey guys,

We are a group of high school students who are committed to solving the mental health issues of today through awareness and policy. The mental health crisis is one of the most prevalent issues facing the American population today, not only the youth. 

We are also compiling a list of candidate endorsements who are pledging to focus on mental health reform once they are inaugurated.

In fact, 1 in 5 American adults experience some form of mental illness each year (National Alliance on Mental Illness), while only 41% receive proper treatment (Mental Health First Aid). This is unacceptable, and we demand action now.

We’ve witnessed these problems in our own schools and neighborhoods, and we believe it is time for us as a country to step up and pass bold solutions to protect everyday people. 

We are also asking you to sign and share our petition (https://www.change.org/p/u-s-congress-pass-comprehensive-mental-health-legislation-now ) to ask Congress and the President to commit to comprehensive mental health reform to ensure that everyone has access to quality mental health care.

Thank you.

Edit: Thanks for the overwhelming support, we would never have dreamt of getting almost 350 upvotes in only one day. We have just started a GoFundMe in order to raise money to increase the awareness of this crisis on more platforms such as 
Instagram, Twitter, and Google. The link can be found at (https://www.gofundme.com/f/ask-congress-to-priortize-mental-health?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link-tip&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet). Have a great day!",mentalhealth
1564554589.0,My 9-year-old is madly obsessed with me. Any advice?,"&#x200B;

At first it seemed very cute and sweet, like a “Crush” sort of thing. Through this past few years it has been escalating to a point where it is creepy and I fear for her mental health and future safety. I’m telling this story as a way of trying to get some opinions. 

Let’s call her Cindy, she is a daughter of a cousin of mine who I am not that close to, but we still get along pretty well. I’m going to share some anecdotes so you all can see what I mean. 

We come from a family where reunions and parties are common and happen at least once a month. So, we all see each other frequently. Cindy always wants to be around me, she wants me to play with her and hold her every minute of every single reunion. Whenever I dare to hug, say hi, or even acknowledge any other member of the family (especially when it comes to younger females of the family) she would get upset and throw a tantrum, running away onto the streets. Whenever the family starts dancing outside (which is pretty often lol) Cindy makes me pick her up and dance with her. I can only dance with her, no other female is allowed near me, I can’t even put her down to go the bathroom or have a drink. And whenever I did put her down well… temper tantrum time. 

She once smacked her youngest sister (Mia, 2-year-old) so hard it almost knocked her out, just because she was walking around the house, spotted me, smiled, and wanted to get close to say hi. 

Anytime another female of the family would bring me something to eat or drink, she would make me give it back or throw it away so she could go and bring me whatever I had just been given. 

One time I did not show up to one of those reunions because some other plan that sounded more fun came around (dick move I know). Cindy asked everyone a thousand times where I was, and why I wasn’t showing up. Eventually they got tired of her and decided to call me, I explained that I was hanging out with some friends. When they told her about this, she got furious, grabbed a stone and threw it at the nearest car, breaking one of the windows. She then locked herself up inside one of the rooms. 

3 or 4 times a week, Cindy’s mom would call me, telling me Cindy wanted me to come over so I could help her with her homework. Sometimes, her other sister (8-year-old) would ask for my help too, causing Cindy to flip out, throw things at her, and call her names. Whenever I refused the invitation to help Cindy with her hw, she would start ripping her notebooks and textbooks, or pouring water on them. 

She then started to force her parents to bring her to my place every other day, even if it was for a short visit. This One time they left her with me because they needed someone to watch her to do some errands. Cindy was in my room, and I left for a couple of minutes to get her some snacks. When I came back, I found her going thru my clothes. She started crying and said she wanted to steal one of my t-shirts so she could remember me with it. I thought it was kind weird, but cute in a way. I told her she could have one of her choosing. Each time she came over after that she demanded a new shirt to take. I told her I couldn’t give her anymore shirts because I don’t have many. (which is true) Every time she would come, we would have the exact same conversation, until, without me noticing, she took pretty much all my shirts and stuffed them inside her backpack. Her mother had to come back the next day and give them back. 

I used to play along and not say much to her or her mother because, like I said, I thought it just was a “crush” or just a little girl overly attached to an older family member. It escalated gradually to a point which I didn’t know what to do. And besides, I’m really not into confrontation, so I didn’t want to cause any trouble. 

Last time I saw Cindy was this past weekend. (another family reunion) but this time, I brought my new girlfriend with me (she was my best friend for 6 years but I escaped the friendzone haha). Cindy was using crutches because she had gotten injured doing something or other while at school, so she couldn’t follow me around like she usually does. 

Obviously, she got furious when she met my girlfriend, but she didn’t say much. She sat right between us and didn’t let us kiss, hug or dance. Laura (my gf) Went to grab a drink for both of us, and immediately Cindy started moving around so she was occupying the rest of the sofa. When Laura came back, she refused to move and let her sit. I lost my patience (even when I lose my patience, I’m still pretty chill) and told her that she was being mean to my GF and that meant she was also being mean to me. I also told her we (Me and Laura) would have to leave if she kept it up.

Cindy lost it, she started screaming and kicking, she called Laura every name in the book and finished by saying that if we continued being together, she would shoot us both with his father’s gun. Turns out my cousin is not very bright, and it took her this long to realize something might be wrong with her daughter. My cousin pulled me aside and I told her everything, everything I just told you and a lot more. I advised her to seek help for Cindy and told her it was best if I stayed away for a while. 

Im really worried about Cindy and her wellbeing. So please, if anyone has gone thru something similar, or if some of you understand what is going on and what can I do to help. I would gladly listen. 

Thank you. Ps. English is not my first language so sorry if some of the writing is gibberish.",mentalhealth

1619095873.0,Is it just me or does life just feel like shit,"Honestly, lately life has just felt well lifeless.  


People are angry at each other from all over the globe. Whether if it's because of politics, the pandemic, race, cops, etc. It just feels like everywhere people are just angry. If they aren't angry then they are most likely depressed given the state of the world and what's been going on. When you think of all those things together it really makes you feel like life has been shit and still is.   


The folks on the news always seem like they are either angry at something or have something negative to talk about. The people around me are uneasy with what's been going on. Jobs have been hard to come by when taking the pandemic into consideration. If you don't want to work with other people because you are scared of the virus that's a huge chunk of jobs you can't get. Even if you get a job it's been tough trying to get a place to live comfortably. The folks I know that have a place either work 90% of their week, have two jobs or are unable to treat themselves because they can't afford to.  


The most frustrating about all this is the lack of attention mental health has been getting. At least on a national level.  All you hear is cases and deaths with very few articles mentioning mental health. When you do they are actually talking about people who have Covid or have had Covid are experiencing depression. Like you can't have mental health issues without Covid? What kind of nonsense is that? Vaccines came out which you would think is something we should be hopeful for the news tries to scare people with ""hesitancy may stop us from going back to normal"".   


Anyways that's all I have to say. I do really hope it gets better, but lately the longer the pandemic drags on I feel it's just going to make people worse and worse. Both mentally and physically.",mentalhealth

I remembered once a group of ladies were sitting with some of the staff and chatting about stuff, and another patient was crying hard and obviously having a problem. The staff just pretended to not see what was happening and kept chatting with the old ladies.

Any kind of therapy was aimed at the lowest common denominator, and that's understand but also useless. It was maybe playing word games or reading the safety rules. Nothing helpful.

1692438068.0,I wish people understood or cared about the psychological damage of small penis shaming.,"Growing up a boy, society repeatedly makes sure you understand a few things about being a man. On for those things is that a man is supposed to be big. Both in height, but especially in penis size. You see that any man who's small is to be treated with ridicule and scorn. And you see that men with big penis are treated with admiration and praise.

It's been 7 years since mine was referred to as a ""*pencil dick*"" by a woman (not to my face, but to a friend who thought I should know). I don't wanna go into the personal depression spiral I went through, being convinced I was sexually unlovable, but I will say it's not 7 years since, and I'm still deathly afraid of getting naked with a woman. I just don't feel safe.

I know the world will never change. No matter what forms of body shaming become publicly wrong to do, small penis shaming will remain a good, popular and acceptable form if body shaming. So my struggle is maintaining some form of self -worth, when I'm constantly reminded how worthless and inadequate having a small penis makes a man, when I hear people laughing at small penis jokes, as if it really does make us deserving of ridicule.",mentalhealth

Let's do this one without too much thinking and rationalizing, OK?

It will be worth it, I promise.

Afterwards, drop a comment or hit reply to share how it felt.

**Before you do this mirror exercise read this**

* Find a mirror where you can be alone and undisturbed
* Then look at yourself. Really, look into your eyesNo preening, no posing
* Breathe slowlyUnclench your jaw
* Ease your shoulders down
* Unclench your toesOne more breath

Now say to yourself:

>I love you  
>  
>I am going to take care of you  
>  
>You're going to be OK

Yes, you can say it out loud.

No overthinking. Just do it.

How did you see yourself?

Did you feel any tenderness towards the face in the mirror?

Did it feel strange or emotional, or just indifferent?

I don't know about you, but I felt like crying. In a good way.

It felt emotional and tender. Like a step towards accepting and loving myself.

Yet, I cannot stop thinking about how there’s no point to it all. Does anybody else around my age (18-24) have the same impending sense that no matter what you put your effort into it’s not going to matter? The world is such a volatile shitty place and society keeps changing. Am I preparing for a life I’ll never have the chance to live? I often think about how I wouldn’t have time for depression or anxiety if we were still hunter gatherers. How can I be sad when I gotta get off my ass to hunt down dinner and find water?

I haven’t been exercising because of an injury I got awhile ago plus it’s just really hard to get up and going. My depression has been kicking my ass lately, and I’m starting to feel horrible because of my appearance, not to mention I get gender dysphoria.
I want to try exercising 15 minutes a day 3 times a week. A super small amount of time just sitting on the floor of my dorm stretching and doing planks/push-ups/whatever.
I always hate exercising. Especially cardio and running because it always makes me nauseous and want to puke and feels very painful. But I think focusing on something I’d enjoy more (strength) would help me be consistent. I feel a little burn in my arms and shoulders but honestly it’s a little good.

1592505777.0,Just another rape story,"Hello, trapped in quarantine here and nobody to talk to so I’ve chosen to write it out. I (24f) was raped by my own cousin for over a year when I was 14 years old. Story started with force, him moving my hand, forcing my head down, holding me down, locking me in cars, etc. Same things that are pretty common with those raped by family members. What I want to talk about is the aftermath. What nobody really realizes. My virginity wasn’t lost the same way as my friends growing up, I felt my body was meant to be used because that’s all he told me I was good for. So I believed him. After having that happen to you for that long you begin to go numb. It starts out with fighting then when you realize there isn’t anything you can do after fighting screaming and clawing you way out for months you just give in and want to get it over with. I don’t feel like my body is mine, I don’t have a connection with sex. I hear stories of people having sexual partners because they are in love or want to share that with their partners, but I have always viewed sex as my duty. It was my job to make men feel nice, I never had a right to say no. Still feel like I don’t. I don’t have connections with people, every friend I push away because I don’t “fit in” with them. I’m disconnected from what your typical 24 year old would want to do (drink, party, yoga, etc) my focus for the time I’ve grown up is to just make sure it doesn’t happen again. Survivor mentality if you will... I’m not saying all this to feel sorry for myself. It happens to a lot of people. But what happened to me made me feel like a outcast, I can’t share “losing my virginity” stories because it wasn’t funny or cute. I can’t stay in relationships with... well anyone because I don’t trust people because if family can hurt me in that way what’s to stop others. I don’t talk to friends (don’t have any), I’ve lost a lot of my family due to what happened and the family I haven’t lost like my mom, dad, and brother I don’t talk to them anymore because they don’t understand why I’ve changed so much from the happy go lucky “pretty teenage girl” to the cold hearted one I am today. Nobody can help you but yourself. I’ve been told over and over again to “just get over it” but here we are, 10 years later. And I’m over what happened to me, it doesn’t haunt me like it use to. But that doesn’t mean it didn’t permanently change me. My ability to form relationships, my mentality, my hobbies, my happiness, or my thought processes all have been changed because of one person 10 years ago. So for those that have been raped, you don’t have to just get over it, you don’t have to just bury it, but you can build because of it. I’m a strong person because of it, just isolated. So if you guys have any questions like how to help those that have been through it I will try to answer to the best of my abilities as another survivor. Thanks for reading.

Edit: woke up this morning and saw the post get so much love! Thank you guys for sharing this, I hope it helps those that have been told over and over that it gets better to see from someone that has been through it, it really does get better.",mentalhealth

I was never allowed to have cats growing up, although I am a huge cat lover. My parents thought they were stinky, no-good animals. At the beginning of 2021 I felt this huge void that needed to be filled by an animal. A furry companion that would give me a purpose in life to be its care-taker. To make me interested in living again. So I adopted my cat, Pepper.

My parents were absolutely livid. It was probably the worst week of my life, they were yelling at me. Telling me I just need to “be strong” and get over my depression. I felt like a bad person because I disobeyed their house rules. But it was getting to the point where I wanted to die really bad. My meds were upped, I started taking a new pill but the sadness still kept creeping in through the cracks. 

Sometimes I think about admitting myself to a hospital but I think about how I need to be here for him. I want the best life for my boy, he’s been spoiled with so much love, toys, treats, and a tall kitty condo. Everyday I look forward to waking up to feed him or give him pets. 

Pepper might not know it, but his existence is everything to me.

Not only does she brighten my mood just by being the best dog I’ve ever had, but she helps me through panic attacks, and keeps me from harming myself(I punch and hit myself in the legs and head). I never had to teach her anything, she picked it up all on her own. 

Also, Sandi is one of the only reasons I leave the house, other than work.

1553900835.0,"[Personal victory] For the first time ever, I was able to calm myself down after a panic attack, instead of going crazy in my own head","My SO went out of town last night to go out with the guys. I generally try not to bother him when he’s out doing that because that’s his time to do what he wants. He has not come yet, which is fine by me. However, the one message I sent him asking “is there plans we made for this weekend that I forgot about?”, he has yet to respond to. It’s been six hours since he was last active according to Facebook messenger. 

My panic attack started when I had this insane thought “was he out all night boozing around getting frisky/messing with other women?”. My heart started racing, my mind was running wild, I started to breathe heavier and heavier. I was in this state for about 30 minutes trying to remain calm. 

Finally, I took a deep breath and thought to myself: “If he didn’t cheat on me, I’m worked up for no reason. If he DID cheat, I will deal with him later.” There was nothing I could do at that point in time, because he either did or didn’t do anything. But getting worked up about it now literally does nothing but make me miserable. 

I view this (the calming myself down part) as a personal victory. I’ve never been good at handling panic attacks well when I’m by myself. So I am kind of proud of myself.

1627255281.0,I Worry About This Sub,"Day after day, night after night I scroll through my feed to catch up quick and I see so many posts on this sub, mostly genuine people looking for encouragement, empathy, or just to know they're not alone. But looking for that something, that one thing that's gonna turn their struggle around. 

Sometimes a particular post will catch my eye and I'll interact, but for the most part I watch time after time as people, mostly young people, reach out for somebody's hand and no one is there to respond. I don't view this as any one person or group of people's fault, I just think the sheer numbers of those looking for real help overwhelm the number of people qualified and/or willing enough to provide it by such a large margin that a lot of the sub continually consists of largely ignored cries for help. 

I wonder what impact this has on the greater good that all of us try to do for ourselves or other people when it comes to providing mental health care, referrals, and advice. I wonder if there's a way it could be done better by all of us involved not only with our mental health for one reason or another, but with our specific involvement in the sub.

1587605821.0,My depression took my personality,"During my (f 20) teenage years I dealt with depression. At some point during that, it became all I was. As many people know depression can make you loose interest in things that previously interested you.
I lost all my hobbies and a big chuck of my personality. I was a shell.

I've since overcome that part of my life and am left with this same shell. I dont particularly have anything that makes me me anymore. I don't have the patience/strength to really finish anything I start (eg artwork or writing) and when I don't finish it it brings me down more.

Essentialy I don't have a personality. I think I'm very boring and have crippling social skills. I don't know how I would go about trying to fix this.

My lack of social skills (due to isolating myself through arguably the most important part of my life, development wise) has also resulted in me loosing all my friends and unable to reconcile or make new ones.

I figure I can't be the only one going through this or something similar and wonder why this big part of this mental illness isn't really talked about

1604842888.0,I let my social anxiety stop me from seeing my Dad for the last time,"My Dad had been fighting cancer for a couple of years and had been going downhill recently. He was admitted to hospital several weeks ago and, due to COVID restrictions, only one person could visit him a day. 

I have severe  anxiety about going into new places, that is manageable when I’m with my boyfriend, but when I’m by myself.... I just cannot cope. The thought of going to the hospital and having to navigate it myself was far too much. 

My dad got moved to a hospice last Thursday for palliative care. 2 people could now visit at a time! But we were so busy with work.... I had planned on going to visit on the Monday but we received a phone call Sunday evening saying he was now unconscious and likely wouldn’t wake up. Immediately, we rushed u but he more than likely had no idea we were there.... he passed away on Wednesday. 

If I had gone to the hospital I would’ve been able to tel him one last time that I loved him. Due to COVID I haven’t hugged this man since February, as even when the restrictions were slackened I didn’t want to risk passing anything onto a shielding person. If I had went to the hospital I could have wrapped my arms around him one last time. 

But my social anxiety held me back. And now I don’t know if I can live with myself.

I used the chat line because I get too anxious when i have to talk on the phone and the guy was really helpful and he asked me if i had a plan and I lied and told him no because I was afraid of what would happen if I did tell him that I have a plan to kill myself so I told him that I was just having thoughts of suicide and that I didn't have a plan to kill myself. Then we just talked about what was going on and what's making me feeling this way and then we came up with a plan on what I could do tonight to keep myself distracted and busy and he gave me some coping mechanism that I could use. I talked to him for about 40 minutes and he told my that I could always contact the hotline again if the thoughts comes back. Honestly the suicide hotline did help me this time and I felt a little better after talking with them. So if you're having suicidal thoughts don't be afraid to contact your local suicide hotline it might help and if you have contacted the hotline before and have had a bad experience like I did the first time don't be afraid to try again because it kind of stopped me from doing something really bad tonight.,mentalhealth

You may not be able to tell, but under my clothes are strategically placed scars, the blade scores my skin in places you will never see. You percieve the way I dress as modesty.

I don't shower or change for a week on end. And when I leave the house, my significant other often has to tell me I am wearing something inside out or backwards. Sometimes it takes me a couple of tries, and you see only the end result.

I don't seem like I have schizophrenia, but when in mixed company, I will take excessive trips to the bathroom, just for a moment of silence, because things are a bit too loud. You see someone with an over-active bladder. 

I don't seem like I have schizophrenia, because the whole world would fear me if I did. And when I DO act out of character, because my mask has become too heavy, you are shocked. You perceive this as selfishness, toxicity, or childlike.

1567065613.0,Instagram removed my picture of my manicure because I had visible scars,"I cant contact instagram and I have no where else to share this but I'm livid. I took a picture of my manicure (i've never gotten one before) and in the bottom bit of the picture you could see some scars from self harm I did in the past. But my picture gets fucking REMOVED because it is ""encouraging self harm""

So apparently instagram shames and censors people with scars? Am I not allowed to show my arm in public light? Do I have to fucking hide my arm when I take pictures? It's absolutely disgusting 

I've had this same thing happen in discord servers, where I have my arm in the picture and it's not the focus of the picture AT all and my shit gets deleted. I'm not ashamed of my scars, it's a part of my story and I don't want to hide it nor should I have to hide it. It's ok to have scars and I want others to know that too

I (18NB) Was at a local Starbucks a couple hours ago and a homeless man got beaten up outside of it. Me and my dad went outside and there was blood all over the ground, a huge gash in his head, and it looked like he was beaten to a bloody pulp. I have never in my life witnessed so much blood coming out of a person. I was the only one who had the courage to go to him with some wet towels and help out with whatever he needed. He was taken away by an ambulance a few moments later. I do not know the motive but the man who beat him up and the man himself did know each other, so i don’t think it was homeless induced violence.

The doctor literally passed her responsibility off onto the police. How does that help me? I tried to get into a depression clinic and their first question is about suicide. I say I don’t want to answer and they tell me that obviously I am suicidal then. So, that’s their trigger to call police.

There is no help. I don’t have plans to kill myself, but after all this and seeing that there literally isn’t any help, I am making some. Thanks health care community!!

The path of life is not paved solely in joyous moments, there are twisted unknown parts that lead us through the darkest of forests, hills that seem insurmountable, rivers that we cannot ford, and past demons that others cannot see.⁣⁣


We cannot make this journey alone and we should not try.

No one must ever think that they need to face these challenges alone.  Call on others and find the strength you need in them.⁣

1541457166.0,I was finally accurately diagnosed after 12 years thanks to the show 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend'," 

Throwaway account for reasons that may be obvious and a **Spoiler** for season 3 of the show.

Let me start off by giving you guys some backstory. I have been in therapy for a wide array of issues: Compulsive spending, depression, anxiety, manic episodes, suicidal attempts. I attempted many times to get a diagnosis but I wouldn't share any embarrassing details that I will share with you. Every psychiatrist I would see would base these disorders off as the result of childhood trauma and an absent father. I was on all the medications you’ve probably heard of Buspar, Prozac, Xanax, and Zoloft. 

My relationships have never really been stable in both interpersonal and romantic areas. I’ve had 3 romantic relationships my entire life with the longest relationship lasting 6 months. Whenever I developed feelings for someone it would turn into severe infatuation where it went as far as stalking, rearranging my work schedule to be able to interact with him, and try to change my physical appearance in order to get them to fall for me. I am not proud of any of this but I need to stop denying that this was happening. With friendships, whenever a friend would cancel plans like drinks at the bar I would fall into a severe depression where suicidal thoughts would come to mind. I would call these friends and tell them I was considering suicide in order to get them to come see me. 

My manic episodes started getting pretty severe over the past few months to the point where I would take a week off from work and take lavish spontaneous trips to Europe, I started having auditory hallucinations of a ‘sane me’ insulting me and calling me crazy. I would go to Vegas on weekends to go on an alcohol binger and have numerous random sexual encounters. I would also lock myself in my room after work and watch TV for 6 hours straight. I will admit, I was too ashamed to open up about this as I was scared of being institutionalized and being known in my family as the freak.

In August, I wanted to start watching a new show and came across the show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. I had heard of the show before but because of the name I thought it was related to the meme I had grown annoyed of so I never really gave it a chance. As I started watching I was horrified that there were a few similarities between myself and the character Rebecca Bunch, the stalking, lavish spending, fear of abandonment, the hallucinations. The fact that she was the titular “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” left me in a slight depression and I almost stopped watching. However when I reached season 3 where Rebecca finally gets diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I decided to finally go to a new psychiatrist to get another opinion and decided not to hold back any information that I was scared would be regarded as ‘crazy’ people behavior. Thanks to the show’s portrayal of mental illness, I was finally able to open up about the stalking, the auditory hallucinations, and everything in between. After 12 years of therapy my official diagnosis is Self-Destructive Borderline and while the road to recovery will be a long one, I am hopeful that someday I will be able to completely manage my BPD. If you're currently going through something similar know that you aren't alone and the medical professionals are there to help you not judge you.

TLDR; Was an undiagnosed Borderline for 12 years but thanks to the show’s portrayal of mental illness I finally opened up about topics I was ashamed to admit, finally getting an accurate diagnosis.",mentalhealth

1616302194.0,I lost it over my son's hair,"Yesterday, I noticed that my son had been chewing on a lock of his hair. No big deal lots of kids do that. I explained why he can't and that we need to trim some of his hair to deal with the damage he did to it. It was pretty torn up in one spot. His is super proud of his long hair. It was down to the middle of his back when it is wet and to his shoulders dry because of his curls. 

My mom when to beauty school years ago and offered to cut it for me. I was very hesitant because my family jokes about cutting his hair behind my back. I told her to only cut it to his shoulders but she gave him basically her hair cut which it the short old lady cut that she and my grandma have. It looks awful and I asked her to stop but she kept insisting that she needed to even it out. 

By the time she was done I was in tears. I ran out to the car to calm down so the kids didn't see me cry. My mom came out and made jokes about how I'm not speaking to her and laughed and asked if she could cut my hair next. 

I took the kids home and fed them and attempted to put his hair in his braids that I always do but it is too short. I had a full meltdown after the kids when to bed and basically hyperventilated on my kitchen floor. I'm so angry that my chest hurts and I asked my son after I was calm what he wanted to do with it and he said ""please, don't take any more of my hair."" I know I'm more upset then he is.

1634819226.0,Did my mom sexually assault me? Its not sexually motivated by it definitely felt violating.,"My mom has always been sadistic towards me. She would drag me by the hair and cut it like a maniac as some punishment then tell me how ugly i look, or she would watch me throwing up on the floor and not help cos I’m being punished. However, there are instances when i do something that “would dishonour” the family? She would try to strip me down infront of my own brothers, violently pulling at my clothes while i try to cover myself. One time she told me to get naked and bend over the bed so she could check if my “hymen was intact”. 
I feel nothing but anger tbh, i normalised that behaviour from her so much that it didn’t bother me after some time, it doesn’t bother me when someone molests me in public either. I think I achieved that level of apathy and indifference by dissociation myself from my body. I consider my body as a vessel i am in, and when someone hurts or violates it, they are violating the vessel and not me personally. I do feel anger though at her and everything she put me through, so ig i feel smth. Can i call these experiences sexual abuse?



Edit: Thanks for everyone’s kind words and thanks to everyone who opened up about similar experiences. I wanted to assure everyone that i am 23 now, last time i was sexually abused by her was a couple months prior to leaving the country at 18. I don’t have to see my family for another year. I wanted to discuss this in therapy but I just couldn’t find the words to describe it ig, I didn’t know what to label it as. Now I know what to call it, i can communicate it better in therapy.

about 8 years ago I had a threesome with a married couple who I'd known since we were kids. The deal was he wouldn't be with me but we'd both be with her, which I agreed to. It was a fun night, and afterwards I fell asleep. I woke up some time later with someone spooning me, groping me, and kissing the back of my neck. I tried to push them off, I had no idea who it was or what was happening. When I realized it was the husband I said ""no, please stop"" several times, but he wouldn't listen and kept fighting me. eventually I just gave in. He sodomized me and after he finished made me promise to never tell his wife, Liz. (she had left us alone to go pick someone up at the airport). tbh I never had a lot of self esteem and to say I felt humiliated is an understatement. I didn't want it to happen but I let it happen anyway, i could've protested more maybe if i did it wouldn't of happened. I went home. I was bleeding a lot, one of my roommate noticed and asked me what happened, after a while of her whining I told her and she said ""well that's what you get for whoring around"". 

I accepted what she said, and after that I never told anyone about it, not even my therapists. it's something I try to not dwell over, but when i think about it i feel gross, and sad.

*Edit: I just want to say thank you all for the supportive comments. It means a lot, truly.*

1619188583.0,"I started turning off and locking my phone away every weekend, and it's liberating","This may not apply to everyone. But for me, a person who is severely addicted to instagram and messaging apps, it's just really liberating. I bought this locking device that allows you to lock something in it and set a time for it to reopen (not naming any brand here, everyone please don't make this a post about products). I started out by locking my phone for a few hours, then a whole day, and eventually a whole weekend.

It is surprisingly beneficial to my mental health. I am a hypersensitive type and love to overread and overthink anything anyone say to me. And I also don't have a life. So what happen is that I need to constantly chat with my friends and family, even to the point that may annoy them, and when they show a lil bit of disinterest, even when they are really just busy, I'd literally feel hurt, it sounds so stupid to say such thing as a grown ass person, but yes, and I really hate myself for that.

Once I locked my phone, my brain will immediately try to find substitutes to generate the same stimulation, sometimes I'd use my computer to browse the internet but using the computer just never brings me the same negativity that a phone does, same as how youtube and reddit are somehow just much less toxic than ig and whatsapp to me. I don't play video games and my social circles don't use facebook anymore, so I normally can shut my computer pretty quick because I feel bored again.

And weird enough the next thing I know is that I find myself actually get up from my lazy ass and start doing things like chores, sorting mails and even doing some exercise. I don't think I am anywhere near being mentally healthy, but seriously I am much much better off without that damn phone.

Edit: Sorry guys I can't pm the brand of the device, it's against the rule, you can generally search timed locking box and anything similar will do. There are many boxes that do it.

Edit: The point of this post is really just to put your phone away, and you will instantly feel better once you can detach from the toxicity and focus on yourself.",mentalhealth

1654064006.0,"Are you afraid you'll kill someone/an animal, f*ck your sister, or abuse a child? Consider OCD","I've spent a lot of time scrolling various mental health subs on reddit or other subs that encourage venting or advice-seeking. Sometimes, I come across posts by people who are describing the unthinkable:

They might be afraid they're attracted to a family member, afraid they may be a pedophile, afraid they'll choke their cat, afraid they'll commit homicide. 

In almost all of these posts, I can clearly tell what they are describing is undiagnosed OCD. Other people don't seem to see that, though. Commentors respond with vitriol, disgust, hatred, ""You need to get some serious help."" Which puts someone with OCD into a place where their ocd gets life threateningly worse-- because people just told them they are what they fear they are. EVEN THOUGH they are most likely the opposite.

Not to say that every time I see someone post about these violent or unspeakable thoughts I assume it's definitely ocd. Rather, I notice the following:

*They are afraid they will act on these thoughts

*They are trying to get reassurance that they won't act on these thoughts 

*They don't like these thoughts. These thoughts are distressing

*The way they describe their thoughts clearly describes intrusive thoughts just without the vocabulary

*They describe compulsions without knowing they are compulsions

*Their post *is* a compulsion (reassurance-seeking, checking, researching, confessing)

The list goes on.

I have OCD. I actually have hospitalized myself because I believed I was going to kill my parents, sister, or classmates. I believed I was going to kill my cat at the time. I've been afraid I was going to become a pedophile. I've been afraid I was going to become a cannibal. I've been afraid I was going to kill my partner and keep their body. I've been afraid my affinity for foods with red sauce meant I was thirsting for human blood and flesh.

Regardless of the theme of the intrusive thoughts, many intrusive thoughts are or feel unspeakable. Because people associate OCD with symmetry and hand washing, most people miss the fact that OCD can involve incredibly tabboo and violent intrusive thoughts. Furthermore; OCD feels real. It feels real. Meaning, you FEEL like you actually do want to kill people. You feel like you actually are attracted to your sister even though you arent. A lot of people with OCD don't think they have it because it feels so real that if they accept its ocd, they might lose their hypervigilance and act on the thoughts. Because if they stop their compulsions, they believe that they will act on the thoughts. 

The stigma around mental health isn't just about personal hygeine or being late to work. Sometimes, people are afraid they're gonna fuck their dog and when they talk about it, everyone freaks the fuck out and doesn't look for signs of OCD. 

Most people with OCD don't realize they have it. So, when they're overwhelmed with these incredibly horrifying thoughts, they might seek online support. They might make posts like ""I'm afraid I'm going to lose control of my homicidal urges."" ""Am I attracted to my sister?"" ""I'm worried I'm a pedophile""

But as someone with ocd, I read these posts and very clearly see the other ocd symptoms attached to these fears. What do other people see? They see rapists, murderers, pedophiles, paraphiliacs. Even though these posts tend to involve details like ""I've never hurt anyone."" ""I'm too scared to hurt anyone."" ""I've never touched anyone.""

Still, the comments treat them like filth. Like criminals. And that's part of the problem.

When I tried to reach out about my Harm ocd when I was 14, my counselor freaked out when I told her about my thoights and started screening me for ASPD. I know someone who was falsely diagnosed with ASPD when they actually had harm ocd and it fucked them up for years. People with OCD do not want to act on these thoughts. These thoughts go against their identity and core values. These thoughts scare them even if they feel so real, even if they feel like they are choosing to think them.

People with Harm ocd or sexual assault themed ocd are some of the least likely people to commit these acts. They are constantly engaging in compulsions to prevent it, and they DONT want these things to happen. (Ie I used to tie my ankle to my bed post at night so I wouldn't kill anyone. I used to not go to school so I wouldn't lunge out at anyone. I used to not pet my cat because I didn't want to kill him. I used to avoid hugging my sister because I thought it meant I was attracted to her... even though I'm gay and also ew???. I never baby sat my cousins because I was afraid I wanted to hurt them or abuse them.)

I encourage people to consider ocd. When you see these ""scary"" or ""disgusting"" posts, look out for characteristics of ocd. Anecdotal evidence but I guarantee, 9/10 times what these people are describing is undiagnosed ocd, obsessional thinking, and intrusive thoughts. They just don't have the vocabulary. Instead of saying ""I have intrusive thoughts about hurting someone I love."" They say ""I keep having homicidal urges. How can I stop them?""

Sometimes, people need compassion even if what they're saying is shocking and you couldn't imagine having the same fears or thoughts. Instead of mocking them or treating them like monsters, look for OCD. Often times when people with undiagnosed ocd reach out for help, they're not going to have the vocabulary to confirm to viewers/readers that what they're experiencing is intrusive thoughts and obsessional fear. They're going to describe something scary because it's something that scares them and its what they're experiencing. 

Ending mental health stigma doesn't stop at forgiving people for not showering. It's also looking deeper when someone says ""what if I choke my cat."" ""What if I molest someone.""

Because believe it or not, people can think things and not want them to happen. In fact sometimes people's thoughts can be their greatest fears. OCD is egodystonic, meaning it specifically latches on to your values and exposes you to the opposite. 

Before you call someone a psychopath, consider ocd.

1570490826.0,I no longer want to die.,"This time 2 months ago, I was 34 weeks pregnant, with an adoption plan in place to relinquish my baby at birth. After years of suffering heavily with my mental health, I thought I was too fucked up to be able to love a child. No maternal instincts, I couldn’t even look after myself, how the fuck would I look after a baby?

I thought it’d be cruel to subject a child to a lifetime with me. That my baby would be better with someone else, I concealed the pregnancy from my entire family, I’d completely isolated myself from everybody, convinced that I would give birth, give up my baby, and never tell a soul. 

The isolation, spending weeks on end alone in a flat without leaving the house led to a massive decline in my already dire mental health. At 8 months pregnant, an ambulance was called to me at a multi story car park at 3am. I couldn’t do it, not when there was only a few weeks to go, as much as I wanted to die, I figured I’d hang on just 4 more weeks until my baby was born, then I’d do it. 

This led to many services getting involved, social workers, specialist midwives, the crisis team, the home treatment team and even perinatal mental health specialists. I’m not going to go into detail about the home environment I was in, because it still pains me to this day, but it was heavily infested with rats, only one window to the whole place, but because I was heavily pregnant (suffering with carpal tunnel) and could no longer work (I’m self employed, no maternity leave/pay.) I was stuck there, In this dungeon, 8 months pregnant stuck in a dark hell hole I couldn’t go outside due to concealing my pregnancy, listening to rats chewing through the walls around me. I was so ready to die.

Then, my family tried to barge in, convinced that I had fallen into a horrible drug addiction or worse, was rotting away alone, I promised that I would see them the next day and tell them what was happening. They thought this was me being ready to open up, get help, when really it was me giving up. I had nothing left to lose, I planned on being dead soon anyway, and I missed them. During my pregnancy, because of me concealing it i had to miss seeing my mother in hospital after she was rushed in for emergency surgery, my family dog dying (I never got to say goodbye) and, the death of my aunty and her funeral. I figured if I was going to die soon, I wanted to spend my last bit of time with them. I was surrendering, the adoption plan was in place, my baby would have a good life.

My family were supportive, as I knew they would be. Many services presumed my reason for hiding the pregnancy from them was out of fear, but it was the opposite. I’m lucky to come from a loving wealthy family who I didn’t want to change my mind. I wanted to die. 

My family begged me not to go through with the adoption, my mother offering to take full custody of my baby if I tried motherhood and didn’t like it. I wanted them to be happy, I thought he could be my replacement when I was gone, that he’d keep them busy and take some weight off their grief of losing me. I agreed, my mother got me to move back in with her, and I enjoyed the luxuries of sleeping at night not worrying about rats crawling over me and having access to hot water again. 

12 days after I told my family I was pregnant, my beautiful baby boy was born, 3 weeks early. From the second I first held him, he was my boy, and he wasn’t going anywhere.

From the moment he was here, it’s like my mental illness has been an awful boot camp that I’ve finally graduated. Like all my suffering is now worth something. 

As you’ll know, BPD amplified all emotions, I feel everything so intensely my emotions are like a physical sensation. In the past, this has caused me so much pain and heartbreak, until the second I first held my son, and the feeling of maternal love flooded me with the most intense, incredible feeling i could ever imagine. Something I never imagined I could feel, that I thought I was too fucked up to experience, came to me so naturally. And now I have a little human who I can love as much as I want and it doesn’t aggravate him. I’m never ‘too much’ for him, because he needs me and depends on me fully. How can I possibly be suicidal anymore when I have my baby who will always need me?

All those nights I’ve spent awake all hours in tears, seem like preparation for the sleepless nights of having a newborn (,minus the tears!) 

My baby has become my fixation, and the best part? He wants all of my love, he doesn’t want space from me. And I’m never alone anymore. I have somebody to be strong for. Do I still feel like shit sometimes? Absolutely. But I don’t get the chance to feel like shit for too long, cause my baby keeps me busy! My overthinking myself into depressive episodes? Don’t have the time anymore, my boy needs me.

I never imagined being a mother, and I never imagined getting better.. which I’m still not fully. But I’m the best I’ve been in years, and for the first time in a truly long time, I’m no longer suicidal. I want to be here, I want to care for my son, make sure he’s so loved that he’ll never feel unwanted like I have. And with him around, I can’t imagine feeling unwanted for a long time (until he’s old enough for me to be embarrassing!)

It’s like all the love that I’ve had to give finally has a place to go. I’m so happy. I look at him and I just want to do right by him, to be the best mother I can be. 

2 months ago I was 8 months pregnant, isolated from everybody, in a dark rat infested flat, planning on ending my life.

Now, I’m currently led on my big comfy double bed, watching my 6 week old baby sleeping peacefully beside me in his Moses basket, in a nice light clean house, smiling to myself and making plans for our future. 

I always rolled my eyes when people told me it gets better. I’d suffered over a decade of things just getting worse, until this year, I’d finally hit rock bottom. 

Now I’m on top of the world. I’ve never been happier than I have being a mother. It’s been so long since I’ve truly enjoyed being alive. 

This turned into a huge essay, but I don’t like sharing this too much IRL because of the shame and embarrassment of living in such poor conditions, the state my mental health had got to, and also now that he’s here... it breaks my heart to think I ever even considered adoption.

I’ve been heavily and closely monitored by many services, and in the 6 weeks since his birth, I’ve been discharged by 4, and have reduced visits from daily to fortnightly/monthly by all of them. They all tell me how amazing I’m doing at being a mother, and how in their professions it’s so nice to see a happy ending. I feel like I’m finally good enough at something, and that’s being his mummy.

Sorry to go on, I just wanted to share my story and hopefully inspire others that sometimes things do get better. Maybe your turnaround will be nothing like mine, and I’m not at all suggesting having a baby will cure your mental illness, but for me, this is finally me coming out of the other side. 

I’m finally happy. At 22 years old and a decade of diagnosed mental health problems, I don’t want to die anymore.",mentalhealth
1559273517.0,Why is mental health care so inaccessible?,"Everyone's advice is always, ""talk to a professional"" but nobody will acknowledge how impossible that is. 

I work a full-time job, with benefits. Financially, I'm not rich, but I'm not poor. My insurance supposedly covers mental health services, but I recently made the call for a referral, and I was only given a list of 3 providers. None of them are accepting new patients, and even if they were, I can't find enough info on them online to even know if they will be a good fit for me.

There are a few providers in town that I think I would feel really comfortable with, but they are not covered under my insurance and I cannot afford to pay out of pocket. I make enough that I don't qualify for sliding scale, but not enough to actually pay the full rates.

This is ridiculous to me that, at this point in my life, I am more financially stable than I ever have been and quite frankly, pretty privileged in terms of money. Yet, I cannot get decent mental health care.

Honestly, it scares me and it makes me feel a bit hopeless. I've been going back and forth with even wanting help, and it took a lot for me to finally decide to make that phone call. I'm super disappointed that I am not finding anything that can help me.",mentalhealth
1693005482.0,I hate being a woman.,"I feel so worthless and inferior.

I have green eyes and some freckles and I could try to do everything to look different but my face is just too plain. I feel like I'm pretty funny but whenever I tell a joke, no man laughs but when a man tells the same joke, everyone reacts.

Two of my interests are music and sports but often men tell me that I have stupid, bad or wrong options about them or that I don’t understand those thing at all. I feel like the biggest reason why I've been feeling this sad and inferior for the past couple of years is because I'm a female. I would do anything to be born as a man. I feel like such a pick me after writing all that but I’ve heard that other women feel the same as I do. Ofc not everyone but some.

Yesterday, I (Asian Male, 19) went to get a breakfast at a small restaurant near me. I sat at a long “bar” alone as I didn’t want to take up a table. Older man (White Male, probably about 60) walks in as I’m already served my food and makes the decision to sit by me with all of the empty spots around.

He seems like a nice enough fellow, but complains about his kids, ex wives, the price of food, politics, and just about everything. 

I make the traditional small talk, just trying to respond as positively as I could to his incessant negativity when out of nowhere I get “You ch-nks never know when to shut the fuck up and it’s starting to piss me off”. I was absolutely taken aback, and knowing that I have a large temper and I’m in a packed restaurant I quickly threw some cash on the table and when the ladies behind the counter asked me where I was going (leaving most of my food” I just said “I’m sorry, I lost my appetite” and walked out as fast as I could.

I didn’t want an assault charge or to cause a scene, but now I can’t sleep at all for the second night and all I hear is his voice. Now I don’t know if I did the right thing. I am not suicidal, but I am having the hardest time with fast thoughts, episodes of uncontrollable rage, and episodes of uncontrollable sadness as I hate that I couldn’t defend myself and I let him prove that I’m a coward. 

I have always been very socially concious and respectful, and I was taught that that was enough. I work hard, 4.0 double major, work charities, try hard.

I saw the recent documentary on incels by the BBC, and it was just me staring at what I've become.

I'm socially maladjusted due to my upbringing, my parents didn't allow me to interact with other kids, so my social skills dwindled ever since. I have a lot of social anxiety, and can barely look people in the eyes. My posture is stiff, I can't smile, I'm paranoid that everyone hates me.

I've been messing up again. Not knowing what's going on with schools and if they will close them again or if they will just keep going until kids start dropping. I don't know if I'm really worried if I've been made to feel that way. I don't know because the people in power are less honest than my 6 year old.

He's six. He was just 1. My other is 4. But he was just born it feels like. I'm 41. AND MY KIDS ARE 6 AND 4. How much longer do I have where I will be mentally fit to care for them? Or will I just be the old ass cranky dad who forgot what it's like to feel the magic of being a child? I haven't yet but one day I will. Will I make a big enough impact in my sons lives then when I die they will miss me? Will they talk about me with pride? Or will it be all the ways I failed...I'm so scared to screw up being a father that it is crippling.

My father wasn't a father. He was there. He didn't beat me or hurt me or scream at me. For that he would have had to actually care I was alive. I haven't spoke to him in years and I don't see that ever changing. My mom. My mother. The most racist, horrible, mean, scorned and damaged person I have ever met. I love her but I don't ever want to see them again.

I'm white. My wife is black. We have two mixed boys. The world is so messed up. Will my boys be treated different? Will they be looked down on? Will they not get chances because of it? Or will someone hand them something just because they are mixed? Why in the hell do I worry about this? Will they get killed at school? Will I be able to save them if they are in danger?

How do I cook a fucking hamburger on the stove without it turning to shit? I can't even fix the damn toilet that keeps clogging because I was never shown how to be a man and I know the world is different and It might not be right but It feels that way. I have nothing to be proud of. What my kids and wife? How in the hell has she not left me yet? I'm the most annoying person you could meet. I started puking again. I can't handle this. I used to be skinny and fast and strong. Now my knees hurt. The other day I hurt my neck from STANDING UP? It hurt for three days. I feel like there is nothing useful in me anymore. I'm 41 and anything that mattered is gone. Now I only have jobs. I have a job to raise my children to be great humans who don't hate. I have to teach my wife how to prepare for when I die. I have to make sure everyone is okay and taken care of. So when I die they are okay.

So what about while I'm alive? I get that I don't matter in the long run. My children do. But I am sick of being here. On Earth. I'm scared. I'm mentally alone. I make myself feel this way and I don't know why. I just want a life I can't have. I try to make things like they were...like all the horrid holidays when I was a child I try to make so beyond special for my kids that I've spoiled them and now nothing means anything.

I just want to feel like I'm wanted again. Not needed. I wish I had a friend. But I'm terrified of people. I can't even order at a drive thru without going into a minor panic attack and ordering too much. I'm starting to mentally crack at the smallest things. I don't yell or scream. I go sit in the garage and cry. So no one knows it. So when someone askes me why I'm sad and I explain it, they can't follow up with ""well what you need to do is"" ""or you shouldn't feel"". No shit. I'm not doing it for attention and I didn't say it was rational but I'm a grown ass man and I should not feel like this. I should not feel like I only matter because of ""responsibilities"". I just want someone to have a better day just because I am in their life. Why is it so wrong to want to feel good about something? To be noticed. For something besides ""can I have a snack"". Or because 99% of every decision that has to be made has to be made by me or it doesn't get made. I'm stretched too thin. I'm not superman. I can't do it all. I can't always make a decision. I'm human. And right now, I'm scared. And I'm not dealing with it okay. I knew that when I started to puke after I eat. There is this spot in the back and side of my mouth that if I tap with a straw I can empty my stomach in 10 seconds. So now I eat once a day. And I notice that my belly stays now. My whole life I could never gain a pound. 140 was the most I ever got. Then I was 160. And my stomach was gone. Now it was bigger. I was short of breath. My hair is gray in spots. I'm getting older. I'm already old. And one day I'll die. And idk what that is either. But I know that it doesn't matter what good I do, what will matter the most is what I wasn't able to do. The areas where I failed. Because no one is perfect. So I am going to fail. And that is the one thing I cannot afford to do.

I'm not asking for a pity party. I'm not asking for a damn thing. I just needed this out. But I will say that being a man makes this harder. Men are treated different when they talk about mental health. If I could just man up I would. And I do. Every damn day I man up. I do my job. I take care of my family and I'm damn good at it. But sometimes, it all comes in at me. Sometimes I get a chance to sit and think. And that is scary. I live my life on autopilot. When I stop to think is when it's bad.

I don't know any of you but I hope you are all happy. We live in an age where it's almost comical for people say they just want to be happy. But it's not. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be loved. Or wanted to be noticed.

 Täpi had a tumour and died at 3 years old. My mum was the only one to even acknowledge that I had the right to be sad but others were literally saying ""it's just a guinea pig, it's not like a dog or anything so it doesn't matter"".

I was really depressed after that and since he died in his sleep I got this habit where I have to check every 10 minutes if Triibu is moving. Their cage is in my room.

2 days ago I wole up in the morning and went to check on him but he wasn't moving. I rattled the cage cause even if he's sleeping he usually reacts to that.

He didn't.

I went downstairs and told my mum. I went outside. In a few minutes she came back and said he wasn't dead yet bus close to it and that I should go be with him. When I got there he was dead.

I couldn't even say goodbye.

And I had to dig the grave and bury him while everyone else was laughing and just chilling in the garden.

 And I can't sleep. And I'm sad. It's too quiet in my room, and all the noises are wrong.

1685151418.0,I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,"Hi everyone, 

About a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country, two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back, tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. 

I think this is interesting for a few reasons. 

1- As I said, I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees, bad back, apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. 

2- Mentally, I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression, bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. 

3- I was raised as a ward of the court, 30+ foster homes, street kid, jail, addiction. Been a hard road. 



So why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province, they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. 


Secondly, if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants, so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now, but I will end up being the same man. 

However, the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island, that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health, he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. 

So I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. 


It's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments, but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs, there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager, I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. 

I have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. 

I have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. 

Both the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. 


I hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives, don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :) 

Thanks.",mentalhealth

1640620601.0,"My Mom passed in September, today a neighbor asked my Dad on a date. Am I a jerk to be upset/hurt about her asking him out when it’s still such a fresh pain for our family?","My Mom passed September 25, 2021.
My parents had been married since 1979 when mom was 18 and dad was 22.
They have 4 sons ages 41, 40, 39, and 37 and then they have me a 17 yr old daughter. 

Today a neighbor stopped by to drop cookies off to my Dad and asked him out on a dinner date. Dad looked right at me and then told her “I’m gonna have to get back to you on that one” 

Backstory on the neighbor: about a month after her husband died (like in 2016ish) she asked my Dad to come home with her one night from a bar party a bunch of the neighbors were at. Since then my Mom wasn’t a huge fan of the neighbor since she tried to convince my Dad to go home with her, and my Dad has avoided this woman like the plague because he wasn’t interested in anyone but my Mom and didn’t want to be asked again. I’ve personally witnessed my Dad jog from his truck to the house so he wouldn’t run into the neighbor and have to talk to her.

My parents were that couple that were still so obviously in love after so many years that anyone around them could see how they felt about one another. 

I obviously want my Dad to be happy and I would never stop him from seeing someone, but am I wrong to not feel quite ready yet to see my Dad with another women 3 months after my Mom passed?

Is it possible he was subtly telling her no without making a scene/awkward?

Am I being childish for being a little stressed about it since it’s only been 3 months and Dad and I are both still having more bad days than good ones?",mentalhealth

We go to school to get a degree only to work a job to pay bills. I understand that are other routes to take but for a majority of people this is unrealistic. Not everyone has the capital to be an entrepreneur. Not everyone has the time to sit down and develop their skills. In American we are slaves to the system until we die. We work until we are full.

This response wasn't out of anger or annoyance, and for once I heard something in his voice that rang a certain sincerity.

I have very low self-esteem and frequently deal with thoughts of not being good enough and feeling like people wouldn't miss me if I wasn't here. When people give me reasons to believe those thoughts, it fucks me up.

When my mom didn't call me on my birthday, I spent the whole day depressed because I thought she didn't care enough to remember.

When my family dog had to be put down suddenly, I was the last one to be told, and had it not been for my brother convincing my dad to call me, I wouldn't have known until the next morning, when she would've already been dead for hours. 

My dad got a new dog yesterday, which I again wasn't told until everyone else had known for a while. He didn't even tell me, my brother accidentally let it slip after they'd been to see it and was asked if they wanted to take her home with them for a few hours as a trial run. 

To anyone else, these would be things easily shrugged off, but they really get to me. Family is supposed to be the people who will want to be around you no matter what, yet I feel they try to avoid me and it sucks. On top of that, when I get emotional over these things, I get told I need to get my shit together and stop being to overdramatic. 

I talked to my brother about the dog-incident, and he told me to stop being so dramatic, and that this wasn't a big deal. To him it wasn't, to me it is. This argument has me in fucking tears cause I'm a mess.

My whole life I've been told my feelings are too much. I was the quiet, shy kid, and was never the one to get attention. However, when I was bullied at school and at home, and developed anxiety, I tried my best to get attention the only way I knew how, pretending to be sick. After the teachers caught on that I was faking, they eventually stopped caring, and let me walk around the school yard crying. It took me so long to realize I was crying because I was extremely anxious and was begging for help. 

Now, having been told my entire life that I'm just overreacting, that's also how I speak to myself. I'll have a literal panic attack, and the only thought in my head is that I'm faking. I still don't actually believe my panic attacks are real, even though the symptoms match up perfectly, but my brain will never give me the benefit of the doubt.

Therapy is not available and people would say I'm making excuses for being lazy/stupid if I tell them about my mental health issues. Since I was a kid, I've always been someone who is emotional, easily triggered, easily stressed out, and tends to overthink. Everyone, even my parents, sees me as ""weak, oversensitive, and dramatic"". They don't believe one can be struggling mentally when they look just fine and ""normal"" physically. There were some critical points in my life when I got panic attacks and cried everyday, I couldn't eat or sleep and was losing weight but my parents were totally helpless (and clueless) because I didn't seem to be sick anywhere looking from the outside.

I don't blame my parents for neglecting my mental health though. They live in such conservative society and had a hard time making ends meet, so I doubt they even have time to learn about something so foreign to them. I blame the whole ""cultural stigma"" in general. I feel like a misfit.

My notes were going down close to getting kick out of the university, lots of debts, No money incomes, sent tons of job applications and no answer, losing friends, weight,started with suicidal thoughs and close to getting suicidal tendencies, was hitting the bottom until I met my gf (current ex) a wonferful woman that helped me go through and push me over to see a specialist because I wanted to be better for me and for her. We are no longer together but thanks to her I am better now, I don't know what could happened if I didn't meet her, I will be forever thankful to her. 

Took me a year to seen my potential and what I was capable, Also to love myself again. Was a difficult journey I will not lie but trust me, it is really worthy.

1609597833.0,Being addicted to daydreaming (Maladaptive daydreaming),"hey um.. I recently found out about this ""disorder"" (i put it in quotes because it is not actually recognized by the DSM)

It is when people daydream very extensively for sometimes hours a day. They create their own highly structured universes and scenarios that help them cope with drama etc.

They often have the urge to that as soon as they wake up. Also while doing that a lot of people engage on repetitive movement (like pacing around). I have heard that psychologists suspect that it activates certain areas in the brain that control your imagination or might effect it in a hypnotic way (((excuse my wording i am not a native speaker lol)))

Those people do NOT gaslight themself. In fact most of MDers are able to tell which of their memories are within their paracosm/imagination and which are not.

Effects of this intense daydreaming is that people with that ""disorder"" sometimes find it very hard to focus on ANYTHING.

Some people argue that daydreaming is natural and MD should not be regarded as a mental illness. I think it certainly has characteristics of a mental illness. It is a coping mechanism at the beginning but at some point MDers find themself daydreaming all day because they got so used to living in this paracosm that they don´t enjoy reality as much anymore. And this is an endless circle. Because if you don´t do stuff with other people or your friends, and avoid your responsibilities and flee in your paracosm your live will get more miserable and your imagined friends, scenarios and word will look more and more appealing.

I recently found out that i might have this ""disorder"". I have stumbled across this because I had problems with not being able to live in the present. A lot of my scenarios are about my future and they are often highly fantastical. So instead of actually doing stuff that might bring me to a future that i might enjoy i just dream about already being there.

Since then i am always searching for new information on this subject and one researcher that does amazing work within this field is Eli Somer. He was the first one who recognized it and publishes a lot of videos about MD on youtube.

Here is his channel: [https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic](https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic)

If you have any thoughts, or further research sources please drop them here. And especially if you have experience with this subject first hand.

I just want people to know that this is real and effects people.

1604786487.0,Even if nobody reads this..,"writing is a form of therapy that releases the pressure in my heart and brain and allows me to cope. It helps me make sense of and mop up the gray matter. I have felt pain, I have felt joy, I have felt grief, and I have feared for my life but nothing matches the nameless emotion waging war on me. For those who don’t personally know me, I am making a drastic move for the betterment of myself and my family financially and this is the battle I’m facing inside. I’ve felt so absent from myself and completely empty. Watching my house go from years of being the safe place for sailors, laughter, gatherings, hot meals, and an ear, to thin bare walls and empty rooms broke me in ways I never thought possible. People I’ve loved have weaved in and out of those rooms without thought in search of a place to call home, and here I am staring at the worn paint and marks along the walls from memories of beer pong, twister, and indoor dodgeball amongst other absurd things, wondering where the time went and if I’ll ever feel family like I have over the several years I’ve built and nurtured my circle. I don’t believe for a single moment that I wasn’t meant to experience the connections and the love that I’ve felt here, but with that comes the inevitable goodbyes. The halting end of a time that saved my life. Nothing teaches you how to introduce yourself and part ways all in the same breath quite like the Navy, but it never gets easier. No more dinners with friends gathering around the table to feel a sense of family where our respective families are absent. No more beer pong nights with 90’s hits, or spontaneous card game nights. My world has fallen silent. Laughter became tears, joy became pain, and I don’t know what to do with the things that I feel. You’d think I’d be good at this as I’ve been away from those I love and grew up with for 7 years. However, I am not. I am truly weak inside and empty. I didn’t know how else to express the grief that I feel other than to write this out, though I know not many will make it this far into the novels that I write about my internal war. Please hold your friends close while you have the time, because tomorrow you could be moving across the country with nothing but a back pack and shoes and nobody to walk beside you.

A responder started berating me for not taking the kid to therapy. I explained to them that I live in a South Asian country so accessing and affording therapy for us is extremely difficult. I'm struggling a lot with mental health. They started blaming me for not adding a disclaimer that I'm south Asian in the main post, it's not their fault for being mean to me, the majority of the users are Americans, if I need advice then I better add this in the disclaimer.
I understand that most Reddit users are American but I thought teacher-student connection is universal irrespective of nationality. I don't understand why can't people put aside their nationality. I have had great insightful conversations with lots of people on Reddit, but I occasionally receive judgemental opinions like this. Why can't people open up to others experiences, if not then at least try to be compassionate? It sometimes does make me feel that no matter what we do, people from developing countries will always be considered stupid and unwanted.

Edit- thank you so much for such heartwarming and encouraging responses. I wish to clarify that I still have equal respect for Americans as I do for every other being regardless of their background.

1557235248.0,"To anyone who was hurt, abused, manipulated or ridiculed by parents/caregivers: it's not your fault and it's not your job to fix them and their shitty problems.","I have come to fully understand something, at 25 years of age - it's not your fault how adults treated you when you were a kid. You literally had not a single ounce of control over their stupidity, selfishness and incapability.

If you were abused, hurt, ripped apart by their words or even physically injured by those so-called grown-ups in your childhood, **it is absolutely and categorically not your fault**. And it is not your job to fix it. It's not your job now and it wasn't your job then. You had no control over their actions and no responsibility for them. They had the responsibility to care for you and they messed it up big time. You did not ask to be born into the situation you were born into. You were a vulnerable child whose needs, for some reason or another, were not fully met. And that rests entirely with the adults, not with you. A child can never be blamed for that. And the child who turns into the adult should not blame themselves for their parents' shortcomings, either.

Also, **you owe them nothing**. They may have fed you and put a roof over your head, but if they otherwise treated you like shit, or still do treat you like shit, walk away and don't look back. Now you're an adult and you have choices and autonomy over your own life. You don't need to be around them if you don't want to, or if it doesn't feel safe and secure.

1694159407.0,My parents were having sex next to me and it fucked me up,"Hi guys. Just wanted to vent a bit about some of my childhood traumatic experieces.
When I was a child my parents had been having sex next to me in the same bed. My first memories are from around when I was 5 years old. They were doing it thinking I was asleep but I was too scared to tell them I am not and that I see and understand everything. I started then to make some noises during their sex so they could feel uncomfortable and they stopped doing it since I was about 7 because they moved me into my own room.
The thing is that it made me sexual way too young. I had my first sex with my female best friend when I was 8. I literally was repeating what I saw and I actually even experienced pleasure. She didn't even probably knew what I was doing. When her mother found out she was mad af. I remember my friend came to me and said we are not allowed to spend time together in her room anymore. After a while I started touching myself and putting some toys inside to feel pleasure. I was just 8 years old...
I feel so fucked up in my brain from all of this. I feel horrible for what I did. I feel gross about myself, I feel as a pervert and rapist. I hate myself for being so sexual. I had a very messy sexual life afterwards with a lot of partners and I was even cheating because sex was my weakness. I am ashamed of myself. I stopped having sex now because I feel like a perv. I don't know how to overcome this trauma and what can help. Did anyone else go through something similar? Please shine some light on this if you did. Thank you.

Update: Thank you all for such a support. I feel much better after reading your comments about the fact I was just a child and is not my fault I wasn't taught about sex and what's right and what's not. I also want to mention that I am a female and already an adult, it was more than 20 years ago but I kept this within myself for a long time because of shame and guilt I felt.

Despite my efforts I’m failing multiple classes at the fault of my teachers unable to cope with online learning resources. My parents believe I’m just slacking off when really I am working until the early hours of the morning everyday.

All of the pressure from school and my parents are blinding me from recognizing that I’m trying my absolute best and that the things that bother me the most right now are not my fault.

After all, I beat my depression, I’ve made new friends, I got my license recently, and summer is right around the corner even if I have to do summer school at the rate things are going.

Ultimately, I just want to hear from somebody that they’re proud of me. I don’t get to hear it from the people I wish would say it, but I know people know my struggle right now and have struggled far more than me and it means a lot to hear it from people that understand.

My entire family sees us as the same, so now I have a fear of making any mistake no matter how minor.

What’s even worse is that my parents never taught me to apologize. I don’t know how and I feel incredibly awkward doing so.

I loved that girl more with all my heart. We’d been together since high school and all throughout college. She was diagnosed with cancer a few months after we graduated and died approximately six months later. It was obviously very painful for everybody involved, but she and I made our peace. 

After that, I completely focused myself in my career, and I’ve seen a lot of success in it. I’m in a very good place right now professionally. To get through this, I refused to even look at any girl I found even remotely attractive for like three years. I just didn’t want to feel anything that would remind me of her. Regrettably, I think it’s made me somewhat of a cold hearted person, but it was just like the light of my life was destroyed. 

About a year ago, I met this one girl through a mutual friend, and something about her and I just kind of clicked. I’ve been official for about four months now, and I really like her; however, ever since I started to become close to her, I’ve been having these sort of panic attacks where I just can’t stop thinking about my old girlfriend. I repressed these emotions for so long it’s all flooding back to me at once and I can’t handle it. I haven’t told this new girl for obvious reasons, but I think she’s beginning to suspect that something’s up.

He answered ""Mmmm...mayyyyyyybe!""

OMG I am so happy that he feels confident and trusts me enough to tell me that!

1542385039.0,My whole world just collapsed.,"My fiancé walked out on me last night out of nowhere. We’ve always had an amazing, strong relationship, or so I thought. I was putting dinner on his plate, a normal evening, until he mentioned he didn’t want much because his stomachs been upset and he can’t eat. When I asked why... that’s when my world ended. We have been together for 11 years, engaged for only 4 months. For the last 5 years, I’ve been living with terminal cancer and he’s been my rock. My mental health has been very touchy as one can imagine having incurable cancer and he’s been the one thing keeping me here and fighting. I actually did a clinical trial that surprisingly helped me. We’re just getting to a place with my health where maybe I can live a “normal” life. We’re supposed to be leaving on vacation in a few weeks and finally got to a point where we can plan things for the future. Theres so much coming up. I’ve been improving myself and my mental health A LOT. He says he sees these improvements and they should make him happy, but it doesn’t. He told me when I just had my scans, he should’ve felt something, but he didn’t. He’s lost his compassion for me and isn’t in love with me anymore. I supported him through school and now that he’s done, he’s not only my emotional, but my financial rock, as well as helping me with things my disability makes hard. I don’t have much family and I lost a lot of people when I was diagnosed with cancer. He threw in my face that he wants children and I can’t provide that (this isn’t anything new) and when I said I was getting to a point in my health where I could start looking into options for how to have kids he said, “even if we could, is it smart to bring a child into this world not knowing if they’ll have a mom around?” Not being able to have kids has been one of the hardest things that i struggle with, and he knows that and always reassured me that I was more important. I didn’t even know this person talking to me. So cold, empty. I feel so hurt because many times at the beginning of my diagnosis, I told him to leave me so that I didn’t have to drag him into this life and he always promised me he wouldn’t have it any other way. He told me he’s not happy with his life and his priorities have changed and he doesn’t want to resent me. We never even argued. We were the couple people looked up to and my life collapsed around me in a matter of seconds. I’m having to tell people today and they’re not even believing it. Everything was perfect and then everything was gone. I don’t know how to live without him. I don’t even know how I can make this work. I’m so hurt and angry. Why propose mere months ago after 10 years just for this to happen? How can you just leave as things were getting okay and after I had everything in my life already ripped away with cancer and was trying to figure out how to rebuild and finally have a “normal” life? I haven’t slept, I can’t eat. I’m scared of what I might do when reality sets in. I’m going to die alone. Nobody wants to be with the amputee with cancer and I’m devastated. My self esteem has never been lower. I can’t have kids. I’m going to die alone. And a part of me wishes my cancer was bad again and it would take me sooner so I don’t have to do this anymore.

It was a great conversation because I had no idea she had felt that way because it always seemed like she wasn’t interested in spending time with me and she would decline most of the time. We are planning on doing some fitness activity together but we are still figuring out what, she wanted to weight lift but our local gyms don’t allow children under 15. 

She even stopped wearing her jacket which I felt like was huge so I think we are making good progress. Just hoping we can stick with it through hard times as well.",mentalhealth

1614809272.0,This has been the shittiest week i’ve had in a long time,"Guys, my mental health has declined so quickly this week, and I just need to get this off of my chest. 

To start with some background, I suffer from anxiety and depression, and I’m in recovery for anorexia (have been for 1 1/2 years). This semester is one of my hardest ones, as I’m taking 16 credit hours in 8 weeks, and it’s made me incredibly anxious, and has made my eating disorder come back into play. I feel like I’m dying because of the weight loss and my heart pounding at all times of the day. 

My cousin got into an extremely bad car accident two weeks ago, and she’s in a coma, had broken her neck and jaw, and the doctors are extremely pessimistic about her recovering. They believe that IF she wakes up, she’ll be a vegetable. This is my favourite cousin; she’s so hardworking, caring, and compassionate, and she has three kiddos all under age 5. Their dad is not in the picture, so they’ve been bouncing from relative to relative, and they’re at my house currently. I’m 24, in graduate school, and have no kids of my own, so this alone has flipped my world upside down. 

Last night, I got a call from my mom that my grandfather is on hospice, and will likely pass away either this weekend or early next week. I have to figure out how I’m going to get to the funeral with the kids, manage my school work (I have two exams this weekend and finals are next week), and have to find someone to cover my shifts while I travel for the funeral. 

I just feel defeated. All of my hard work to get my anxiety and eating under control feels like it’s completely for nothing. Everything feels out of control in my life, and it feels like a runaway train that I have to catch with my bare hands. This week especially has beat me down, and I don’t know how to get back up.",mentalhealth
1610417809.0,Is there anyone else Who is scared of phone calls?,"I have extreme anxiety for phone calls and more if its video call, I never did a video call, I used to talk to my friends when I was 7-8 years old. But everytime I talk to anyone my parents will try to listen to me. And then I need to tell my parents what I talk about and who I was talking to in details. Sometimes they also force me to on speaker while I talk with my friend so they can judge if my friends r good or bad. One time they also snatched my phone while I was talking with a friend.  
and my mom will tell me my voice is not high enough, my talking pace is not good enough, I am not being polite enough etc etc.  


So that's why I reduced calling friends and eventually totally stopped.   
i am 20 years old now & I have not talked to anyone on phone call since last 5 years except parent and one or two of my teachers. I don't even talk to my relatives or my own cousin brother and sister.  


i hardly find a good friend online bcos I have none in real life, but I lost two good friends bcos I did not talk to them on phone call. now I am about to finish my studies and I have to call and receive calls from companies regarding my internship, I am scared as fuck, Idk what to do:(((((",mentalhealth

I've had a meth addiction for quite some time now. A few hours ago, I ended up buying some fake shit. Looked completely legit but wasn't. I had a fire in my stomach that hurt so bad I started bawling. I went to message the dude on my Facebook and found out he blocked me. So I sat there for about 5 minutes seething with rage. This is definitely not the first time this had happened. Suddenly, I started laughing. Not just giggling, but full blown hysterical howls of laughter. 

How stupid was I for allowing myself to get ripped off after several times of it happening?? I could have done something useful with that money. So I just shook my head, smiling, and got onto another Facebook account and messaged him. I simply said ""We both know what you did, and it's alright. Karma will take care of it. Peace.""

I put my phone down and immediately got up,, put my meth pipe on the floor, and stomped it, shattering it. 

I'm done. Recovery is a long road. I've beaten heroin. I can do this.

I will sometimes seek out material that upsets me deliberately in order to ‘snap out of it’ and feel something, but that doesn’t seem to work either.

It reduces my existence to nothing more than a NPC character on the lives of others, I only exist for their benefit, and everything I feel is necessary to continue experiencing for their benefit.

One day I was crying and having a mental breakdown and my mom got so mad at me because I would not stop yelling and sobbing.

A sudden point she said that we needed to go to the doctor and I was asking her why.
She told me these exact words “we are going to a doctor to see what the **** is wrong with you”.


Total confusion, didn’t know what she meant, we got into the car and we went to a weird place that I don’t remember what it was exactly, I know for sure that there was people that where waiting in the hallway and some of them where injured.

They called out my mom’s name and we went into an office, they where sitting two woman, they started to ask me questions, like how I was doing and what I liked to do in the free time etc.

I didn’t talk because of anxiety, literally not a word.

A sudden point they asked if they could talk to me alone without my mom, she said yes.

A sudden point I just started crying after she left the room, I was telling them that I didn’t want to live anymore And that everything was so stressful for me, specially at school because everyone was making fun on me.

They continued asking me questions and told them that I was not happy and didn’t want to do anything because I felt like it would serve me no purpose.

I talked to them for an hour, after that they let my mother in, they told her that I needed to come back because clearly something was wrong and they needed to starting sessions with me to help me out.

Once we got home my mom really got angry at me, she literally told me that all that was a waste of time and that of course something was wrong with me but she didn’t want to spend another penny on me for my problems.

I left the house and it almost went terribly, but I did it.","So nobody knows who I am but a few weeks ago I put up [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/oh37fp/how_to_get_out_of_the_house_without_it_seeming/) on this sub asking how to discretely go outside and what I should do (keep in mind I'm about as shut in as a shut-in gets.)

I only got 1 reply on the post, which btw, thank you u/Azarqo I meant to reply to your post but I ended up taking 3 whole weeks to push myself to find the post again. Anyway, I tried their suggestion and it worked... 50/50. By that I mean 1 part went really sour and the other actually was pretty good. Overall success, if you round up.

What happened exactly, if you read my last post I wanted to leave the house without causing my parents to worry about my mental state or wellbeing. That didn't go very well, at ALL. The moment I said ""Well you guys always say I should leave the room and go somewhere so I am now."" they immediately invited me to a talk in the living room about if I'm going out to meet someone or if there's something they should know or if I'm alright. Nope. nah. I'm good. Just... leaving... to wal-mart... yeah cuz everywhere else is closed now... no I'm alright...

I ended up inviting my brother cuz he also sits in bed all day and my Dad suggested it and me and my brother are really chill with each other. Eventually they're like ""Ok, I mean we're not stopping you, so... if there's anything you need to tell us, yknow-"" and me and my brother are out. Finally. It felt like rolling a 2 on a d20 but still succeeding (which I guess implies this was hard to screw up, but oh well)

Now the good part, we DID end up going to walmart. You may be wondering why in ALL of the places walmart? Well, I don't know a lot of places that aren't stores or places where you can walk in without some expectation of you spending money there (I mean, why else do people build buildings, eh?) My original plan was to go to the library but fun fact about the library: It just so happens on Thursdays and only Thursdays they close at 6PM instead of 9PM. And I was leaving the house later than I had initially planned to, since I spent so much time preparing and working up the nerve to tell my parents. Also we live in the middle of frick-off nowhere, and Walmart and the library are like 10-15 minute drives away from my home. There weren't many options, I tell you. (btw I found out I live there because my parents didn't want neighbors and liked the peace and quiet, which explains why we live at the end of a dead-end street and why I grew up very sheltered and very asocial.)

Walmart was fun. Especially since my brother is really into old stuff that we used to always be hyped about like nerf guns and lego. I told him I don't have anything to pay off so let's buy useless stuff, and we did. Checkout line was long as usual. No one was wearing a mask, as usual. I then remembered that Dunkin' Donuts closes at 9PM and it was almost 8, so I asked him if he wanted a donut since we have time. This is a weird bit that's unimportant to the story, but I want to bring it up anyway. We get there (literally across the street from Walmart) and we reach the doors. The employees see us, and just... leave. One dude literally tried to stand behind the computer so we wouldn't see him, even after rattling the door that has the hours printed on them. Ok... you guys just... not want anyone in here..? We end up leaving, donut-less and heartbroken... but oh well, at least I had made the effort to drive out, which I guess was the whole point.

The cool thing after that is that my parents seemed fairly cool about the situation afterword when I got home. I guess they had time to think it over while we were out as opposed to me appearing suddenly in proper clothes all like ""ah yes I've decided to go *outside* today!"" They treated me as if I had just came back from work, or turning in some checks at the bank. Just ""so what'd you guys do? Oh, cool cool"" you get the idea. My mom also looked up reviews on that dunkin' and apparently it has a reputation for bad service and willful ignorance, so ok I guess.

So, that was sure an experience that felt awkward and painful at the start, but *hopefully* I can just force it into becoming a normal thing. I plan on going to the Library next, probably by myself this time. Just to do some sketching and checking out some drawing guides and good reads. Then, they'll have no choice but to let me go back when I have to return the books. I'm telling you guys, it's the perfect plan. I'm only concerned with how my parents think about me now. They really, truly sounded concerned about me earlier, but bro I'm just trying to *do things* that normal people do everyday.

So yeah. Success.",mentalhealth

I live in one of the best cities for healthcare (Boston), have good insurance and still - we have called over 20 child therapists that aren’t accepting new patients and have had Boston Children’s Hospital recommend a partial hospitalization program and guess what?

1545258516.0,Made my first therapist appointment!,"This is a HUGE deal for me. I'm 26 and during my entire life, my parents have yelled and screamed that mental health, more specifically anxiety and depression, wasn't a real thing. They often dismiss anything that they don't want to accept, anything that might be a real issue. I wasn't allowed to go to a therapist, even when the school counselor brought me in almost weekly (mostly in middle school) to talk about well, anything. They were just trying to get something out of me but I often thought I was in trouble and didn't really understand why I kept getting taken out of class. 

So I've been struggling with my demons my entire life, looking for ways to cope, most of the time it was through drugs/alcohol, but I've cut down on that a lot. A close friend of mine has repeatedly told me over and over that I need to go talk to a therapist, and he's tried to convince me that I'm not crazy because I need help. Over and over and over again I told him that I didn't need to, I was fine, I just need to vent sometimes. I guess though, after my last episode a couple days ago, I was going on and on about how I just wasted my whole life, how I keep wasting time, how I don't have a direction, how I'm afraid to leave, how I'm afraid to act on things, how I'm indecisive, etcetcetc and he just flat out told me again that I really really need to seek someone out and it's not because he didn't want to help, he just doesn't know how to get to the root of my problem.

After some extensive research, I found a really nice counseling office right by my house. The counselor has a therapy dog too! My first appointment is on January 2, right after I get out of work.
